  <description>With over twenty volumes, the <i>Nicene and 
Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered 
by 
Philip Schaff, the <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> is a collection 
of 
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of 
such a collection is to make their writings readily available. The 
entire work is divided into two series. The first series focuses on two 
classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. 
St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian 
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two 
works--the <i>Confessions</i> and the <i>City of God</i>--these volumes 
also 
contain 
other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine, such as <i>On the 
Holy Trinity</i>, <i>Christian Doctrine</i>, and others. St. John 
Chrysostom 
was 
an 
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a 
more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused 
on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly what is now called 
social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged abuses of 
authority. This volume contains St. John Chrysostom's homilies on the 
<i>Gospel of Matthew</i>. Widely regarded as an eloquent speaker, 
these 
homilies are a wonder to behold. The <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene 
Fathers</i> 
is 
comprehensive in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and 
illuminating texts from some of the greatest theologians of the 
Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts have aided 
Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and 
fruitful even today!<br /><br />Tim Perrine<br />CCEL Staff Writer

<p class="c2" id="ii-p2">
————————————</p>

<p class="c12" id="ii-p3"><span class="c11" id="ii-p3.1">This</span> volume, according to the
previous announcement of the publishers, contains a reprint of the
Oxford edition of the Homilies of St. Chrysostom on the gospel of St.
Matthew.</p>

<p class="c13" id="ii-p4">The Homilies on this Gospel formed three volumes of the
Oxford edition, published respectively in 1843, 1844, and 1851. The
dedication appears in the third volume, as a memorial of Archbishop
Howley, who died in 1848. The preface is from the pen of Charles
Marriott of Oriel College.</p>

<p class="c13" id="ii-p5">As regards the present volume, it may be remarked that
the archaic style of the English translation has been preserved without
material alteration. Even when obscure and involved, the form seemed to
be a fitting dress for the original. Occasionally an amendation, or
rather suggestion, has been made in a foot-note by the American editor.
The spelling has been altered throughout by the printer, to accord with
the usage more common among us. Some obvious typographical errors have
been corrected, and these have usually been indicated. Instead of the
brackets, used in the Oxford edition, to mark words or phrases supplied
by the translator, <i>Italics</i> have been substituted. The same
remark applies to passages where the Greek text is in doubt. The editor
has felt at liberty to indicate more fully than the translator the
portions supplied by the latter. In a few cases an emphatic word is
printed in Italics, but these instances can be readily distinguished
from the passages above referred to.</p>

<p class="c13" id="ii-p6">The English translator of these Homilies was fortunate
in having the Greek text of Mr. Frederick Field as the basis of his
renderings. This text is also accessible in the edition of Migne, and
has been compared throughout in the preparation of this volume. At the
time when the Oxford edition appeared textual criticism had received
but slight attention in England; hence the translator seems to have
occasionally failed to estimate aright the value of the authorities for
various readings. But in few patristic works do we have better security
for the accuracy of the text than in the case of these Homilies on
Matthew. The labor of the American editor has been, of course,
supplementary. Attention has been called quite frequently to the Greek
phrase used in the Homily, with a view to marking the usage in
Ecclesiastical Greek. Many foot-notes have been added, to indicate the
readings of the New Testament text appearing in the Homilies. The
constant use of the Authorized

<pb n="iv" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_iv.html" id="ii-Page_iv" />

Version by the translator made this necessary. The Greek
phrase has frequently been given; still more frequently the rendering
(and reading) of the Revised version. Where these agree with the text
of the Homily, they are cited, without comment, in brackets.
Differences between readings are carefully indicated.</p>

<p class="c13" id="ii-p7">Occasionally the editor has noted his dissent from the
renderings or annotations of the translator, but he has not felt
warranted in expressing every difference of judgment. All additions
made in this volume are enclosed in brackets, and except in cases where
the Revised Version is cited without comment, the letter R. has been
appended.</p>

<p class="c13" id="ii-p8">Much time and care have been bestowed upon the
Indexes.</p>

<p class="c2" id="iii.ii-p2">
————————————</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.ii-p3"><span class="c11" id="iii.ii-p3.1">The</span> Homilies of St. Chrysostom
on St. Matthew were undoubtedly delivered at Antioch (see Hom. vii. p.
43) and probably in the latter part of the time during which he
preached as a Presbyter. Montfaucon considers his little mention of the
sin of swearing a sign of his having accomplished some reformation on
that point by his previous exertions. In the Homilies delivered from
386 to 388, it is a constant topic; and the Homilies known to belong to
that date are so numerous, as scarcely leave room for such a series as
the present. These, however, contain very little to mark the period to
which they belong. The argument from his reference to dissensions some
time gone by, possibly those between St. Meletius and Paulinus and
Evagrius, in commenting on St. <scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 6" id="iii.ii-p3.2" parsed="|Matt|23|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.6">Matt. xxiii. 6</scripRef>. is not very conclusive.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.ii-p4">A modern reader must sometimes be struck with finding in
St. Chrysostom a kind of criticism, which we are apt to think belongs
only to later times. His main object, however, is moral, and he
searches out with diligence both the meaning and the applications of
particular passages, usually concluding with an eloquent exhortation to
some special virtue. Some of the most remarkable of these exhortations
are on the subject of Alms-giving, which he seems to have pressed with
some success at last. His calculation in Hom. lxvi. as to what might be
done, is somewhat curious. In the end of Hom. lxxxviii. he demands a
reformation as the condition of his entering on the controversy with
Infidels. In the next Homily he discusses the evidence of the

against an objector.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.ii-p5">The Theatres are the theme of his frequent reprobation,
and the Monks of the mountains near Antioch of his praise. In Hom.
lxix. and lxx. he describes their mode of life as an edifying example
to all. He frequently attacks the Anomœan or extreme Arian Heresy,
and sometimes also the Manichæan. It is perhaps worth while to
recollect the nearly contemporaneous prevalence of Manichæism in
the West, as it appears in the early history of St. Augustine. In Hom.
lxxxvi. there are some remarks on the device of Satan by which evil is
introduced by little and little, which are worthy of consideration as
applicable to the growth of erroneous doctrine and practice within the
Church.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.ii-p6">For all information with respect to the Text and
Manuscripts of these Homilies, the learned reader is referred to the
Greek Edition of Mr. Field, which has been of great service, as
affording a safe basis for the Translation. The paucity of materials
possessed by Savile, and the carelessness of the Benedictine Editor,
had left much room for improvement by a judicious and faithful use of
the existing copies. It may now at last be hoped, that we have a Text
very closely approximating to the genuine work of the Author.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.ii-p7">For the Translation, the Editors are indebted to the

complete the commentaries of St. Chrysostom on the New Testament, by
bringing out the remainder of the Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles,
and those on the Epistle to the Hebrews, as soon as they are able. In
both instances, however, the corrupt state of the Text has occasioned
some difficulty and delay.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iii.i-p6">Nor has there been any serious difference of opinion in
regard to his personal character. His intense moral earnestness has
always been recognized, and the man has been honored because it was
distinctly felt that the man gave power to the oration. “Golden

rhetorical training of his earlier years doubtless contributed much to
his skill as a preacher, but his exegetical method was perhaps a still
more important factor.</p>

<p class="c39" id="iii.iii.ii-p1"><span class="c11" id="iii.iii.ii-p1.1">I. The Place of Chrysostom in the
History of Exegesis.</span></p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iii.ii-p2">The position held by Chrysostom in the history of
exegesis is remarkable. Owing to a peculiar combination of
circumstances he, more than any of the Fathers, was enabled to avoid
the errors alike of the allegorizing and dogmatic tendencies. The
former tendency was the prevalent one in the Christian Church in the
Ante-Nicene period; the latter, especially in the West, became dominant
during the Post-Nicene period, using for its own ends the earlier
erroneous theory. Chrysostom represents the Antiochian reaction against
the allegorizing method, while he ante-dates by a generation, at least,
the time when the ecclesiastical or dogmatic theory became overpowering
in its influence. This historical position must be recognized in
estimating his character as an exegete, as well as in accounting for
his eminence as an interpreter of Scripture. Modern scholarship with
comparative unanimity accords to him this eminence. It is true that one
is disposed to dissent from this judgment on first reading the Homilies
of Chrysostom. Trained in our modern exegetical methods the reader may
unconsciously compare the expositions of the Greek Father with those of
Luther and Calvin, if not with those of Meyer and Weiss. Such a
comparison is of course an anachronism. A study of other patristic
exegetes must lead to an endorsement of the prevalent opinion as to the
merits of Chrysostom as an expositor. An immense mass of homiletical
literature of which he was the author has been preserved, and of course
reveals very unequal results. Marks of carelessness, especially in
citation, abound; the habits of the “practical preacher”
often leads to long digressions, to elaboration of matters that at best
hold only the relation of a tangent to the truth of the text. Yet less
than most

<pb n="xviii" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_xviii.html" id="iii.iii.ii-Page_xviii" />

pulpit orators does
Chrysostom warp the interpretation itself to suit his homiletical
purpose. Occasionally vehement invective occurs when an exegetical
difficulty is encountered, and it is easy to suppose that unconsciously
the former has been used to cover up the latter. But there are few
evidences of lack of candor in the treatment of such difficulties. It
must be confessed that Chrysostom is not always true to his own
principles of interpretation, yet these instances of inconsistency are
usually due to a desire to enforce an ethical lesson pertinent to the
occasion, even though the application was scarcely pertinent to the
text. Owing to his ignorance of Hebrew, Chrysostom was not properly
equipped for the work of expounding the Old Testament. He treats the
LXX. as though it were of final authority, save in a few instances
where the variations of other Greek versions have occasioned
discussion. Frequently he makes use of verbal suggestions of the Greek
that have no warrant in the Hebrew text. Yet, where he is not thus
misled, his comments on the Old Testament present the same
characteristics as those on the New.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iii.ii-p3">The most marked peculiarity of Chrysostom as an exegete
is his comparative freedom from the allegorizing tendency that
prevailed in the early Christian centuries. In contending with the
Jews, the Christian apologists, from Justin Martyr onward, had
inevitably followed to some extent the methods of their opponents. The
Jewish schools of interpreters, both at Alexandria and in Palestine,
while somewhat antagonistic to each other, had in common this
allegorizing habit. Argument about the meaning of the Old Testament
necessarily fostered a similar tendency among Christian writers.
Moreover, the Christian authors of the second and third centuries were
not men of pre-eminent talent or acquirements. The victory won by the
church was ethical rather than intellectual. Then, as now, profound
piety, when not combined with accurate knowledge and mental acumen,
delighted in mystical fancies. Types could be invented far more easily
than texts could be investigated. At length this tendency found in
Origen an advocate who had the ability to formulate its principles, and
also the learning and industry necessary to illustrate the method by
copious comments of his own. <i>Facile princeps</i> as a mystical
interpreter, Origen’s influence is still felt, and in his own age
it was dominant in exegesis. It is true the dogmatic principle was
already gaining the mastery, yet both the Orthodox and their opponents
made use of allegory: the former combined the two tendencies, the
latter placed them in antagonism. Curiously enough the doctrinal
controversy that arose in consequence of some of Origen’s views
was made the occasion of an attack upon Chrysostom, and the kindness he
showed to certain Egyptian monks, who were followers of Origen, became
the pretext for those harsh measures which resulted in his banishment
and death.<note n="1" id="iii.iii.ii-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iii.ii-p4">See <span class="c20" id="iii.iii.ii-p4.1">Stephens</span>, <i>Life of
St. Chrysostom</i>, pp. 286–326; <span class="c20" id="iii.iii.ii-p4.2">Schaff</span>,
<i>History of the Christian Church</i>, vol. III., pp. 702 et seq.</p></note> Yet Chrysostom, in his writings, shows no sympathy with the philosophic
speculations of Origen, and his method as an exegete is far removed
from that implied in the principles laid down by the latter. The great
preacher never dishonors the literal, or historical, sense of
Scripture, and though he occasionally refers to interpretations <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iii.ii-p4.3">κατ
ναγωγν</span>, using the phrase applied
by Origen to the mystical sense of passages, these are never exalted
above the plain meaning of the words of the text. No one living in the
age of Chrysostom could be a diligent student of the Bible and ignore
the labors of Origen. Despite his advocacy of the mystical theory and
his excessive speculative tendency he had done more for exegetical
theology than any of his predecessors. In these days we owe him too
much to forget these services. The wonder is that Chrysostom, familiar
with his writings, was so little influenced by the erroneous
hermeneutical principles he advocated and exemplified. The earnest
practical purpose of Chrysostom did much in preserving him from
allegorizing, but his training of Antioch under Diodorus, afterwards
bishop of Tarsus, was probably still more influential for good.
Diodorus is reckoned the leader of the so-called Antiochian school of
exegetes.

<pb n="xix" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_xix.html" id="iii.iii.ii-Page_xix" />

He was the first to
oppose directly the false methods of Origen. It is true “the
Three Cappadocians,” Basil the Great, his brother Gregory of
Nyssa, and his friend Gregory of Nazianzen, had but a qualified
admiration for the exegetical results attained by Origen, though
diligent in their use of his writings. The conflicts of the period
interfered, however, with any decided hermeneutical advance; the
dogmatic interest of the Arian controversy still overshadowing all
other theological movements. Diodorus (†394) was president of a
monastery in the vicinity of Antioch. Under his guidance Chrysostom and
his friend Basil pursued a semi-monastic life of seclusion and study
for nearly six years (ending in A.D. 381). Theodore, who was afterwards
bishop of Mopsuestia, and the father of the Nestorian theology, was
also his friend and fellow-student. While Diodorus was not free from
rationalizing tendencies, he undoubtedly represents a healthy re-action
toward the historico-exegetical theory of interpretation. His writings
and his influence on his two most distinguished pupils, Chrysostom and
Theodore, plainly prove this. “The practical element in Diodorus,
his method of literal and common-sense interpretation of Holy
Scripture, was inherited chiefly by Chrysostom; the intellectual vein,
his conceptions of the relation between the Godhead and Manhood in
Christ, his opinions respecting the final restoration of mankind, which
were almost equivalent to a denial of eternal punishment, were
reproduced mainly by Theodore.”<note n="2" id="iii.iii.ii-p4.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iii.ii-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.iii.ii-p5.1">Stephens</span> <i>St.

<i>History of the New Testament</i>, II., pp. 542–6, American
edition.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iii.ii-p6">While the influence of the Antiochian school seems
transient, it has achieved much in stating more clearly the correct
principles of interpretation; it has achieved still more in preparing
for his work the greatest preacher of the Greek church. Avoiding to a
great extent the extremes of both Origen and Diodorus, Chrysostom as an
interpreter is probably nearer to us than any Father of the Eastern
Church. A careful study of his Homilies must lead to that conviction.
“He set forth the verbal meaning with constant attention to the
course of thought, and connected therewith, in harmony with the form
which he had chosen, the religious and moral observations which were
founded directly on the text. Dogmatic and polemic digressions were not
necessarily excluded, but were never made the principal thing, and the
more or less frequently inserted allegorical additions appear rather as
rhetorical ornament and deference to custom than as something necessary
to the expositor.”<note n="3" id="iii.iii.ii-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iii.ii-p7"><span class="c11" id="iii.iii.ii-p7.1">Reuss</span>, <i>History New
Testament</i>, p. 544, American edition.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iii.ii-p8">The doctrinal views of Chrysostom were positive and
usually well defined. He does not fail to oppose heretical opinions. So
great a preacher could not be without a theology. Yet, as already
intimated, the dogmatic principle of interpretation does not dominate
his exegesis to any great extent.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iii.ii-p9">It thus appears that, whatever may be defects in his
expositions, however faulty his comments may seem to us, Chrysostom
stands as the representative of more correct principles than any of the
early Fathers. That his eminence as a preacher is due to this fact can
scarcely be doubted. A new interest in his writings would serve to
emphasize the importance of adherence to the historico-exegetical
method of interpretation. Great pulpit orators do not need to indulge
in mystical fancies, nor does their true power arise from dogmatic
warping of the sense of Scripture.</p>

Chrysostom’s Exegetical Labors.</span></p>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p2">1. The exegetical labors of Chrysostom are embodied in
his Homilies, of which more than six hundred have been preserved. These
are for the most part expository in their character, usually forming a
continuous series upon some book of Scripture. The parts of

<pb n="xx" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_xx.html" id="II_1-Page_xx" />

the Bible thus treated are: in the Old
Testament, Genesis and the Book of Psalms; in the New Testament, all
the books except the gospels of Mark and Luke, the Catholic Epistles
and Revelation. “Commentaries, properly so-called, he wrote only
on the first eight chapters of Isaiah and on the Epistle to the
Galatians” (Schaff<note n="4" id="II_1-p2.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p3"><i>History of the Christian Church</i>, III., p.
939.</p></note>). Most of the Homilies were preserved by short-hand reports, but some
were published by Chrysostom himself.<note n="5" id="II_1-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p4"><span class="c11" id="II_1-p4.1">Stephens</span>, <i>St.
Chrysostom</i>, p. 427. He refers to <span class="c41" id="II_1-p4.2">Tillemont</span>, <i>Memoires</i>, vol. xi. p. 37.</p></note> There are internal evidences that in many cases the spoken discourse
had not been previously written, <i>e.g</i>., the rebuke of applause
and of inattention on account of some distracting incident. Previous
study is equally manifest in the expository portions; but the method of
delivery as well as the method of preservation must modify our judgment
of the preacher’s exegetical accuracy. Probably many of the
inconsistencies and inexact citations, noticeable in the Homilies, are
due to one or the other of these causes.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="II_1-p5">From an exegetical point of view the Homilies on the Old
Testament rank lowest, those on the Pauline Epistles highest. The
reasons for this are easily discovered. For the exposition of the Old
Testament Chrysostom did not have the necessary equipment, being
ignorant of Hebrew. In explaining the Gospels he fails to discuss the
historical questions with fullness. This was owing no doubt to his
distinct homiletical purpose. For the same reason he passes over most
of the harmonistic questions, or answers them indefinitely. But in
expounding our Lord’s longer discourses the same qualities as an
interpreter which fitted him so well for explaining the Pauline
Epistles enable him to rise to his full eminence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p6">2. In all the Homilies there is apparent a proper
conception of the relation of the Old Testament and the New.
Chrysostom’s treatment of the two parts of revelation agrees in
many respects with the methods now generally accepted in the
subdivision of Exegetical Theology technically termed Biblical
Theology. He recognized the progressive movement; thus holding to the
essential unity of Scripture, but also admitting the incompleteness of
the Old Testament and superiority of the New. The distinction between
the two is never regarded as an antagonism. Indeed some of the severest
utterances in the Homilies is in opposition to the error that denies
the authority of the Old Testament as a revelation from the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ. But the unity of the two parts of Scripture are
not maintained at the expense of the historical sense of the Old
Testament. While Chrysostom finds in the older revelation a prophecy of
Christ who was to come, “he fails not also to point out the moral
aspect of prophecy as a system of teaching rather than prediction, as
preparatory to the advent of Jesus Christ in the flesh, not only by
informing men’s minds, but disciplining their hearts to receive
Him.”<note n="6" id="II_1-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p7"><span class="c11" id="II_1-p7.1">Stephens</span>, pp.
423–4.</p></note> Probably the absence of any polemical purpose against the Jews aided
him in attaining a position more correct than most of some of the
earlier Fathers. His view of the relation of Christ to the law is set
forth in Homily XVI. on Matthew.<note n="7" id="II_1-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p8">See pp. 103, etc. in this volume.</p></note> In his view of inspiration Chrysostom recognized the Divine-human
character of the Scriptures. While he does not formally state his
theory, the method he adopts implies the value of each and every part
of the Bible, the importance of marking the sense of every word. But
the mechanical theory is nowhere suggested: it is in fact opposed by
his statements regarding the variations in the Gospels.<note n="8" id="II_1-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p9">See p. 3, in this volume.</p></note> Indeed no one could be such an expositor as Chrysostom was without an
acceptance alike of the Divine authority and human authorship of the
Scriptures. These not in antithesis, but in synthesis. Denying the
former, there could have been no such power in preaching; ignoring the
latter, there would have been no such care in his comments. This view
of the Bible was the result of his profound and constant study of it.
The same study gave him the

<pb n="xxi" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_xxi.html" id="II_1-Page_xxi" />

wealth
of Scriptural illustration and suggestion so noticeable in his
Homilies. Knowledge of the whole Bible and love of the whole Bible are
manifest everywhere.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="II_1-p10">3. In textual criticism Chrysostom does not afford us
the help that might be expected from the extent of his labors. Origen
is incomparably more useful to the textual critic. Even in citing the
LXX. many inaccuracies occur, and the Hebrew text is ignored, except in
a few cases where doctrinal discussion had arisen.<note n="9" id="II_1-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p11">See, for example, on p. 32, where the pre-eminence
of the LXX. version is asserted, in the discussion of <scripRef passage="Isa. viii. 3" id="II_1-p11.1" parsed="|Isa|8|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.8.3">Isa. viii. 3</scripRef>.</p></note>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p12">As Westcott and Hort have shown,<note n="10" id="II_1-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p13"><span class="c11" id="II_1-p13.1">Westcott and Hort</span>, <i>Greek
Testament</i>, vol. ii. pp. 135–143.</p></note>the Syrian text of the New Testament had become dominant in the Eastern
church about A.D. 350. It held in the time of Chrysostom very much the
same position afterwards allowed to the received text during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Accordingly we find few
indications of any critical investigations of the text, and the
variations from the Syrian text in the Homilies are neither numerous
nor important. Yet the differences from the received text of our day
are worth noticing.<note n="11" id="II_1-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p14">In this volume most of the variations from the
received text are indicated in the additional foot-notes.</p></note> In all such matters, however, there enter several elements of
uncertainty, combining to subtract from the value of the Homilies or
critical purposes.<note n="12" id="II_1-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p15">On the untrustworthiness of patristic citations, see
<span class="c20" id="II_1-p15.1">Scrivener</span>, <i>Introduction to Criticism of New
Testament</i>, 3d Ed., pp. 416–7. The labor bestowed on the
present volume enables the editor to endorse, <i>con amore</i>, the
judgment of Mr. Scrivener.</p></note> In the case of Chrysostom we know that the Homilies were taken down by
others. Hence we are not sure how accurately the preacher made his
citations, how correctly they were reported, nor how much of change has
been made by copyists in the interest of conformity to the text
prevalent at the time of transcription. Quite frequently the same
passage occurs in two forms within the limits of the same Homily. The
labors of Mr. Field on the Greek text of Chrysostom show how much
remains to be done before we can cite this Father as a trustworthy
witness in regard to the minor variations of the New Testament text.
Fortunately Tischendorf, who had access to a very ancient codex of the
Homilies on Matthew,<note n="13" id="II_1-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p16">The codex is of the sixth century
(Wolfenbüttel), designated in Tischendorf’s notes as
Chr<sup>gue</sup>. See <span class="c20" id="II_1-p16.1">Scrivener</span>,
<i>Introduction</i>, etc., p. 419.</p></note>has given the results of his collation in his painstaking way. As this
codex was not included in the <i>apparatus criticus</i> of Mr. Field,
the supplementary value of Tischendorf’s citations is
increased.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="II_1-p17">Some peculiar readings occur in the Homilies on Matthew;
the most remarkable is, however, a reading of <scripRef passage="Luke ix. 31" id="II_1-p17.1" parsed="|Luke|9|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.9.31">Luke ix. 31</scripRef>. In Homily LVI. 3 (p. 346 of this
volume), Chrysostom expressly reads <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="II_1-p17.2">δξαν</span> for <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="II_1-p17.3"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="II_1-p17.4">ἔ</span></span><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="II_1-p17.5">ξοδον</span>, commenting upon the word.
It seems altogether probable that there was no such reading prevalent
in his day, but that the word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="II_1-p17.6">δξ</span>,
which stands immediately before in <scripRef passage="Luke ix. 31" id="II_1-p17.7" parsed="|Luke|9|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.9.31">Luke ix. 31</scripRef>, was accidentally substituted for <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="II_1-p17.8">ἔξοδον</span>. This might happen from a
slip of the memory on the part of Chrysostom, or some scribe might have
made the blunder in an isolated copy used by the preacher. In other
respects Chrysostom is a witness for the prevalence of the Antiochian
or Syrian text, from which our received text has descended. He ignores
the pericope of the woman taken in adultery (<scripRef passage="John vii. 53, viii. 11" id="II_1-p17.9" parsed="|John|7|53|0|0;|John|8|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.53 Bible:John.8.11">John vii. 53, viii. 11</scripRef>), as do all the Greek Fathers before the
eighth century.</p>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p18">The minor variations do not fully appear in the Oxford
translation, owing to the habit of using the text of the Authorized
Version, even when its differences from the text of Chrysostom were
quite obvious. Accordingly the emendations of the Revised Version have
been given, without comment, in the additional foot-notes to this
volume, wherever that Version represents more accurately the readings
in the Homilies.</p>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p19">4. As already intimated, Chrysostom’s ignorance of
Hebrew detracts from his trustworthiness as an Old Testament expositor.
In the New Testament he is much superior. Yet even here he is open to
criticism. Besides an occasional allegorizing comment, he shows much
inaccuracy, sometimes inconsistency, in dealing with the historical
questions that arise in connection with the Gospel History. He seems to
have no taste for the dis

<pb n="xxii" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_xxii.html" id="II_1-Page_xxii" />

cussion of
such questions. Augustin shows far more judgment in his treatment of
these problems. But the ethical purpose probably debarred Chrysostom
from such investigations. As regards the length of our Lord’s
ministry, the vexed question of our Lord’s brethren, the identity
of Mary Magdalene and the woman who was a sinner, etc., we derive
little satisfaction from these Homilies. Occasionally topographical and
archæological topics are referred to in terms that are misleading
or positively erroneous. Hence the Homilies on the Gospels are usually
estimated as less valuable than those on the Epistles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p20">But where the exegesis deals with the human heart, its
motives, its weakness, or with the grace and love of Jesus Christ,
there Chrysostom rises, and remains “the Master in Israel.”
Few have made advances beyond him in commenting upon the parables, the
miracles of healing, the great discourses of our Lord. His sturdy
common sense enabled him to expound the great eschatological discourse
(<scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv, xxv" id="II_1-p20.1">Matt. xxiv, xxv</scripRef>.) in a manner so free from chiliastic
extravagance, that to-day his exposition can be used with little
alteration.</p>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p21">These characteristics of his exegesis fitted Chrysostom
to excel in his exposition of the Epistles. Here there is more of
continuated and logical method than in the Homilies on the Gospels.
Each Epistle he is careful to consider “as a connected whole;
and, in order to impress this on his hearers, he frequently
recapitulates at the beginning of a Homily all the steps by which the
part under consideration has been reached. In his introduction to each
letter he generally makes useful observations on the author, the time,
place, and style of composition, the readers for whom it was intended,
the general character and arrangement of its contents.”<note n="14" id="II_1-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="II_1-p22"><span class="c11" id="II_1-p22.1">Stephens</span>, <i>St.
Chrysostom</i>, p. 425.</p></note> The Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews is accepted in all
the references to that book which occur in the Homilies or other
portions of Scripture.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="II_1-p23">The doctrinal positions of Chrysostom naturally

these are to be judged by the stage of development attained by the
theology of the Eastern Church in the Post-Nicene period.</p>

<p class="c13" id="II_1-p24">The minute attention necessary in editing this volume
has compelled the writer to note the excellence of the great Greek
Father as an exegete. Beginning the task with some prejudice, mainly
due to a knowledge of the inaccuracy of Chrysostom’s citations,
he now gladly pays his humble tribute to the genius of the author,
hoping that students of the volume will be enabled to echo the praises
that for so many centuries have been bestowed upon John of the Golden
Mouth.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.iv-p7"><span class="c11" id="iii.iv-p7.1">It</span> were indeed meet for us not
at all to require<note n="15" id="iii.iv-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p8">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p8.1">μηδ
δεσθαι</span>, “not even to
need,” as below in sec. 2.—R.]</p></note>the aid of the written Word, but to exhibit a life so pure, that the
grace of the Spirit should be instead of books to our souls, and that
as these are inscribed with ink, even so should our hearts be with the
Spirit. But, since we have utterly put away from us this grace, come,
let us at any rate embrace the second best course.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p9">For that the former was better, God hath made
manifest,<note n="16" id="iii.iv-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p10">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p10.1">ἐδλωσεν</span>, “made evident,
showed.” The translator very frequently renders the aorist by the
English perfect. Attention will be called in some instances, where the
sense is affected by such renderings.—R.]</p></note>both by His words, and by His doings. Since unto Noah, and unto
Abraham, and unto his offspring, and unto Job, and unto Moses too, He
discoursed not by writings, but Himself by Himself, finding their mind
pure. But after the whole people of the Hebrews had fallen into the
very pit of wickedness, then and thereafter was a written word, and
tables, and the admonition which is given by these.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p11">And this one may perceive was the case, not of the
saints in the Old Testament only, but also of those in the New. For
neither to the apostles did God give anything in writing, but instead
of written words He promised that He would give them the grace of the
Spirit: for “He,” saith our Lord, “shall bring all
things to your remembrance.”<note n="17" id="iii.iv-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p12"><scripRef passage="John xiv. 26" id="iii.iv-p12.1" parsed="|John|14|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.26">John xiv.

by the Prophet: “I will make a new covenant with you, putting my
laws into their mind, and in their heart I will write them,” and,
“they shall be all taught of God.”<note n="18" id="iii.iv-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p13"><scripRef passage="Jerem. xxxi. 31-33; Is. liv. 13; Heb. viii. 8-11; John vi. 45" id="iii.iv-p13.1" parsed="|Jer|31|31|31|33;|Isa|54|13|0|0;|Heb|8|8|8|11;|John|6|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.31.31-Jer.31.33 Bible:Isa.54.13 Bible:Heb.8.8-Heb.8.11 Bible:John.6.45">Jerem.

received a law “not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of
the heart.”<note n="19" id="iii.iv-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p14"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. iii. 3" id="iii.iv-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.3">2 Cor. iii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p15">But since in process of time they made shipwreck, some
with regard to doctrines, others as to life and manners, there was
again need that they should be put in remembrance by the written
word.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p16">2. Reflect then how great an evil it is for us, who
ought to live so purely as not even to need written words, but to yield
up our hearts, as books, to the Spirit; now that we have lost that
honor, and are come to have need of these, to fail again in duly
employing even this second remedy. For if it be a blame to stand in
need of written words, and not to have brought down on ourselves the
grace of the Spirit; consider how heavy the charge of not choosing to
profit even after this assistance, but rather treating what is written
with neglect, as if it were cast forth without purpose, and at random,
and so bringing down upon ourselves our punishment with increase.<note n="20" id="iii.iv-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p17">[Literally, “the punishment <i>that is</i>
greater.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p18">But that no such effect may ensue, let us

<pb n="2" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_2.html" id="iii.iv-Page_2" />

give strict heed unto the things that are
written; and let us learn how the Old Law was given on the one hand,
how on the other the New Covenant.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p19">3. How then was that law given in time past, and when,
and where? After the destruction of the Egyptians, in the wilderness,
on Mount Sinai, when smoke and fire were rising up out of the mountain,
a trumpet sounding, thunders and lightnings, and Moses entering into
the very depth of the cloud.<note n="21" id="iii.iv-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p20">[Literally, “the very
cloud.”—R.]</p></note> But in the new covenant not so,—neither in a wilderness, nor in a
mountain, nor with smoke and darkness and cloud and tempest; but at the
beginning of the day, in a house, while all were sitting together, with
great quietness, all took place. For to those, being more unreasonable,
and hard to guide, there was need of outward pomp,<note n="22" id="iii.iv-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p21"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p21.1">σωματικ
φαντασα</span>.</p></note>as of a wilderness, a mountain, a smoke, a sound of trumpet, and the
other like things: but they who were of a higher character, and
submissive, and who had risen above mere corporeal imaginations,<note n="23" id="iii.iv-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p22"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p22.1">τν τν
σωμτων
ννοιανεαγγλιον</span>).—R.]</p></note> Yea, for it was removal of punishment, and remission of sins, and
“righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption,”<note n="24" id="iii.iv-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p23">[A reminiscence of <scripRef passage="1 Cor. i. 30" id="iii.iv-p23.1" parsed="|1Cor|1|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.1.30">1 Cor. i. 30</scripRef>.—R.]</p></note>and adoption, and an inheritance of Heaven, and a relationship unto the
Son of God, which he came declaring unto all; to enemies, to the
perverse, to them that were sitting in darkness. What then could ever
be equal to these good tidings? God on earth, man in Heaven; and all
became mingled together, angels joined the choirs of men, men had
fellowship with the angels, and with the other powers above: and one
might see the long war brought to an end, and reconciliation made
between God and our nature,<note n="25" id="iii.iv-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p24">[Literally, “reconciliations of God to our
nature.” The doctrinal point of view is Pauline: God is
reconciled, His anger removed.—R.]</p></note>the devil brought to shame, demons in flight, death destroyed, Paradise
opened, the curse blotted out, sin put out of the way, error driven
off, truth returning, the word of godliness everywhere sown, and
flourishing in its growth, the polity of those above planted on the
earth, those powers in secure intercourse with us, and on earth angels
continually haunting, and hope abundant touching things to come.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p25">Therefore he hath called the history good tidings,
forasmuch as all other things surely are words only without substance;
as, for instance, plenty of wealth, greatness of power, kingdoms, and
glories, and honors, and whatever other things among men are accounted
to be good: but those which are published by the fishermen would be
legitimately and properly called good tidings: not only as being sure
and immoveable blessings, and beyond our deserts, but also as being
given to us with all facility.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p26">For not by laboring and sweating, not by fatigue and
suffering, but merely as being beloved of God, we received what we have
received.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p27">5. And why can it have been, that when there were so
many disciples, two write only from among the apostles, and two from
among their followers? (For one that was a disciple of Paul, and
another of Peter, together with Matthew and John, wrote the Gospels.)
It was because they did nothing for vainglory, but all things for
use.</p>

<pb n="3" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_3.html" id="iii.iv-Page_3" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p28">“What then? Was not one evangelist sufficient to
tell all?” One indeed was sufficient; but if there be four that
write, not at the same times, nor in the same places, neither after
having met together, and conversed one with another, and then they
speak all things as it were out of one mouth, this becomes a very great
demonstration of the truth.<note n="26" id="iii.iv-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p29">[The independence of the Gospels is thus emphasized
by the most competent exegete of the Nicene period. His treatment of
the apparent discrepancies is suggestive.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p30">6. “But the contrary,” it may be said,
“hath come to pass, for in many places they are convicted of
discordance.” Nay, this very thing is a very great evidence of
their truth. For if they had agreed in all things exactly even to time,
and place, and to the very words, none of our enemies would have
believed but that they had met together, and had written what they
wrote by some human compact; because such entire agreement as this
cometh not of simplicity. But now even that discordance which seems to
exist in little matters delivers them from all suspicion, and speaks
clearly in behalf of the character of the writers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p31">But if there be anything touching times or places, which
they have related differently, this nothing<note n="27" id="iii.iv-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p32">[That is, “in nothing,” in no
respect.—R.]</p></note>injures the truth of what they have said. And these things too, so far
as God shall enable us, we will endeavor, as we proceed, to point out;
requiring you, together with what we have mentioned, to observe, that
in the chief heads, those which constitute our life and furnish out<note n="28" id="iii.iv-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p33"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p33.1">συγκροτοσιν</span>.
[Literally, “weld together,” used of organizing a body of
soldiers.—R.]</p></note>our doctrine, nowhere is any of them found to have disagreed, no not
ever so little.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p34">But what are these points? Such as follow: That God
became man, that He wrought miracles, that He was crucified, that He
was buried, that He rose again, that He ascended, that He will judge,
that He hath given commandments tending to salvation, that He hath
brought in a law not contrary to the Old Testament, that He is a Son,
that He is only-begotten, that He is a true Son, that He is of the same
substance with the Father, and as many things as are like these; for
touching these we shall find that there is in them a full
agreement.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p35">And if amongst the miracles they have not all of them
mentioned all, but one these, the other those, let not this trouble
thee. For if on the one hand one had spoken of all, the number of the
rest would have been superfluous; and if again all had written fresh
things, and different one from another, the proof of their agreement
would not have been manifest. For this cause they have both treated of
many in common, and each of them hath also received and declared
something of his own; that, on the one hand, he might not seem
superfluous, and cast on the heap<note n="29" id="iii.iv-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p36"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p36.1">προσεφαι
πλ</span>.</p></note>to no purpose; on the other, he might make our test of the truth of
their affirmations perfect.<note n="30" id="iii.iv-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p37">[“accurate.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p38">7. Now Luke tells us also the cause wherefore he
proceeds to write: “that thou mayest hold,” saith he,
“the certainty of the words wherein thou hast been
instructed;”<note n="31" id="iii.iv-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p39"><scripRef passage="Luke i. 4" id="iii.iv-p39.1" parsed="|Luke|1|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.4">Luke i.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>that is, that being continually reminded thou mayest hold to the
certainty,<note n="32" id="iii.iv-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p40"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p40.1">’Ασφλεια</span>,
“certainty,” seems to be used here first
<i>objectively</i>, as when we say, “a thing is certain,”
then <i>subjectively</i>, as “I am certain of it.”</p></note>and abide in certainty.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p41">But as to John, he hath himself kept silence touching
the cause; yet,<note n="33" id="iii.iv-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p42">[The translator, with the Latin, follows the reading
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p42.1">δ</span>; most <span class="c20" id="iii.iv-p42.2">mss</span>. have
<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p42.3">γρ</span>, which is the more difficult
reading.—R.]</p></note>(as a tradition<note n="34" id="iii.iv-p42.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p43">So St. Irenæus, iii. 11, 1. “John, the
disciple of the Lord, purposing by the publication of a Gospel to take
away the error which Cerinthus had sown among men, and long before him
those who are called Nicolaitans….thus began the instruction of
his Gospel: <i>In the beginning, &amp;c</i>.” See also St. Clem.
of Alex. in Euseb. E. H. vi. 14; St. Jerome, Pref. to Com. on St.
Matth.</p></note>saith, which hath come down to us from the first, even from the
Fathers,) neither did he come to write without purpose; but forasmuch
as it had been the care of the three to dwell upon the account of the
dispensation,<note n="35" id="iii.iv-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p44"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p44.1">οκονομα</span>, <i>i.e</i>.,
our Lord’s assumption of the Manhood. The word is so used
continually by the Fathers.</p></note>and the doctrines of the Godhead were near being left in silence, he,
moved by Christ, then and not till then set himself to compose his
Gospel.<note n="36" id="iii.iv-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p45">[This paraphrase fairly brings out the sense, but is
a very free rendering of the text.—R.]</p></note> And this is manifest both from the history itself, and from the opening
of his Gospel. For he doth not begin like the rest from beneath, but
from above, from the same point, at which he was aiming, and it was
with a view to this that<note n="37" id="iii.iv-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p46">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p46.1">κα δι
τοτο</span>.]</p></note>he composed the whole book. And not in the beginning only, but
throughout all the Gospel, he is more lofty than the rest.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p47">Of Matthew again it is said,<note n="38" id="iii.iv-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p48">Euseb. E. H. iii. 24; St. Jer. de Vir. Ill. 3; Orig.
in Matth. t. iii. 440; St. Iren. iii. 1. But St. Chrysostom seems to be
quoting the words of some other writer besides these.</p></note> that when those who from amongst the Jews had believed came to him, and
besought him to leave to them in writing those same things, which he
had spoken to them by word, he also composed his Gospel in the language
of the Hebrews. And Mark too, in Egypt,<note n="39" id="iii.iv-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p49">Or in Rome, before the death of St. Peter, who
approved the Gospel. So St. Clem. Alex. in Euseb. E. H. ii. 15; St.
Jer. de Vir. Illustr. c. 8. St. Iren. iii. 1, seems rather to agree
with St. Chrysostom. Perhaps they may be reconciled by supposing St.
Mark’s Gospel written at Rome and approved by St. Peter, but not
published until after his death, when St. Mark was in Egypt. See
Massuet’s note on the place in St. Irenæus; and Euseb. ii.
16.</p></note>
is

said to have done this self-same
thing at the entreaty of the disciples.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p50">For this cause then Matthew, as writing to Hebrews,
sought to shew nothing more, than that He was from Abraham, and David;
but Luke, as discoursing to all in general, traces up the account
higher, going on even to Adam. And the one begins with His generation,
because nothing was so soothing to the Jew as to be told that Christ
was the offspring of Abraham and David: the other doth not so, but
mentions many other things, and then proceeds to the genealogy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p51">8. But the harmony between them we will establish, both
by the whole world, which hath received their statements, and by the
very enemies of the truth. For many sects have had birth, since their
time, holding opinions opposed to their words; whereof some have
received all that they have said, while some have cut off from the rest
certain portions of their statements, and so retain them for
themselves.<note n="40" id="iii.iv-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p52">The Arians, <i>e.g.</i> and kindred sects, received
all the Scriptures; the Marcionites, besides rejecting the Old
Testament received only the Gospel of St. Luke, and ten of St.
Paul’s epistles: out of which Tertulian refutes them at large.
The Manichæans rejected the Old Testament and The Acts of the
Apostles in which latter the Montanists agreed with them. This was
besides numerous interpolations which they all alleged in the books
which they did receive. See St. Aug. <scripRef passage="Ep. 237" id="iii.iv-p52.1">Ep. 237</scripRef>.</p></note> But if there were any hostility<note n="41" id="iii.iv-p52.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p53">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p53.1">μχη</span>, the
technical term for “contradiction” when applied to
statements. See <i>Sophocles’ Greek Lexicon of the Roman and
Byzantine periods; sub voce</i>.—R.]</p></note>in their statements, neither would the sects, who maintain the contrary
part, have received all, but only so much as seemed to harmonize with
themselves; nor would those, which have parted off a portion, be
utterly refuted by that portion; so that the very fragments<note n="42" id="iii.iv-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p54"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p54.1">κμματα</span>, Gr.</p></note>cannot be hid, but declare aloud their connexion<note n="43" id="iii.iv-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p55"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p55.1">κμματα</span>, Gr.</p></note>with the whole body. And like as if thou shouldest take any part from
the side of an animal, even in that part thou wouldest find all the
things out of which the whole is composed;—nerves and veins,
bones, arteries, and blood, and a sample, as one might say, of the
whole lump;—so likewise with regard to the Scriptures; in each
portion of what is there stated, one may see the connexion with the
whole clearly appearing. Whereas, if they were in discord, neither
could this have been pointed out, and the doctrine itself had long
since been brought to nought: “for every kingdom,” saith
He, “divided against itself shall not stand.”<note n="44" id="iii.iv-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p56"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 25; Mark iii. 24; Luke xi. 17" id="iii.iv-p56.1" parsed="|Matt|12|25|0|0;|Mark|3|24|0|0;|Luke|11|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.25 Bible:Mark.3.24 Bible:Luke.11.17">Matt. xii.

that it prevailed on these men, engaged as they were in those things
which are more necessary and very urgent, to take no hurt at all from
these little matters.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p57">Now, where each one was abiding, when he wrote, it is
not right for us to affirm very positively.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p58">But that they are not opposed to each other, this we
will endeavor to prove, throughout the whole work. And thou, in
accusing them of disagreement, art doing just the same as if thou wert
to insist upon their using the same words and forms of speech.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p59">9. And I do not yet say, that those likewise who glory
greatly in rhetoric and philosophy, having many of them written many
books touching the same matters, have not merely expressed themselves
differently, but have even spoken in opposition to one another (for it
is one thing to speak differently and another to speak at variance);
none of these things do I say. Far be it from me to frame our defense
from the frenzy of those men, neither am I willing out of falsehood to
make recommendations for the truth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p60">But this I would be glad to inquire: how were the
differing accounts believed? how did they prevail? how was it that,
while saying opposite things, they were admired, were believed, were
celebrated everywhere in the world?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p61">And yet the witnesses of what they said were many, and
many too were the adversaries and enemies thereof. For they did not
write these things in one corner and bury them, but everywhere, by sea
and by land, they unfolded them in the ears of all, and these things
were read in the presence of enemies, even as they are now, and none of
the things which they said offended any one. And very naturally, for it
was a divine power that pervaded all, and made it to prosper with all
men.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p62">10. For if it had not been so, how could the publican,

a reference to Plato’s Republic, when the word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p65.2">πολιτεα</span> is used. Hence
attention is called to the instances where it occurs.—R.]</p></note>or Zeno, or if there be any one else that hath written a polity, or
hath framed laws. For indeed, touching all these, it hath been made
manifest by themselves, that an evil spirit, and some cruel demon at
war with our race, a foe to modesty, and an enemy to good order,
oversetting all things, hath made his voice be heard in their soul.
When, for example, they make their women common to all, and stripping
virgins naked in the Palæstra, bring them into the gaze of men;
and when they establish secret marriages, mingling all things together
and confounding them, and overturning the limits of nature, what else
is there to say? For that these their sayings are all inventions of
devils, and contrary to nature, even nature herself would testify, not
tolerating what we have mentioned; and this, though they write not
amidst persecutions, nor dangers, nor fightings, but in all security
and freedom, and deck it out with many ornaments from many sources. But
these doctrines of the fishermen, chased as they were, scourged and in
jeopardy, both learned and unlearned, both bond and free, both kings
and private soldiers, both barbarians and Greeks, have received with
all good will.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p66">11. And thou canst not say, that it was because these
things were trifling and low, that they were easily to be received by
all men: nay, for these doctrines are far higher than those. For as to
virginity, they never imagined even the name thereof so much as in a
dream, nor yet of voluntary poverty, nor of fasting, nor of any other
of those things that are high.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p67">But they that are of our part not only exterminate lust,
they chastise not only the act, but even an unchaste look, and
insulting language, and disorderly laughter, and dress, and gait, and
clamor, and they carry on their exactness even to the smallest things,
and have filled the whole earth with the plant of virginity. And
touching God too, and the things in heaven, they persuade men to be
wise<note n="47" id="iii.iv-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p68">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p68.1">φιλοσοφεν</span>.
Literally “to philosophize what no one of them was at any time
able even to,” etc. The negatives are repeated in the original
for greater emphasis.—R.]</p></note>with such knowledge as no one of those hath at any time been able so
much as to conceive in his mind. For how could they, who made for gods
images of beasts, and of monsters that crawl on the earth, and of other
things still more vile?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p69">Yet these high doctrines were both accepted and
believed, and they flourish every day and increase; but the others have
passed away, and perished, having disappeared more easily than
spiders’ webs.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p70">And very naturally, for they were demons that published
these things; wherefore besides their uncleanness, their obscurity is
great, and the labor they require greater. For what could be more
ridiculous than that “republic,”<note n="48" id="iii.iv-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p71">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p71.1">πολιτεα</span>.]</p></note>in which, besides what I have mentioned, the philosopher, when he hath
spent lines without number, that he may be able to shew what justice
is, hath over and above this prolixity filled his discourse with much
indistinctness? This, even if it did contain anything profitable, must
needs be very useless for the life of man. For if the husbandman and
the smith, the builder and the pilot, and every one who subsists by the
labor of his hands, is to leave his trade, and his honest toils, and is
to spend such and such a number of years in order to learn what justice
is; before he has learnt he will often times be absolutely destroyed by
hunger, and perish because of this justice, not having learnt anything
else useful to be known, and having ended his life by a cruel
death.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p72">12. But our lessons are not such; rather Christ hath
taught<note n="49" id="iii.iv-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p73">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p73.1">ἐδδαξεν</span>.]</p></note>us what is just, and what is seemly, and what is expedient, and all
virtue in general, comprising it in few and plain words: at one time
saying that, “on two commandments hang the Law and the
Prophets;”<note n="50" id="iii.iv-p73.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p74"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 40" id="iii.iv-p74.1" parsed="|Matt|22|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.40">Matt. xxii.

another time, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
ye also to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.”<note n="51" id="iii.iv-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p75"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 12" id="iii.iv-p75.1" parsed="|Matt|7|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.12">Matt. vii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p76">And these things even to a laborer, and to a servant,
and to a widow woman, and to a very child, and to him that appeareth to
be exceedingly slow of understanding, are all plain to comprehend and
easy to learn. For the lessons of the truth are like this; and the
actual result bears witness thereto. All at least have learned what
things they are to do, and not learned only, but been emulous also of
them; and not in the cities alone nor in the midst of the market
places, but also in the summits of the mountains.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p77">Yea, for there wilt thou see true wisdom<note n="52" id="iii.iv-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p78">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p78.1">φιλοσοφαν</span>=true

be embraced from childhood, like those others, nor making it a law that
the virtuous man must be so many years old, but addressing their
discourse generally to every age. For those lessons are
children’s toys, but these are the truth of things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p81">And as a place for this their commonwealth<note n="55" id="iii.iv-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p82">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p82.1">πολιτεα</span>, in its proper

thereof, and as lawgiver of the statutes there set; as indeed was their
duty. And the rewards in their commonwealth<note n="56" id="iii.iv-p82.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p83">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p83.1">πολιτεα</span>, in its proper

hall, nor statues of brass, these cold and ordinary things, but a life
which hath no end, and to become children of God, to join the
angels’ choir, and to stand by the royal throne, and to be always
with Christ. And the popular guides of this commonwealth<note n="57" id="iii.iv-p83.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p84">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p84.1">πολιτεα</span>, in its proper

for a short time, but such as are now living for ever. Therefore even
after their death they may possibly do the greatest good to the
governed.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p85">This republic<note n="58" id="iii.iv-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p86">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p86.1">πολιτεα</span>, in its proper

Wherefore also their captain is no one of men, nor of angels, but God
Himself. And the armor too of these warriors suits the nature of the
warfare, for it is not formed of hides and steel, but of truth and of
righteousness, and faith, and all true love of wisdom.<note n="59" id="iii.iv-p86.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p87">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p87.1">φιλοσοφα</span>.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p88">13. Since then the aforesaid republic<note n="60" id="iii.iv-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p89">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p89.1">πολιτεα</span>, in its proper
case.]</p></note>is both the subject on which this book was written, and it is now
proposed for us to speak thereof, let us give careful heed to Matthew,
discoursing plainly concerning this: for what he saith is not his own,
but all Christ’s, who hath made the laws of this city.<note n="61" id="iii.iv-p89.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p90">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p90.1">πολιτεα</span>, in its proper
case.]</p></note> Let us give heed, I say, that we may be capable of enrolment therein,
and of shining forth among those that have already become citizens
thereof, and are awaiting those incorruptible crowns. To many, however,
this discourse seems to be easy, while the prophetic writings are
difficult. But this again is the view of men who know not the depth of
the thoughts laid up therein. Wherefore I entreat you to follow us with
much diligence, so as to enter into the very ocean of the things
written, with Christ for our guide at this our entering in.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p91">But in order that the word may be the more easy to
learn, we pray and entreat you, as we have done also with respect to
the other Scriptures, to take up beforehand that portion of the
Scripture which we may be going to explain, that your reading may
prepare the way for your understanding (as also was the case with the
eunuch<note n="62" id="iii.iv-p91.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p92"><scripRef passage="Acts viii. 28" id="iii.iv-p92.1" parsed="|Acts|8|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.28">Acts viii.
28</scripRef>.</p></note>), and so may greatly facilitate our task.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p93">14. And this because<note n="63" id="iii.iv-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p94">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p94.1">Κα
γρ</span>.]</p></note>the questions are many and frequent. See, for instance, at once in the
beginning of his Gospel, how many difficulties might be raised one
after the other. As first, wherefore the genealogy of Joseph is traced,
who was not father of Christ. Secondly, whence may it be made manifest
that He derives His origin from David, while the forefathers of Mary,
who bare Him, are not known, for the Virgin’s genealogy is not
traced? Thirdly, on what account Joseph’s genealogy is traced,
when he had nothing to do with the birth; while with regard to the
Virgin, who was the very mother, it is not shown of what fathers, or
grandfathers, or ancestors, she is sprung.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p95">And along with these things, this is also worth inquiry,
wherefore it can be, that, when tracing the genealogy through the men,
he hath mentioned women also; and why since he determined upon doing
this, he yet did not mention them all, but passing over the more
eminent, such as Sarah, Rebecca, and as many as are like them, he hath
brought forward only them that are famed for some bad thing; as, for
instance, if any was a harlot, or an adulteress, or a mother by an
unlawful marriage, if any was a stranger or barbarian. For he hath made
mention of the wife of Uriah, and of Thamar, and of Rahab, and of Ruth,
of whom one was of a strange race, another an harlot, another was
defiled by her near kinsman, and with him not in the form of marriage,
but by a stolen intercourse, when she had put on herself the mask of an
harlot; and touching the wife of Uriah no one is ignorant, by reason of
the notoriety of the crime. And yet the evangelist hath passed by all
the rest, and inserted in the genealogy these alone. Whereas, if women
were to be mentioned, all ought to be so; if not all but some, then
those famed in the way of virtue, not for evil deeds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p96">See you how much care is required of us straightway in
the first beginning? and yet the beginning seems to be plainer than the
rest; to many perhaps even superfluous, as being a mere numbering of
names.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p97">After this, another point again is worth inquiry;
wherefore he hath omitted three kings. For if, because they were
exceeding ungodly, he therefore passed by their names in silence,
neither should he have mentioned the others, that were like them.</p>

<pb n="7" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_7.html" id="iii.iv-Page_7" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p98">And this again<note n="64" id="iii.iv-p98.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p99">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p99.1">Κα γρ
κα τοτο</span>.]</p></note>is another question; why, after having spoken of fourteen generations,
he hath not in the third division maintained the number.<note n="65" id="iii.iv-p99.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p100">[See Homily iv., where this question is
discussed.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p101">And wherefore Luke hath made mention of other names, and
not only not all of them the same, but also many more of them, while
Matthew hath both fewer and different, though he too hath ended with
Joseph, with whom Luke likewise concluded.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p102">Ye see how much wakeful attention is needed on our part,
not only for explanation, but even that we may learn what things we
have to explain. For neither is this a little matter, to be able to
find out the difficulties; there being also this other hard point, how
Elizabeth, who was of the Levitical tribe, was kinswoman to Mary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p103">15. But that we may not overload your memory, by
stringing many things together, here let us stay our discourse for a
time. For it is enough for you in order that ye be thoroughly roused,
that you learn<note n="66" id="iii.iv-p103.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p104">[Literally, “and learn.”—R.]</p></note>the questions only. But if ye long for<note n="67" id="iii.iv-p104.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p105"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p105.1">ἐρτε</span></p></note>their solution also, this again depends on yourselves, before we speak.
For if I see you thoroughly awakened, and longing to learn, I will
endeavor to add the solution also; but if gaping and not attending, I
will conceal both the difficulties, and their solution, in obedience to
a divine law. For, saith He, “Give not the holy things to the
dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them
under their feet.”<note n="68" id="iii.iv-p105.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p106"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 6" id="iii.iv-p106.1" parsed="|Matt|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.6">Matt. vii.
6</scripRef>. [The citation is not,
however, verbally accurate.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p107">But who is he that tramples them under foot? He that
doth not account these things precious, and venerable. And who, it may
be asked, is so wretched as not to esteem these things venerable, and
more precious than all? He who doth not bestow on them so much leisure
as on the harlot women in the theatres of Satan. For there the
multitude pass the whole day, and give up not a few of their domestic
concerns for the sake of this unseasonable employment, and they retain
with exactness whatever they have heard, and this though it be to the
injury of their souls, that they keep it. But here, where God is
speaking, they will not bear to tarry even a little time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p108">Therefore, let me warn you, we have nothing in common
with Heaven, but our citizenship<note n="69" id="iii.iv-p108.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p109">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p109.1">πολιτεα</span> ]</p></note>goes no further than words. And yet because of this, God hath
threatened even hell, not in order to cast us therein, but that He
might persuade us to flee this grievous tyranny. But we do the
opposite, and run each day the way that leads thither, and while God is
commanding us not only to hear, but also to do what He saith, we do not
submit so much as to hearken.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p110">When then, I pray thee, are we to do what is commanded,
and to put our hand to the works, if we do not endure so much as to
hear the words that relate to them, but are impatient and restless
about the time we stay here, although it be exceedingly short?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p111">16. And besides, when we are talking of indifferent
matters, if we see those that are in company do not attend, we call
what they do an insult; but do we consider that we are provoking God,
if, while He is discoursing of such things as these, we despise what is
said, and look another way?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p112">Why, he that is grown old, and hath travelled over much
country, reports to us with all exactness the number of stadia, and the
situations of cities, their plans, and their harbors and markets; but
we ourselves know not even how far we are from the city that is in
Heaven. For surely we should have endeavored to shorten the space, had
we known the distance. That city being not only as far from us as
Heaven is from the earth, but even much farther, if we be negligent;
like as, on the other hand, if we do our best,<note n="70" id="iii.iv-p112.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p113">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p113.1">σπουδζωμεν</span>;
the verb is rendered “endeavor” in the preceding
sentence.—R.]</p></note>even in one instant we shall come to the gates thereof. For not by
local space, but by moral disposition, are these distances defined.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p114">But thou knowest exactly the affairs of the world, as
well new as old, and such too as are quite ancient; thou canst number
the princes under whom thou hast served in time past, and the ruler of
the games, and them that gained the prize, and the leaders of armies,
matters that are of no concern to thee; but who hath become ruler in
this city, the first or the second or the third, and for how long, each
of them; and what each hath accomplished, and brought to pass, thou
hast not imagined even as in a dream. And the laws that are set in this
city thou wilt not endure to hear, nor attend to them, even when others
tell thee of them. How then, I pray thee, dost thou expect to obtain
the blessings that are promised, when thou dost not even attend to what
is said?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p115">17. But though never before, now, at any rate, let us do
this. Yea, for we<note n="71" id="iii.iv-p115.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.iv-p116">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.iv-p116.1">Κα
γρ</span>.]</p></note>are on the point of entering into a city (if God permit) of gold, and
more precious than any gold.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p117">Let us then mark her foundations, her

<pb n="8" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_8.html" id="iii.iv-Page_8" />

gates consisting of sapphires and pearls; for
indeed we have in Matthew an excellent guide. For through his gate we
shall now enter in, and much diligence is required on our part. For
should He see any one not attentive, He casts him out of the city.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p118">Yes, for the city is most kingly and glorious; not as
the cities with us, divided into a market-place, and the royal courts;
for there all is the court of the King. Let us open therefore the gates
of our mind, let us open our ears, and with great trembling, when on
the point of setting foot on the threshold, let us worship the King
that is therein. For indeed the first approach hath power straightway
to confound the beholder.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p119">For the present we find the gates closed; but when we
see them thrown open (for this is the solution of the difficulties),
then we shall perceive the greatness of the splendor within. For there
also, leading thee with the eyes of the Spirit, is one who offers to
show thee all, even this Publican; where the King sitteth, and who of
His host stand by Him; where are the angels, where the archangels; and
what place is set apart for the new citizens in this city, and what
kind of way it is that leads thither, and what manner of portion they
have received, who first were citizens therein, and those next after
them, and such as followed these. And how many are the orders of these
tribes, how many those of the senate, how many the distinctions of
dignity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p120">Let us not therefore with noise or tumult enter in, but
with a mystical silence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p121">For if in a theatre, when a great silence hath been
made, then the letters of the king are read, much more in this city
must all be composed, and stand with soul and ear erect. For it is not
the letters of any earthly master, but of the Lord of angels, which are
on the point of being read.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.iv-p122">If we would order ourselves on this wise, the grace
itself of the Spirit will lead us in great perfection, and we shall
arrive at the very royal throne, and attain to all the good things, by
the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory and might, together with the Father and the Holy Ghost, now and
always, even for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

feel no satiety at all; nay, thou wouldest not prefer either drink or

more this. For consider what a thing it is to hear, how on the one side

with trembling, setting foot straightway within the vestibule
itself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p18">2. But what is this vestibule? “The book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p19">“What sayest thou? Didst thou not promise to
discourse of the Only-begotten Son of God, and dost thou make mention
of David, a man born after a thousand generations, and say that he is
both father and ancestor?” Stay, seek not to learn all at once,
but gently and by little and little. Why, it is in the vestibule that
thou art standing, by the very porch; why then dost thou hasten towards
the inner shrine? As yet thou hast not well marked all without. For
neither for a while do I declare unto thee that other generation: or
rather not even this which cometh after, for it is unutterable, and
unspeakable. And before me the Prophet Esaias hath told thee this;
where<note n="79" id="iii.v-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p20">[Literally, “for.”]</p></note>when proclaiming His passion, and His great care for the world, and
admiring who He was, and what He became, and whither He descended, he

may be possible for us, having received the grace of the Spirit. For
not even this may any one set forth altogether plainly, forasmuch as
this too is most awful. Think not, therefore, it is of small things
thou art hearing, when thou hearest of this birth, but rouse up thy
mind, and straightway tremble, being told that God hath come upon
earth. For so marvellous was this, and beyond expectation, that because
of these things the very angels formed a choir, and in behalf of the
world offered up their praise for them, and the prophets from the first
were amazed at this, that “He was seen upon earth, and conversed

there are those women, whom we have lately mentioned.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p25">3. Hearing these things, arise, and surmise nothing low:
but even because of this very thing most of all shouldest thou
marvel,<note n="83" id="iii.v-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p26">[Chrysostom uses the imperative: “Because of
this very thing especially marvel,” etc.—R.]</p></note>that being Son of the Unoriginate God, and His true Son, He suffered
Himself to be called also Son of David, that He might make

<pb n="10" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_10.html" id="iii.v-Page_10" />

thee Son of God. He suffered a slave to be
father to Him, that He might make the Lord Father to thee a slave.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p27">Seest thou at once from the beginning of what nature are
the Gospels? If thou doubt concerning the things that pertain to thee,
from what belongs to Him believe these also. For it is far more
difficult, judging by human reason, for God to become man, than for a
man to be declared a Son of God. When therefore thou art told that the
Son of God is Son of David and of Abraham, doubt not any more that thou
too, the son of Adam, shall be son of God. For not at random, nor in
vain did He abase Himself so greatly, only He was minded to exalt us.
Thus He was born after the flesh, that thou mightest be born after the
Spirit; He was born of a woman, that thou mightest cease to be the son
of a woman.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p28">Wherefore the birth was twofold, both made like unto us,
and also surpassing ours. For to be born of a woman indeed was our lot,
but “to be born not of blood, nor of the will of flesh, nor of
man,” but of the Holy Ghost,<note n="84" id="iii.v-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p29"><scripRef passage="John i. 13" id="iii.v-p29.1" parsed="|John|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.13">John i.
13</scripRef>.</p></note>was to proclaim beforehand the birth surpassing us, the birth to come,
which He was about freely to give us of the Spirit. And everything else
too was like this. Thus His baptism also was of the same kind, for it
partook of the old, and it partook also of the new. To be baptized by
the prophet marked the old, but the coming down of the Spirit shadowed
out the new. And like as though any one were to place himself in the
space between any two persons that were standing apart, and stretching
forth both his hands were to lay hold on either side, and tie them
together; even so hath He done, joining the old covenant with the new,
God’s nature with man’s, the things that are His with
ours.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p30">Seest thou the flashing brightness<note n="85" id="iii.v-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p31"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p31.1">ἀστραπν</span>. [Used of a flash of
lightning, or dazzling brightness.—R.]</p></note>of the city, with how great a splendor it hath dazzled thee from the
very beginning? how it hath straightway shown the King in thine own
form; as though in a camp? For neither there doth the king always
appear bearing his proper dignity, but laying aside the purple and the
diadem, he often disguises himself in the garb of a common soldier. But
there it is, lest by being known he should draw the enemy upon himself;
but here on the contrary, lest, if He were known, He should cause the
enemy to fly from the conflict with Him, and lest He should confound
all His own people: for His purpose was to save, not to dismay.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p32">4. For this reason he hath also straightway called Him
by this title, naming Him Jesus. For this name, Jesus, is not Greek,
but in the Hebrew language it is thus called Jesus; which is, when
interpreted into the Greek tongue, “A Saviour.” And He is
called a Saviour, from His saving His people.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p33">Seest thou how he hath given wings to the hearer, at
once speaking things familiar, and at the same time by these indicating
to us things beyond all hope? I mean that<note n="86" id="iii.v-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p34">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p34.1">κα
γρ</span>.]</p></note>both these names were well known to the Jews. For, because the things
that were to happen were beyond expectation, the types even of the
names went before, in order that from the very first all the unsettling
power of novelty might be taken away. Thus he is called Jesus, who
after Moses brought the people into the land of promise. Hast thou seen
the type? Behold the truth. That led into the land of promise, this
into heaven, and to the good things in the heavens; that, after Moses
was dead, this after the law had ceased; that as a leader, this as a
King.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p35">However, lest having heard the word Jesus, thou
shouldest by reason of the identity of the name be perplexed, he hath
added, “Jesus Christ, Son of David.” But that other was not
of David, but of another tribe.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p36">5. But wherefore doth he call it a “book of the
generation of Jesus Christ,” while yet this book hath not the
birth only, but the whole dispensation? Because this is the sum of the
whole dispensation, and is made an origin and root of all our
blessings. As then Moses calleth it the book of heaven and earth,<note n="87" id="iii.v-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p37"><scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 4" id="iii.v-p37.1" parsed="|Gen|2|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.4">Gen. ii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>although he hath not discoursed of heaven and earth only, but also of
all things that are in the midst thereof; so also this man hath named
his book from that which is the sum of all the great things done. For
that which teems with astonishment, and is beyond hope and all
expectation, is that God should become man. But this having come to
pass, all afterwards follows in reasonable consequence.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p38">6. But wherefore did he not say, “the Son of
Abraham,” and then “the Son of David?” It is not, as
some suppose, that he means to proceed upward from the lower point,
since then he would have done the same as Luke, but now he doth the
contrary. Why then hath he made mention of David? The man was in the
mouths of all, both from his distinction, and from the time, for he had
not been so very long since dead, like Abraham. And though God made
promises to both, yet the one, as old, was passed over in silence,

<pb n="11" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_11.html" id="iii.v-Page_11" />

while the other, as fresh and
recent, was repeated of all. Themselves, for instance, say, “Doth
not Christ come of the seed of David, and out of Bethlehem, the town
where David was?”<note n="88" id="iii.v-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p39"><scripRef passage="John vii. 42" id="iii.v-p39.1" parsed="|John|7|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.42">John vii.
42</scripRef>.</p></note> And no man called Him Son of Abraham, but all Son of David; and that
because this last was more in the recollection of all, both on account
of the time, as I have already said, and because of his royalty. On
this principle again all the kings whom they had in honor after his
time were named from him, both by the people themselves and by God. For
both Ezekiel<note n="89" id="iii.v-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p40"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xxxiv. 23, 24; xxxvii. 24, 25; Jer. xxx. 9; Hos. iii. 5" id="iii.v-p40.1" parsed="|Ezek|34|23|34|24;|Ezek|37|24|37|25;|Jer|30|9|0|0;|Hos|3|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.34.23-Ezek.34.24 Bible:Ezek.37.24-Ezek.37.25 Bible:Jer.30.9 Bible:Hos.3.5">Ezek.

not meaning him that was dead, but them who were emulating his virtue.
And to Hezekiah He saith, “I will defend this city, for mine own
sake and for my servant David’s sake.”<note n="90" id="iii.v-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p41"><scripRef passage="2 Kings xix. 34" id="iii.v-p41.1" parsed="|2Kgs|19|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.19.34">2 Kings

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p43">On account of this he makes the beginning at once from
him who was more known, and then runs up to his father; accounting it
superfluous, as far as regards the Jews, to carry the genealogy higher
up. For these were principally the persons held in admiration; the one
as a prophet and a king, the other as a patriarch and a prophet.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p44">7. “But<note n="92" id="iii.v-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p45">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p45.1">Κα</span>.]</p></note>whence is it manifest that He is of David?” one may say. For if
He was not sprung of a man, but from a woman only, and the Virgin hath
not her genealogy traced, how shall we know that He was of
David’s race? Thus, there are two things inquired; both why His
mother’s genealogy is not recited, and wherefore it can be that
Joseph is mentioned by them, who hath no part in the birth: since the
latter seems to be superfluous, and the former a defect.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p46">Of which then is it necessary to speak first? How the
Virgin is of David. How then shall we know that she is of David?
Hearken unto God, telling Gabriel to go unto “a virgin betrothed
to a man (whose name was Joseph), of the house and lineage of
David.”<note n="93" id="iii.v-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p47"><scripRef passage="Luke i. 27" id="iii.v-p47.1" parsed="|Luke|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.27">Luke i.

Testament. But the citation here is probably made with
freedom.—R.]</p></note> What now wouldest thou have plainer than this, when thou hast heard
that the Virgin was of the house and lineage of David?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p48">Hence it is evident that Joseph also was of the same.
Yes, for there was a law, which bade that it should not be lawful to
take a wife from any other stock, but from the same tribe. And the
patriarch Jacob also foretold that He should arise out of the tribe of
Judah, saying on this wise: “there shall not fail a ruler out of
Judah, nor a governor out of his loins, until He come for whom it is
appointed, and He is the expectation of the Gentiles.”<note n="94" id="iii.v-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p49"><scripRef passage="Gen. xlix. 10" id="iii.v-p49.1" parsed="|Gen|49|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.49.10">Gen. xlix.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p50">“Well; this prophecy doth indeed make it clear
that He was of the tribe of Judah, but not also that He was of the
family of David. Was there then in the tribe of Judah one family only,
even that of David, or were there not also many others? And might it
not happen for one to be of the tribe of Judah, but not also of the
family of David?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p51">Nay, lest thou shouldest say this, the evangelist hath
removed this suspicion of thine, by saying, that He was “of the
house and lineage of David.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p52">And if thou wish to learn this from another reason
besides, neither shall we be at a loss for another proof. For not only
was it not allowed to take a wife out of another tribe, but not even
from another lineage, that is, from another kindred. So that if either
we connect with the Virgin the words, “of the house and lineage
of David,” what hath been said stands good; or if with Joseph, by
that fact this also is proved. For if Joseph was of the house and
lineage of David, he would not have taken his wife from another than
that whence he himself was sprung.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p53">“What then,” one may say, “if he
transgressed the law?” Why, for this cause he hath by
anticipation testified that Joseph was righteous, on purpose that thou
mightest not say this, but having been told his virtue, mightest be
sure also that he would not have transgressed the law. For he who was
so benevolent, and free from passion, as not to wish, even when urged
by suspicion, to attempt inflicting punishment on the Virgin, how
should he have transgressed the law for lust? he that showed wisdom and
self-restraint beyond the law (for to put her away, and that privily,
was to act with self-restraint beyond the law), how should he have done
anything contrary to the law; and this when there was no cause to urge
him?<note n="95" id="iii.v-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p54">[The labored argument here suggests that Chrysostom
was not sure of his exegetical position. In <scripRef passage="Luke i. 27" id="iii.v-p54.1" parsed="|Luke|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.27">Luke i. 27</scripRef>, the phrase “of the house of
David” is most naturally joined with “Joseph,” and so
Chrysostom himself implies.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p55">8. Now that the Virgin was of the race of David is
indeed from these things evident; but wherefore he gave not her
genealogy, but Joseph’s, requires explanation. For what cause was
it then? It was not the law among the Jews that the genealogy of women
should

<pb n="12" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_12.html" id="iii.v-Page_12" />

be traced. In order then
that he might keep the custom, and not seem to be making
alterations<note n="96" id="iii.v-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p56"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p56.1">παραχαρττειν</span>.
[This word is the technical one for counterfeiting or
forging.—R.]</p></note>from the beginning, and yet might make the Virgin known to us, for this
cause he hath passed over her ancestors in silence, and traced the
genealogy of Joseph. For if he had done this with respect to the
Virgin, he would have seemed to be introducing novelties; and if he had
passed over Joseph in silence, we should not have known the
Virgin’s forefathers. In order therefore that we might learn,
touching Mary, who she was, and of what origin, and that the laws might
remain undisturbed, he hath traced the genealogy of her espoused
husband, and shown him to be of the house of David. For when this hath
been clearly proved, that other fact is demonstrated with it, namely,
that the Virgin likewise is sprung from thence, by reason that this
righteous man, even as I have already said, would not have endured to
take a wife from another race.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p57">There is also another reason, which one might mention,
of a more mystical nature, because of which the Virgin’s
forefathers were passed over in silence; but this it were not
seasonable now to declare, because so much has been already said.<note n="97" id="iii.v-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p58">See Hom. iii. sec. 1.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p59">9. Wherefore let us stay at this point our discourse
concerning the questions, and in the meanwhile let us retain with
accuracy what hath been revealed to us; as, for instance, why he
mentioned David first; wherefore he called the book, “a book of
the generation;” on what account he said, “of Jesus
Christ;” how the birth is common and not common; whence it was
that Mary was shown to be from David; and wherefore Joseph’s
genealogy is traced, while her ancestors are passed over in
silence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p60">For if ye retain these things, ye will the more
encourage us with respect to what is to come; but if ye reject and cast
them from your mind, we shall be the more backward as to the rest. Just
as no husbandman would care to pay attention to a soil which had
destroyed the former seed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p61">Wherefore I entreat you to revolve these things. For
from taking thought concerning such matters, there springs in the soul
some great good, tending unto salvation. For by these meditations we
shall be able to please God Himself; and our mouths will be pure from
insults, and filthy talking, and reviling, while they are exercising
themselves in spiritual sayings; and we shall be formidable to the
devils, while arming our tongue with such words; and we shall draw unto
ourselves God’s grace the more, and it will render our eye more
piercing. For indeed both eyes and mouth and hearing He set in us to
this intent, that all our members may serve Him, that we may speak His
words, and do His deeds, that we may sing unto Him continual hymns,
that we may offer up sacrifices of thanksgiving,<note n="98" id="iii.v-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p62"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p62.1">εχαριστα</span>.</p></note>and by these may thoroughly purify our consciences.</p>

when they are in clear air, and in a meadow, and in fountains and
gardens, they become more quicksighted and more healthy? Like this is
the soul’s eye also, for should it feed in the meadow of
spiritual oracles, it will be clear and piercing, and quick of sight;
but should it depart into the smoke of the things of this life, it will
weep without end, and wail both now and hereafter. For indeed the
things of this life are like smoke. On this account also one hath said,
“My days have failed like smoke.”<note n="100" id="iii.v-p64.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p65"><scripRef passage="Ps. cii. 3" id="iii.v-p65.1" parsed="|Ps|2|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.3">Ps. cii.

unsubstantial nature, but I would say that we should take what is said,
not in this sense alone, but also as to their turbid character.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p66">For nothing doth so hurt and dim the eye of the soul as
the crowd of worldly anxieties and the swarm of desires. For these are
the wood that feedeth this smoke. And as fire, when it lays hold of any
damp and saturated fuel, kindles much smoke; so likewise this desire,
so vehement and burning, when it lays hold of a soul that is (so to
speak) damp and dissolute, produces also in its way abundance of smoke.
For this cause there is need of the dew of the Spirit, and of that air,
that it may extinguish the fire, and scatter the smoke, and give wings
to our thoughts. For it cannot, it cannot be that one weighed down with
so great evils should soar up to heaven; it is well if being without
impediment<note n="101" id="iii.v-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p67">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p67.1">εζνου</span>, “well-girded,”
then figuratively, “unencumbered.”—R.]</p></note>we can cleave our way thither; or rather it is not possible even so,
unless we obtain the wing of the Spirit.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p68">Now if there be need both of an unencum

bered mind, and of spiritual grace, that we may
mount up to that height; what if there be none of these things, but we
draw to ourselves whatever is opposite to them, even a satanical
weight? how shall we be able to soar upwards, when dragged down by so
great a load? For indeed, should any one attempt to weigh our words as
it were in just balances; in ten thousand talents of worldly talk he
will scarcely find an hundred pence of spiritual words, or rather, I
should say, not even ten farthings. Is it not then a disgrace, and an
extreme mockery, that if we have a servant, we make use of him for the
most part in things necessary, but being possessed of a tongue, we do
not deal with our member so well even as with a slave, but on the
contrary make use of it for things unprofitable, and mere
makeweights?<note n="102" id="iii.v-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p69">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p69.1">παρλκοντα</span>

advantageous to us. For if the things that we spoke were profitable to
us, they would assuredly be also pleasing to God. But as it is,
whatever the devil may suggest, we speak it all, now laughing, and now
speaking wittily; now cursing and insulting, and now swearing, lying,
and taking false oaths; now murmuring, and now making vain babblings,
and talking trifles more than old wives; uttering all things that are
of no concern to us.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p71">For, tell me, who of you that stand here, if he were
required, could repeat one Psalm, or any other portion of the divine
Scriptures? There is not one.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p72">And it is not this only that is the grievous thing, but
that while ye are become so backward with respect to things spiritual,
yet in regard of what belongs to Satan ye are more vehement than fire.
Thus should any one be minded to ask of you songs of devils and impure
effeminate melodies, he will find many that know these perfectly, and
repeat them with much pleasure.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p73">10. But what is the answer to these charges? “I am
not,” you will say, “one of the monks, but I have both a
wife and children, and the care of a household.” Why, this is
what hath ruined all, your supposing that the reading of the divine
Scriptures appertains to those only, when ye need it much more than
they. For they that dwell in the world,<note n="104" id="iii.v-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p74">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.v-p74.1">ἐν μσ
στρεφομνοι</span>
.]</p></note>and each day receive wounds, these have most need of medicines. So that
it is far worse than not reading, to account the thing even
“superfluous:” for these are the words of diabolical
invention. Hear ye not Paul saying, “that all these things are
written for our admonition”?<note n="105" id="iii.v-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p75"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 11" id="iii.v-p75.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.11">1 Cor. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p76">And thou, if thou hadst to take up a Gospel, wouldest
not choose to do so with hands unwashed; but the things that are laid
up within it, dost thou not think to be highly necessary? It is because
of this, that all things are turned upside down.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p77">For if thou wouldest learn how great is the profit of
the Scriptures, examine thyself, what thou becomest by hearing Psalms,
and what by listening to a song of Satan; and how thou art disposed
when staying in a Church, and how when sitting in a theatre; and thou
wilt see that great is the difference between this soul and that,
although both be one. Therefore Paul said, “Evil communications
corrupt good manners.”<note n="106" id="iii.v-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p78"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 33" id="iii.v-p78.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.33">1 Cor. xv.

charms from the Spirit. Yes, for this it is whereby we excel the
irrational creatures, since with respect to all other things, we are
even exceedingly inferior to them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p79">This is a soul’s food, this its ornament, this its
security; even as not to hear is famine and wasting; for “I will
give them,” saith He, “not a famine of bread, nor a thirst
of water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord.”<note n="107" id="iii.v-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p80"><scripRef passage="Amos viii. 11" id="iii.v-p80.1" parsed="|Amos|8|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.8.11">Amos viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p81">What then can be more wretched? when the very evil,
which God threatens in the way of punishment, this thou art drawing
upon thine head of thine own accord, bringing into thy soul a sort of
grievous famine, and making it the feeblest thing in the world? For it
is its nature both to be wasted and to be saved by words. Yea, this
leads it on to anger; and the same kind of thing again makes it meek: a
filthy expression is wont to kindle it to lust, and it is trained to
temperance by speech full of gravity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p82">But if a word merely have such great power, tell me, how
is it thou dost despise the Scriptures? And if an admonition can do
such great things, far more when the admonitions are with the Spirit.
Yes, for a word from the divine Scriptures, made to sound in the ear,
doth more than fire soften the hardened soul, and renders it fit for
all good things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p83">11. In this way too did Paul, when he had found the
Corinthians puffed up and inflamed, compose them, and make them more
considerate. For they were priding themselves on those very things,
touching which they ought to have been ashamed, and to have hid their
face. But after they had received the letter, hear the change in them,
of which the Teacher himself hath borne witness for them, saying on
this wise: for “this very thing,

<pb n="14" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_14.html" id="iii.v-Page_14" />

that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what
carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea,
what indignation, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge.”<note n="108" id="iii.v-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p84">[<scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 11" id="iii.v-p84.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.11">2 Cor.

text, so far as these phrases are concerned. Like most patristic
authors, this great Homilist was quite free in his method of citing
Scripture.—R.]</p></note> In this way do we bring to order servants and children, wives, and
friends, and make our enemies friends.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p85">In this way the great men too, they that were dear to
God, became better. David, for instance, after his sin, when he had had
the benefit of certain words, then it was that he came unto that most
excellent repentance; and the apostles also by this mean became what
they did become, and drew after them the whole world.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p86">“And what is the profit,” one may say,
“when any one hears, but doeth not what is said?” No little
will the profit be even from hearing. For he will go on to condemn
himself,<note n="109" id="iii.v-p86.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.v-p87">[Literally, “will condemn
himself.”—R.]</p></note>and to groan inwardly, and will come in time also to do the things that
are spoken of. But he that doth not even know that he hath sinned, when
will he cease from his negligence? when will he condemn himself?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p88">Let us not therefore despise the hearing of the divine
Scriptures. For this is of Satan’s devising; not suffering us to
see the treasure, lest we should gain the riches. Therefore he saith
that the hearing the divine laws is nothing, lest he should see us from
the hearing acquiring the practice also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.v-p89">Knowing then this his evil art, let us fortify ourselves
against him on all sides, that being fenced with this armor, we may
both abide unconquered ourselves, and smite him on the head: and thus,
having crowned ourselves with the glorious wreaths of victory, we may
attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

then that is now required? Why Joseph’s genealogy is traced, who

it is necessary to mention likewise the other, that which is more

Mary, and her delivery, was kept in secret from the prince of this
world, as was also the Lord’s death; three most notable
mysteries, yet done in Secret of God.” [See <i>Ante-Nicene
Fathers</i>, Vol. I., p. 57. The Greek given in this note is from the
“briefer” form of the Ignatian Epistles. But the
“longer” form differs very little, and the Syriac version,
brief as it is, contains this sentence.—R.] And Origen, 6th
Homily on St. Luke, says, “It has been well written in one of the
epistles of a certain martyr, I mean Ignatius, the next Bishop of
Antioch after the blessed Peter, him who fought with wild beasts in the
persecution at Rome, ‘Now the virginity of Mary was kept in
secret from the prince of this world.’ It was concealed because
of Joseph, because of her espousals, because she was supposed to have a
husband. For, had she had no spouse or supposed husband, it could not
have been concealed from the prince of this world. For presently the
thought would have silently occurred to the evil one, ‘How is she
with child, who knoweth not a man? This conception must be divine, it
must be something higher than human nature.’ On the contrary, our
Saviour had purposed that the devil should be ignorant of his
Œconomy and Incarnation: for which cause He both in His birth
concealed the same, and commanded His disciples afterwards that they
should not make Him known. Also when tempted by the devil in person, He
no where owned Himself Son of God.” Origen then quotes <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 6-8" id="iii.vi-p7.3" parsed="|1Cor|2|6|2|8" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.6-1Cor.2.8">1 Cor. ii.
6–8</scripRef>, to the same effect. And in answer to the objection, How the
devils which were from time to time cast out knew Him to be the Son of
God, he suggests that it might be owing to their inferiority in malice
and mischief: according to the rule among men, that the worse they are,
the less they can know of Christ. [The <i>Homilies</i> of Origen are

even His equality with the Father; why dost
thou wonder at His having for a time disguised this also, taking order
as He was for a certain great and marvellous purpose?<note n="111" id="iii.vi-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p9">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p9.1">θαυμαστν τι

other matters, for which they had frequent precedents likewise in the
old dispensation, they were quite shameless in their obstinacy<note n="112" id="iii.vi-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p10"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p10.1">φανερ

because He healed on the Sabbath day, they supposed Him to be an
adversary of God; and yet oftentimes even before this had the Sabbath
been broken), what would they not have said, if this had been told
them? Especially as<note n="113" id="iii.vi-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p11">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p11.1">Κα
γρ</span>.]</p></note>they had all time before this on their side, in that it never had
produced any such thing. For if after so many miracles they still
called Him son of Joseph, how before the miracles would they have
believed that He was born of a virgin?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p12">It is then for this reason that both Joseph has his
genealogy traced, and the Virgin betrothed to him. For if even he, who
was both a just and wondrous man, required many things, in order that
he should receive that which had come to pass; an angel, and the vision
in dreams, and the testimony from the prophets; how could the Jews,
being both dull and depraved, and of so unfriendly spirit towards Him,
have admitted this idea into their minds? For the strangeness and
novelty thereof would be sure greatly to disturb them, and the fact
that they had never so much as heard of such a thing having happened in
the times of their forefathers. For as the man who was once persuaded
that He is Son of God, would after that have no cause to doubt
concerning this too; so he who was accounting Him to be a deceiver and
an adversary of God, how could he but have been yet more offended by
this, and have been led on unto the opposite<note n="114" id="iii.vi-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p13">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p13.1">ἐκενην</span>.]</p></note>notion? For this cause neither do the apostles at the first directly
say this, but while of His resurrection they discourse much and often
(forasmuch as of this there were examples in the times before, although
not such as this); that He was born of a virgin they do not say always:
nay, not even His mother herself ventured to utter this. See, for
instance, what saith the Virgin even to Himself: “Behold, Thy
father and I have sought Thee.”<note n="115" id="iii.vi-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p14"><scripRef passage="Luke ii. 48" id="iii.vi-p14.1" parsed="|Luke|2|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.2.48">Luke ii.
48</scripRef>.</p></note> For if this suspicion had been entertained, neither would He any longer
have been accounted to be a Son of David, and this opinion not being
held, many other evils besides would have arisen. For this cause
neither do the angels say these things to all, but to Mary only, and
Joseph; but when showing to the shepherds the glad tidings of that
which was come to pass, they no longer added this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p15">2. But why is it, that having mentioned Abraham, and
having said that “he begat Isaac, and Isaac, Jacob;” and
not having made any mention of his brother; when he is come to Jacob,
he remembers both “Judah, and his brethren”? Now there are
some that say, it was because of the perverseness of Esau, and of the
rest that came before. But I should not say this; for if it were so,
how is it that he a little after mentions such women? It being out of
contraries, in this place, that His glory is manifested; not by having
great forefathers, but low and of little account. For to the lofty One
it is a great glory to be able to abase Himself exceedingly. Wherefore
then did He not mention them? Because Saracens, and Ishmaelites, and
Arabians, and as many as are sprung from those ancestors, have nothing
in common with the race of the Israelites. For this cause then he
passes over those in silence, and hastens on to His forefathers, and
those of the Jewish people. Wherefore he saith, “And Jacob begat
Judas and his brethren.” For at this point the race of the Jews
begins to have its peculiar mark.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p16">3. “And Judas begat Phares and Zara of
Thamar.”<note n="116" id="iii.vi-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p17"><scripRef passage="Matt. i. 3" id="iii.vi-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.3">Matt. i.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>“What doest thou, O man, putting us in remembrance of a history
that contains an unlawful intercourse?” But why is this said?<note n="117" id="iii.vi-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p18">[More accurately, “But why is this? one may
say.”—R.]</p></note> Since, if we were recounting the race of a mere man, one might
naturally have been silent touching these things; but if of God
Incarnate, so far from being silent, one ought to make a glory of them,
showing forth His tender care, and His power. Yea, it was for this
cause He came, not to escape our disgraces, but to bear them away.
Therefore as He is the more admired, in that He not only died, but was
even crucified (though the thing be opprobrious, yet the more
opprobrious the more doth it show Him full of love to man), so likewise
may we speak touching His birth; it is not only because He took flesh
upon Him, and became man, that we justly stand amazed at Him, but
because He vouchsafed to have also such kinsfolk,

<pb n="16" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_16.html" id="iii.vi-Page_16" />

being in no respect ashamed of our evils. And
this He was proclaiming from the very beginnings of His birth, that He
is ashamed of none of those things that belong to us; while He teaches
us also hereby, never to hide our face at our forefathers’
wickedness, but to seek after one thing alone, even virtue. For such a
man, though he have an alien for his ancestor, though he have a mother
who is a prostitute, or what you will, can take no hurt thereby. For if
the whoremonger himself, being changed, is nothing disgraced by his
former life, much more will the wickedness of his ancestry have no
power to bring to shame him that is sprung of an harlot or an
adulteress, if he be virtuous.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p19">But he did these things not only to instruct us, but
also to bring down the haughtiness of the Jews. For since they,
negligent about virtue in their own souls, were parading the name of
Abraham,<note n="118" id="iii.vi-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p20">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p20.1">τν
Αβραμ νω κα
κτω
παρφερον</span>.]</p></note>thinking they had for a plea their forefathers’ virtue; he shows
from the very beginning that it is not in these things men ought to
glory, but in their own good deeds.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p21">Besides this, he is establishing another point also, to
show that all are under sin, even their forefathers themselves. At
least their patriarch and namesake is shown to have committed no small
sin, for Thamar stands against him, to accuse his whoredom. And David
too had Solomon by the wife whom he corrupted. But if by the great ones
the law was not fulfilled, much more by the less. And if it was not
fulfilled, all have sinned, and Christ’s coming is become
necessary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p22">For this cause he made mention also of the twelve
patriarchs, by this again bringing down their pride at the noble birth
of their fathers. Because many of these also were born of women that
were slaves; but nevertheless the difference of the parents did not
make a difference in the children. For all were equally both patriarchs
and heads of tribes. For this is the precedence of the Church, this the
prerogative of the nobility that is among us, taking its type from the
beginning. So that whether thou be bond or free, thou hast from thence
nothing more nor less; but the question is all about one thing only,
namely, the mind, and the disposition of the soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p23">4. But besides what we have said, there is another cause
also, wherefore he hath mentioned even this history; for to be sure,
Zara’s name was not cast at random on that of Phares. (For indeed
it was irrelevant, and superfluous, when he had mentioned Phares, from
whom he was to trace Christ’s genealogy, to mention Zara also.)
Wherefore then did he mention him? When Thamar was on the point of
giving birth to them, the pangs having come upon her, Zara put forth
his hand first.<note n="119" id="iii.vi-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p24"><scripRef passage="Gen. xxxviii. 27" id="iii.vi-p24.1" parsed="|Gen|38|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.38.27">Gen.

known, bound his hand with scarlet; but the child, when he was bound,
drew in his hand, and when he had drawn it in, Phares came forth first,
and then Zara. The midwife when she saw this said, “Why was the
hedge broken up for thee?”<note n="120" id="iii.vi-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p25">Our marginal translation is, “Wherefore hast

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p26">Seest thou the dark expression of mysteries? For it was
not without purpose that these things were recorded for us: since
neither was it worth our study to learn, what it might be that the
midwife said; nor worth a narrative to know, that he who came out
second, put forth his hand first. What then is the mysterious
lesson?<note n="121" id="iii.vi-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p27"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p27.1">τ

chosen to suggest that the name of the child came from the greeting
given it by the midwife.—R.]</p></note>we learn what is inquired, for Phares is “a division,” and
“a breach.” And moreover from the thing itself, which took
place; for it was not in the order of nature that, having thrust out
his hand, he should draw it in again when bound; these thing neither
belonged to a movement directed by reason, nor did they take place in
the way of natural consequence. For after the hand had found its way
out, that another child should come forth before was perhaps not
unnatural; but that he should draw it back, and give a passage for
another, was no longer after the manner of children at the birth, but
the grace of God was present with the children, ordering these things,
and sketching out for us by them a sort of image of the things that
were to come.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p29">What then? Some of those who have examined these things
accurately say, that these children are a type of the two nations.<note n="123" id="iii.vi-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p30"><i>i.e</i>., The Jewish and the Christian. Compare
the 62d Homily on Genesis, t. i. 478, ed. Sav. “Zara being
interpreted, is ‘the East.’ And that these things did not
take place at random, but were a type of what was to come, the facts
themselves indicate. For that which happened was not in the order of
nature. For how was it possible, when the hand had been bound with the
scarlet thread, for it to be again drawn back to afford passage to him
who came after had there not been some divine power which before
ordained these things, and as in a kind of shadow drew out this figure;
that at first and from the beginning Zara (that is the East, which is
the type of the Church) began to increase, and after it had made a
little progress and then retired, the observance of the Law,
represented by Phares, came in: and after prevailing a long time, on a
second advance of Zara, who had before retired, made room on the
contrary for the Church; I mean, the whole Jewish polity did
so.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p31">“Perhaps, however, it is necessary now to state
the matter more briefly and clearly. There was a beginning, like the
putting forth of Zara’s hand, in Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchisedek,
Abraham, making extreme account of what might please God. Afterwards,
when they had grown into a multitude, and had heaped on themselves
heavy burdens of sin, and needed the benefit of some slight
consolation, the Law was given as a kind of shadow, not as taking away
sins, but as declaring and making them manifest: that as imperfect
children living on milk they might be capable of attaining full age.
But when even thus they failed of profiting, yea, kept mingling
themselves up again with their sins, all the while that the Law was
pointing out the greatness of the same, He came who is our common Lord,
and freely bestowed on mankind this present spiritual polity, full of
all virtue, whereof Zara was to stand as a type. For this cause the
evangelist also both mentioned Thamar and her children, saying,
‘Judas begat Pharez and Zarah of Thamar.’” Compare
also St. Cyr. of Alex. 6 lib. in Gen. t. i. 201, ed. Aubert; Theod. in
Gen. qu. 96; St. Aug. in <scripRef passage="Ps. 61" id="iii.vi-p31.1" parsed="|Ps|61|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.61">Ps. 61</scripRef>, t. iv. 442, D. [A good specimen of the
allegorizing exegesis which even such an expositor as Chrysostom could
indulge in. The detailed account of the birth of Pharez is justified by
the importance attached to the position of first-born.—R.]</p></note>

And so in order that thou mightest
learn that the polity of the latter people shone forth previously to
the origin of the former, the child that hath the hand stretched forth
doth not show itself entire, but draws even it in again; and after his
brother had glided forth whole, then he too appears entire. And this
took place also with regard to the two nations. I mean, that after the
polity of the Church had been manifested in the times of Abraham, and
then had been withdrawn in the midst of its course, the Jewish people
came, and the legal polity, and then the new people appeared entire
with their own laws. Wherefore also the midwife saith, “Why was
the hedge broken up for thee?” because the law coming in had
broken in upon the freedom of the polity. For indeed the Scripture is
ever wont to call the law a hedge; as the prophet saith: “Thou
hast broken down her hedge, so that all they which pass by the way do
pluck off her grapes:”<note n="124" id="iii.vi-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p32"><scripRef passage="Ps. lxxx. 12" id="iii.vi-p32.1" parsed="|Ps|80|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.80.12">Ps. lxxx.

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p38">See, for instance, what befell Ruth, how like it is to
the things which belong to us. For she was both of a strange race, and
reduced to the utmost poverty, yet Boaz when he saw her neither
despised her poverty nor abhorred her mean birth, as Christ having
received the Church, being both an alien and in much poverty, took her
to be partaker of the great blessings. But even as Ruth, if she had not
before left her father, and renounced household and race, country and
kindred, would not have attained unto this alliance; so the Church too,
having forsaken the customs which men had received from their fathers,
then, and not before,<note n="129" id="iii.vi-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p39">[The Greek text has simply <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p39.1"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p39.2">ττε</span></span><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p39.3">,</span> a
term that is usually paraphrased by the translator.—R.]</p></note>became lovely to the Bridegroom. Of this therefore the prophet
discourses unto her, and saith, “Forget thy people, and thy
father’s house, so shall the king have pleasure in thy
beauty.”<note n="130" id="iii.vi-p39.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p40"><scripRef passage="Ps. xlv. 11, 12" id="iii.vi-p40.1" parsed="|Ps|45|11|45|12" osisRef="Bible:Ps.45.11-Ps.45.12">Ps. xlv.

even as the Church did likewise. For of her David himself sprung. So
then to shame them by all these things, and to prevail on them not to
be high-minded, he hath both composed the genealogy, and brought
forward these women. Yes, for this last, through those who intervened,
was parent to the great king, and of these David is not ashamed. For it
cannot, nay, it cannot be that a man should be good or bad, obscure or
glorious, either by the virtue or by the vice of his forefathers; but
if one must say somewhat even paradoxical, he shines forth the more,
who not being of worthy ancestors, has yet become excellent.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p41">6. Let no one therefore be high-minded on account of
these matters, but let him consider the forefathers of the Lord, and
put away all his haughtiness, and let good actions be his pride; or
rather, not even these. For thus it was that the Pharisee came to be
inferior to the Publican. Thus, if thou wouldest show the good work to
be great, have no high thought,<note n="131" id="iii.vi-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p42">[That is, no proud thought.—R.]</p></note>and thou hast proved it so much the greater. Make account that thou
hast done nothing, and then thou hast done all. For if, being sinners,
when we account ourselves to be what we are, we

<pb n="18" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_18.html" id="iii.vi-Page_18" />

become righteous, as indeed the Publican did;
how much more, when being righteous we account ourselves to be sinners.
Since if out of sinners men are made righteous by a lowly mind
(although this were not to be lowly-minded but to be right-minded); if
then to be right-minded avails so much in the case of sinners, consider
what will not lowliness of mind do with respect to righteous men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p43">Do not then mar thy labors, nor cast away from thee the
fruits of thy toils, neither run thou in vain, making frustrate all thy
labor after the many courses thou hast run. Nay, for thy Lord knows thy
good works better than thou dost. Though thou give but a cup of cold
water, not even this doth He overlook; though thou contribute but a
farthing, though thou shouldest utter a sigh only, He receives it all
with great favor and is mindful thereof, and assigns for it great
rewards.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p44">But wherefore dost thou search out thine own doings, and
bring them out before us continually? Knowest thou not, that if thou
praise thyself, God will no more praise thee? even as if thou bewail
<i>thyself</i>,<note n="132" id="iii.vi-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p45">[“Thyself” is supplied by the
translator.—R.]</p></note> He will not cease proclaiming thee before all. For it is not at all His
will that thy labors should be disparaged. Why do I say, disparaged?
Nay, He is doing and contriving all things, so that even for little He
may crown thee; and He goes about seeking excuses, whereby thou mayest
be delivered from hell. For this cause, though thou shouldest work but
the eleventh hour of the day, He gives thy wages entire; and though
thou afford no ground of salvation, He saith, “I do it for mine
own sake, that my name be not profaned:”<note n="133" id="iii.vi-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p46"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xxxvi. 22" id="iii.vi-p46.1" parsed="|Ezek|36|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.36.22">Ezek.
xxxvi. 22</scripRef>.</p></note>though thou shouldest sigh only, though thou shouldest only weep, all
these things He quickly catches hold of, for an occasion of saving
thee.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p47">Let us not therefore lift up ourselves, but let us
declare ourselves unprofitable, that we may become profitable. For if
thou call thyself approved, thou art become unprofitable, though thou
wert approved; but if useless, thou art become profitable, even though
thou wert reprobate.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p48">7. Wherefore it is necessary to forget our good actions.
“Yet how is it possible,” one may say, “not to know
these things with which we are well acquainted?” How sayest thou?
Offending thy Lord perpetually, thou livest delicately, and laughest,
and dost not so much as know that thou hast sinned, but hast consigned
all to oblivion; and of thy good actions canst thou not put away the
memory? And yet fear is a stronger kind of thing. But we do the very
contrary; on the one hand, whilst each day we are offending, we do not
so much as put it before our mind; on the other, if we give a little
money to a poor person, this we are ever revolving. This kind of
conduct comes of utter madness, and it is a very great loss to him who
so makes his reckoning.<note n="134" id="iii.vi-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p49"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.vi-p49.1">το
συλλγοντο</span>.</p></note> For the secure storehouse of good works is to forget our good works.
And as with regard to raiment and gold, when we expose them in a
market-place, we attract many ill-meaning persons; but if we put them
by at home and hide them, we shall deposit them all in security: even
so with respect to our good deeds; if we are continually keeping them
in memory, we provoke the Lord, we arm the enemy, we invite him to
steal them away; but if no one know of them, besides Him who alone
ought to know, they will lie in safety.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p50">Be not therefore for ever parading them, lest some one
should take them away. As was the case with the Pharisee, for bearing
them about upon his lips; whence also the devil caught them away. And
yet it was with thanksgiving he made mention of them, and referred the
whole to God. But not even did this suffice Him. For it is not
thanksgiving to revile others, to be vainglorious before many, to exalt
one’s self against them that have offended. Rather, if thou art
giving thanks to God, be content with Him only, and publish it not unto
men, neither condemn thy neighbor; for this is not thanksgiving.
Wouldest thou learn words of thanksgiving? hearken unto the Three
Children, saying, “We have sinned, we have transgressed. Thou art
righteous, O Lord, in all that thou hast done unto us, because thou
hast brought all things upon us by a true judgment.”<note n="135" id="iii.vi-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p51"><scripRef passage="Song of the Three Children, Vers. 6, 8, 4" id="iii.vi-p51.1">Song of the

offenses, yet not to have the due penalty exacted. This man most of all
is the giver of thanks.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.vi-p54">8. Let us beware therefore of saying anything about
ourselves, for this renders us both odious with men and abominable to
God. For this reason, the greater the good works we do, the less let us
say of ourselves; this being the way to reap the greatest glory both
with men and with God. Or rather, not only glory from God, but a
reward, yea, a great recompense. Demand not therefore a reward that
thou mayest receive a reward.

<pb n="19" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_19.html" id="iii.vi-Page_19" />

Confess thyself to be saved by grace, that He
may profess Himself a debtor to thee; and not for thy good works only,
but also for such rightness of mind. For when we do good works, we have
Him debtor for our good works only; but when we do not so much as think
we have done any good work, then also for this disposition itself; and
more for this, than for the other things: so that this is equivalent to
our good works. For should this be absent, neither will they appear
great. For in the same way, we too, when we have servants,<note n="138" id="iii.vi-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.vi-p55"><scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 10" id="iii.vi-p55.1" parsed="|Luke|17|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.10">Luke xvii.

service with good will, they do not think they have done anything

to Saul, again and again, even oftentimes, what excellence of
self-restraint doth it not show? Yea, for he even surpassed the old
law, and came near to the apostolic injunctions. For this cause he bore
with contentedness all that came from the Lord’s hands; not
contending against what befell him, but aiming at one object alone,
namely, in everything to obey, and follow the laws set by Him. And when
after so many noble deeds on his part, he saw the tyrant, the
parricide, the murderer of his own brother, that injurious, that
frenzied one, possessing in his stead his own kingdom, not even so was
he offended. But “if this please God,” saith he,
“that I should be chased, and wander, and flee, and that he
should be in honor, I acquiesce, and accept it, and do thank God for
His many afflictions.” Not like many of the shameless and
impudent ones, who when they have not done, no not the least part of
his good works, yet if they see any in prosperity, and themselves
enduring a little discouragement, ruin their own souls by ten thousand

fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away into

Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.IV_1-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.IV_1-p4.1">He</span> hath divided all the
generations into three portions, to indicate that not even when their
form of government was changed did they become better, but alike under
an aristocracy, and under a king, and under an oligarchy, they were in
the same evil ways, and whether popular leaders, or priests, or kings
controlled them, it was no advantage to them in the way of virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p5">But wherefore hath he in the middle portion passed over

affirmed them to be fourteen? The former question I leave for you to

generation, both the time of the captivity, and Christ Himself, by
every means connecting Him with us. And full well doth he put us in
mind of that captivity, making it manifest that not even when they went
down thither, did they become more sober-minded; in order that from
everything His coming may be shown to be necessary.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p8">“Why then,” one may say, “doth not
Mark do this, nor trace Christ’s genealogy, but utter everything
briefly?” It seems to me that Matthew was before the rest in
entering on the subject (wherefore he both sets down the genealogy with
exactness, and stops at those things which require it): but that Mark
came after him, which is why he took a short course, as putting his
hand to what had been already spoken and made manifest.<note n="156" id="iii.IV_1-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p9">[But see Homily I. 5, 6, where the independence of

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p10">How is it then that Luke not only traces the genealogy,
but doth it through a greater number? As was natural, Matthew having
led the way, he seeks to teach us somewhat in addition to former
statements. And each too in like manner imitated his master; the one
Paul, who flows fuller than any river; the other Peter, who studies
brevity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p11">2. And what may be the reason that Matthew said not at
the beginning, in the same way as the prophet, “the vision which
I saw,” and “the word which came unto me”? Because he
was writing unto men well disposed, and exceedingly attentive to him.
For both the miracles that were done cried aloud, and they who received
the word were exceeding faithful. But in the case of the prophets,
there were neither so many miracles to proclaim them; and besides, the
tribe of the false prophets, no small one, was riotously breaking in
upon them: to whom the people of the Jews gave even more heed. This
kind of opening therefore was necessary in their case.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p12">And if ever miracles were done, they were done for the
aliens’ sake, to increase the number of the proselytes; and for
manifestation of God’s power, if haply their enemies having taken
them captives, fancied they prevailed,

because their own gods were mighty: like as in
Egypt, out of which no small “mixed multitude”<note n="157" id="iii.IV_1-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p13"><scripRef passage="Exod. xii. 38; Jer. l. 37" id="iii.IV_1-p13.1" parsed="|Exod|12|38|0|0;|Jer|50|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.12.38 Bible:Jer.50.37">Exod. xii.

and the dreams. And miracles were wrought also, when they were by
themselves in the wilderness; as also in our case: for among us too,
when we had just come out of error, many wonderful works were shown
forth; but afterwards they stayed, when in all countries true religion
had taken root.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p14">And what took place at a later period<note n="158" id="iii.IV_1-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p15">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p15.1">Ε δ κα

course, and started back in the opposite direction. And this one may
see to have occurred in our case also. For so even in our generation,
in the instance of him who surpassed all in ungodliness, I mean Julian,
many strange things happened. Thus when the Jews were attempting to
raise up again the temple at Jerusalem, fire burst out from the
foundations, and utterly hindered them all; and when both his
treasurer,<note n="159" id="iii.IV_1-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p16">“The tyrant commanded the sacred vessels to be
delivered up to the imperial treasury.…Into the Temple of God
then,” at Antioch, “there entered, along with Julian the
Prefect of the East, Felix the Steward of the Imperial
Treasures…And they say that Julian grievously insulted the sacred
table, and when Euzoius” (the Arian bishop) “endeavored to
prevent him, he gave him a blow on the temple…Julian, however,
presently fell into a grievous disease, and had his bowels wasted with
a kind of mortification…and so came to an end of his life. Felix
also for his part being afflicted with a scourge from God, had to vomit
blood night and day from his mouth…until he also wasted
away.” Theodoret. E H. iii. 8, 9, ed. Schulze. See also Sozom. E.

where he says that Felix “burst asunder.”</p></note>and his uncle and namesake, made the sacred vessels the subject of
their open insolence, the one was “eaten with worms, and gave up
the ghost,”<note n="160" id="iii.IV_1-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p17"><scripRef passage="Acts xii. 23, i. 18" id="iii.IV_1-p17.1" parsed="|Acts|12|23|0|0;|Acts|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.12.23 Bible:Acts.1.18">Acts xii.

fountains failing,<note n="161" id="iii.IV_1-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p18">He mentions this miracle too with the former ones,

“The fountains among us, whose current is stronger than the
rivers, shrank suddenly and started back (a thing which never had
occurred to them before), upon the Emperor’s attempting to defile
the place with sacrifices and libations.”</p></note>when sacrifices were made there, and the entrance of the famine into
the cities together with the emperor himself, was a very great sign.
For it is usual with God to do such things; when evils are multiplied,
and He sees His own people afflicted, and their adversaries greatly
intoxicated with their dominion over them, then to display His own
power; which he did also in Persia with respect to the Jews.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p19">3. Wherefore, that he was not acting without an object,
or by chance, when he distributed Christ’s forefathers into three
portions, is plain from what hath been said. And mark, too, whence he
begins, and where he ends. From Abraham to David; from David to the
captivity of Babylon; from this unto Christ Himself. For both at the
beginning he put the two in close succession, David and Abraham, and
also in summing up he mentions both in the same way. And this, because,
as I have already said, it was to them that the promises were made.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p20">But why can it be, that as he mentioned the captivity of
Babylon, he did not mention also the descent into Egypt? Because they
had ceased to be any longer afraid of the Egyptians, but the
Babylonians they dreaded still. And the one thing was ancient, but the
other fresh, and had taken place of late. And to the one they were
carried down for no sins, but to the other, transgressions were the
cause of their being removed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p21">And also with regard to the very names, if any one were
to attempt to translate their etymologies, even thence would he derive
great matter of divine speculation,<note n="162" id="iii.IV_1-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p22"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p22.1">θεωραν</span>: the allegorical or
mystical sense. See Suicer on the word; and St. Just. Mart. Cohort. ad
Græc. p. 29. A. Ed. Morell. See also in the Catena Aurea, from St.
Jerome, the interpretation of the names in our Lord’s
genealogy.</p></note>and such as is of great importance with regard to the New Testament:
as, for instance, from Abraham’s name, from Jacob’s, from
Solomon’s, from Zorobabel’s. For it was not without purpose
that these names were given them. But lest we should seem to be
wearisome by running out a great length, let us pass these things by,
and proceed to what is urgent.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p23">4. Having then mentioned all His forefathers, and ending
with Joseph, he did not stop at this, but added, “Joseph the
husband of Mary;” intimating that it was for her sake he traced
his genealogy also. Then, lest when thou hast heard of the
“husband of Mary,” thou shouldest suppose that Christ was
born after the common law of nature, mark, how he sets it right by that
which follows. “Thou hast heard,” saith he, “of an
husband, thou hast heard of a mother, thou hast heard a name assigned
to the child, therefore hear the manner too of the birth.”
“The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.”<note n="163" id="iii.IV_1-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. i. 18" id="iii.IV_1-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.18">Matt. i.

thou hast already mentioned His ancestors?” “I still wish
to tell thee the manner also of His birth.” Seest thou, how he
wakens up the hearer? For as though he were about to speak of something
unusual,<note n="164" id="iii.IV_1-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p25">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p25.1">καιντερον</span>.]</p></note>he promises to tell also the manner thereof.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p26">And observe a most admirable order in the things he hath
mentioned. For he did not proceed directly to the birth, but puts us in
mind first, how many generations he was from Abraham, how many from
David, and from the captivity of Babylon; and thus he

<pb n="22" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_22.html" id="iii.IV_1-Page_22" />

sets the careful hearer upon considering the
times, to show that this is the Christ who was preached by the
prophets. For when thou hast numbered the generations, and hast learnt
by the time that this is He, thou wilt readily receive likewise the
miracle which took place in His birth. Thus, being about to tell of a
certain great thing, His birth of a virgin, he first shadows over the
statement, until he hath numbered the generations, by speaking of
“an husband of Mary;” or rather he doth even put in short
space<note n="165" id="iii.IV_1-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p27"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p27.1">σντεμνει</span>.</p></note>the narration of the birth itself, and then proceeds to number also the
years, reminding the hearer, that this is He, of whom the patriarch
Jacob had said, He should then at length come, when the Jewish rulers
had come to an end; of whom the prophet Daniel had proclaimed
beforehand, that He should come after those many weeks. And if any one,
counting the years spoken of to Daniel by the angel in a number of
weeks, would trace down the time from the building of the city to His
birth, by reckoning he will perceive the one to agree with the other.<note n="166" id="iii.IV_1-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p28">See the different opinions of the Fathers on these
dates, in St. Jerome on <scripRef passage="Daniel ix." id="iii.IV_1-p28.1" parsed="|Dan|9|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.9">Daniel ix.</scripRef></p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p29">5. How then was He born, I pray thee? “When as His
mother Mary was espoused:”<note n="167" id="iii.IV_1-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. i. 18" id="iii.IV_1-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|1|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.18">Matt. i.
18</scripRef>.</p></note> He saith not “virgin,” but merely “mother;” so
that his account is easy to be received. And so having beforehand
prepared the hearer to look for some ordinary piece of information, and
by this laying hold of him, after all he amazes him by adding the
marvellous fact, saying, “Before they came together, she was
found with child of the Holy Ghost.” He saith not, “before
she was brought to the bridegroom’s house;” for indeed she
was therein. It being the way of the ancients for the most part to keep
their espoused wives in their house:<note n="168" id="iii.IV_1-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p31"><scripRef passage="Gen. xix. 8, 14" id="iii.IV_1-p31.1" parsed="|Gen|19|8|0|0;|Gen|19|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.19.8 Bible:Gen.19.14">Gen. xix.
8, 14</scripRef>.</p></note>in those parts, at least, where one may see the same practised even
now. Thus also Lot’s sons-in-law were in his house with him. Mary
then herself likewise was in the house with Joseph.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p32">And wherefore did she not conceive before her espousal?
It was, as I said at first, that what had been done might be concealed
awhile, and that the Virgin might escape every evil suspicion. For when
he, who had most right of all to feel jealousy, so far from making her
a show, or degrading her, is found even receiving and cherishing her
after her conception; it was quite clear that, unless he had fully
persuaded himself that what was done was of the operation of the Holy
Spirit, he would not have kept her with him, and ministered to her in
all other things. And most properly hath he said, that “she was
‘found’ with child,” the sort of expression that is
wont to be used with respect to things strange, and such as happen
beyond all expectation, and are unlooked for.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p33">Proceed therefore no further, neither require anything
more than what hath been said; neither say thou, “But how was it
that the Spirit wrought this of a virgin?” For if, when nature is
at work, it is impossible to explain the manner of the formation; how,
when the Spirit is working miracles, shall we be able to express these?
And lest thou shouldest weary the evangelist, or disturb him by
continually asking these things, he hath said who it was that wrought
the miracle, and so withdrawn himself. “For I know,” saith
he, “nothing more, but that what was done was the work of the
Holy Ghost.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p34">6. Shame on them who busy themselves touching the
generation on high. For if this birth, which hath witnesses without
number, and had been proclaimed so long a time before, and was
manifested and handled with hands, can by no man be explained; of what
excess of madness do they come short who make themselves busy and
curious touching that unutterable generation? For neither Gabriel nor
Matthew was able to say anything more, but only that it was of the
Spirit; but how, of the Spirit, or in what manner, neither of them hath
explained; for neither was it possible.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p35">Nor think that thou hast learnt all, by hearing
“of the Spirit;” nay, for we are ignorant of many things,
even when we have learnt this; as, for instance, how the Infinite is in
a womb, how He that contains all things is carried, as unborn, by a
woman; how the Virgin bears, and continues a virgin. How, I pray thee,
did the Spirit frame that Temple? how did He take not all the flesh
from the womb, but a part thereof, and increased it, and fashioned it?
For that He did come forth of the Virgin’s flesh, He hath
declared by speaking of “that which was conceived in

lest you should suspect the disciple as inventing these things to favor
his Master;—he introduces Joseph as contributing, by what he
underwent, to the proof of the things mentioned; and by his narrative
all but says, “If thou doubt me, and if thou suspect my
testimony, believe her husband.” For “Joseph,” saith
he, “her husband, being a just man.” By “a just
man” in this place he means him that is virtuous in all things.
For both freedom from covetousness is justice, and universal virtue is
also justice;<note n="177" id="iii.IV_1-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p46">See Arist. Eth. Nicom. v. 1, 2.</p></note>and it is mostly in this latter sense that the Scripture uses the name

was minded to put her away privily.” For this intent he tells
what took place before Joseph’s being fully informed, that thou
mightest not mistrust what was done after he knew. However, such a one
was not liable to be made a public example only, but that she should
also be punished was the command of the law. Whereas Joseph remitted
not only that greater punishment, but the less likewise, namely, the
disgrace. For so far from punishing, he was not minded even to make an
example of her. Seest thou a man under self-restraint, and freed from
the most tyrannical of passions. For ye know how great a thing jealousy
is: and therefore He said, to whom these things are clearly known,

than fall under the suspicion of jealousy. But in this case it was not
so little as suspicion, the burden of the womb entirely convicting her.
But nevertheless he was so free from passion as to be unwilling to
grieve the Virgin even in the least matters. Thus, whereas to keep her
in his house seemed like a transgression of the law, but to expose and
bring her to trial would constrain him to deliver her to die; he doth
none of these things, but conducts himself now by a higher rule than
the law. For grace being come, there must needs henceforth be many
tokens of that exalted citizenship. For as the sun, though as yet he
show not his beams, doth from afar by his light illumine more than
half<note n="182" id="iii.IV_1-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p51">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p51.1">τ

before He came forth, shone over all the world. Wherefore, even before
her travail, prophets danced for joy, and women foretold what was to
come, and John, when he had not yet come forth from the belly, leaped
from the very womb. Hence also this man exhibited great self-command,
in that he neither accused nor upbraided, but only set about putting
her away.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p52">8. The matter then being in this state, and all at their
wits’ end,<note n="183" id="iii.IV_1-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p53">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p53.1">πντων

inquiring, why the angel did not speak sooner, before the husband had
such thoughts: but, “when he thought on it,” not until
then, he came; for it is said, “While he thought on these things,
the angel” comes. And yet to her he declares the good tidings
even before she conceived. And this again contains another difficulty;
for even though the angel had not spoken, wherefore was the Virgin
silent, who had been informed by the angel; and why, when she saw her
betrothed husband in trouble, did she not put an end to his
perplexity?</p>

<pb n="24" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_24.html" id="iii.IV_1-Page_24" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p54">Wherefore then did not the angel speak before Joseph
became troubled. For we must needs explain the former difficulty first.
For what reason then did he not speak? Lest Joseph should be
unbelieving, and the same happen to him as to Zacharias. For when the
thing was visible, belief was thenceforth easy; but when it had not yet
a beginning, it was not equally easy to receive his saying. For this
reason the angel spake not at the first, and through the same cause the
Virgin too held her peace. For she did not think to obtain credit with
her betrothed husband, in declaring to him a thing unheard of, but
rather that she should provoke him the more, as though she were cloking
a sin that had been committed. Since if she herself, who was to receive
so great a favor, is affected somewhat after the manner of man, and
saith, “How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?”<note n="184" id="iii.IV_1-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p55"><scripRef passage="Luke i. 34" id="iii.IV_1-p55.1" parsed="|Luke|1|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.34">Luke i.
34</scripRef>.</p></note>much more would he have doubted; and especially when hearing it from
the woman who was under suspicion. Wherefore the Virgin saith nothing
to him, but the angel, the time demanding it, presents himself to
him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p56">9. Why then, it may be asked, did he not so in the
Virgin’s case also, and declare the good tidings to her after the
conception? Lest she should be in agitation and great trouble. For it
were likely that she, not knowing the certainty, might have even
devised something amiss touching herself, and have gone on to strangle
or to stab herself, not enduring the disgrace. For wondrous indeed was
that Virgin, and Luke points out her excellency, saying, that when she
heard the salutation, she did not straightway pour herself out,<note n="185" id="iii.IV_1-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p57">[That is, did not give way to her feeling, with loud
cry, whether of joy or grief.—R.]</p></note>neither did she accept the saying, but “was troubled,”
seeking “what manner of salutation this might be.”<note n="186" id="iii.IV_1-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p58"><scripRef passage="Luke i. 29" id="iii.IV_1-p58.1" parsed="|Luke|1|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.29">Luke i.
29</scripRef>.</p></note> Now she who was of such perfect delicacy would even have been
distracted with dismay at the thought of her shame, not expecting, by
whatever she might say, to convince any one who should hear of it, but
that what had happened was adultery. Therefore to prevent these things,
the angel came before the conception. Besides that, it was meet that
womb should be free from trouble which the Maker of all things entered;
and the soul rid of all perturbation, which was thought worthy to
become the minister of such mysteries. For these reasons He speaks to
the Virgin before the conception, but to Joseph at the time of
travail.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p59">And this many of the simpler sort, not understanding,
have said there is a discordance; because Luke saith it was Mary to
whom he declared the good tidings, but Matthew, that it was Joseph; not
knowing that both took place. And this sort of thing it is necessary to
bear in mind throughout the whole history; for in this way we shall
solve many seeming discordances.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p60">10. The angel then comes, when Joseph is troubled. For
in addition to the causes mentioned, with a view also to the
manifestation of his self-command, he defers his coming. But when the
thing was on the point of taking place, then at last he presents
himself. “While he thought on these things, an angel appeareth to
Joseph in a dream.”<note n="187" id="iii.IV_1-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p61"><scripRef passage="Matt. i. 20" id="iii.IV_1-p61.1" parsed="|Matt|1|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.20">Matt. i.
20</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p62">Seest thou the mildness of the husband? So far from
punishing, he did not even declare it to any one, no not even to her
whom he suspected, but was thinking it over with himself, as aiming to
conceal the cause even from the Virgin herself. For neither is it said
that he was minded to “cast her out,” but to “put her
away,” so very mild and gentle was the man. “But while he
is thinking on these things, the angel appeareth in a dream.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p63">And why not openly, as to the shepherds, and to
Zacharias, and to the Virgin? The man was exceedingly full of faith,
and needed not this vision. Whereas the Virgin, as having declared to
her very exceeding good tidings, greater than to Zacharias, and this
before the event, needed also a marvellous vision; and the shepherds,
as being by disposition rather dull and clownish.<note n="188" id="iii.IV_1-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p64">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p64.1">ἀγροικικτερον</span>,
“more boorish.”—R.]</p></note> But this man, after the conception,<note n="189" id="iii.IV_1-p64.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p65"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p65.1">τν
τκονοικονομουμενα</span>.</p></note>and wide the interval between the two men; wherefore neither was there
need of rebuke.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p66">But by saying, “fear not,” he signifies him
to have been afraid, lest he should give offense to God, as retaining
an adulteress; since, if it had not been for this, he would not have
even thought of casting her out. In all ways then he points out that
the angel came from God, bringing forward and setting before him all,
both what he thought to do, and what he felt in his mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p67">Now having mentioned her name, he stayed not at this,
but added also, “thy wife;” whereas he would not have
called her so, if she had been corrupted. And here he calls her that is
espoused “a wife;” as indeed the Scripture is wont to call
betrothed husbands sons-in-law even before marriage.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p68">But what means, “to take unto thee?” To
retain her in his house, for in intention she had been now put away by
him. “Her, being put away, do thou retain,” saith he,
“as committed unto thee by God, not by her parents. And He
commits her not for marriage; but to dwell with thee; and by my voice
doth He commit her.” Much as Christ Himself afterwards committed
her to His disciple, so even now unto Joseph.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p69">12. Then having obscurely signified the matter in hand,
he mentioned not the evil suspicion; but, in a manner more reverent and
seemly, by telling the cause of travail he removed this also; implying
that the very thing which had made him afraid, and for which he would
have cast her out,—this very thing, I say, was a just cause why
he should take her and retain her in his house. Thus more than
entirely<note n="190" id="iii.IV_1-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p70"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p70.1">ἐκ
περιουσα</span>,
“superabundantly.”—R.]</p></note>doing away with his distress. “For she is not only free,”
saith he, “from unlawful intercourse, but even above all nature
is her conception. Not only therefore put away thy fear, but even
rejoice more exceedingly, ‘for that which is conceived in her is
of the Holy Ghost.’”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p71">A strange thing it was which he spake of, surpassing
man’s reason, and above all the laws of nature. How then is he to
believe, to whom such tidings are altogether new? “By the things
that are past,” saith he, “by the revelations.” For
with this intent he laid open all things that were in his mind, what he
felt, what he feared, what he was resolved to do;—that by these
he might assure himself of this point.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p72">Or rather, not by things past only, but like wise by
things to come, he wins him over. “And she shall bring
forth,” saith he, “a Son, and thou shalt call His name
<span class="c20" id="iii.IV_1-p72.1">Jesus</span>.”<note n="191" id="iii.IV_1-p72.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p73"><scripRef passage="Matt. i. 21" id="iii.IV_1-p73.1" parsed="|Matt|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.21">Matt. i.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>“For do not thou, because He is of the Holy Ghost, imagine that
thou art an alien to the ministry of this dispensation. Since although
in the birth thou hast no part, but the Virgin abode untouched,
nevertheless, what pertains to a father, not injuring the honor of
virginity, that do I give thee, to set a Name on that which is born:
for “thou shalt call Him.” For though the offspring be not
thine, yet shalt thou exhibit a father’s care towards Him.
Wherefore I do straightway, even from the giving of the name, connect
thee with Him that is born.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p74">Then lest on the other hand any one should from this
suspect him to be the father, hear what follows, with what exact care
he states it. “She shall bring forth,” he saith, “a
Son:” he doth not say, “bring forth to thee,” but
merely “she shall bring forth,” putting it
indefinitely:<note n="192" id="iii.IV_1-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p75"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p75.1">μετωρον</span>.</p></note>since not to him did she bring forth, but to the whole world.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p76">13. For this cause too the angel came bringing His name
from Heaven, hereby again intimating that this is a wondrous birth: it
being God Himself who sends the name from above by the angel to Joseph.
For neither was this without an object, but a treasure of ten thousand
blessings. Wherefore the angel also interprets it, and suggests good
hopes, in this way again leading him to belief. For to these things we
are wont to be more inclined, and therefore are also fonder of
believing them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p77">So having established his faith by all, by the past
things, by the future, by the present, by the honor given to himself,
he brings in the prophet also in good time, to give his

<pb n="25" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_25.html" id="iii.IV_1-Page_25" />

suffrage in support of all these. But before
introducing him, he proclaims beforehand the good things which were to
befall the world through Him. And what are these? Sins removed and done
away.<note n="193" id="iii.IV_1-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p78">[More literally, “Removal and destruction of
sins.”—R.]</p></note>“For He shall save His people from their sins.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p79">Here again the thing is signified to be beyond all
expectation. For not from visible wars, neither from barbarians, but
what was far greater than these, from sins, he declares the glad
tidings of deliverance; a work which had never been possible to any one
before.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p80">But wherefore, one may ask, did he say, “His
people,” and not add the Gentiles also? That he might not startle
the hearer yet a while. For to him that listens with understanding he
darkly signified the Gentiles too. For “His people” are not
the Jews only, but also all that draw nigh and receive the knowledge
that is from Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p81">And mark how he hath by the way discovered to us also
His dignity, by calling the Jewish nation “His people.” For
this is the word of one implying nought else, but that He who is born
is God’s child, and that the King of those on high is the subject
of his discourse. As neither doth forgiving sins belong to any other
power, but only to that single essence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p82">14. Forasmuch then as we have partaken of so great a
gift, let us do everything not to dishonor such a benefit. For if even
before this honor, what was done was worthy of punishment, much more
now, after this unspeakable benefit. And this I say not now for no
cause,<note n="194" id="iii.IV_1-p82.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p83">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p83.1">οχ πλ</span>,

the uninitiated, and having nothing peculiar to distinguish them in
their way of life. It is, you see, for this cause, that neither in the
market nor in the Church is it possible to know quickly who is a
believer and who an unbeliever; unless one be present at the time of
the mysteries, and see the one sort put out, the others remaining
within. Whereas they ought to be distinguished not by their place, but
by their way of life. For as men’s outward<note n="195" id="iii.IV_1-p83.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p84"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p84.1">ἔξωθεν</span>. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 13" id="iii.IV_1-p84.2" parsed="|1Cor|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.13">1 Cor. v. 13</scripRef>.</p></note>dignities are naturally to be discovered by the outward signs with
which they are invested, so ours ought to be discernible by the soul.
That is, the believer ought to be manifest not by the gift only, but
also by the new life. The believer ought to be the light and salt of
the world. But when thou dost not give light even to thyself, neither
bind up thine own gangrene, what remains, whereby we are to know thee?
Because thou hast entered the holy waters? Nay, this to thee becomes a
store<note n="196" id="iii.IV_1-p84.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p85"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p85.1">ἐφδιον</span>.</p></note>of punishment. For greatness of honor is, to them who do not choose to
live worthy of the honor, an increase of vengeance. Yea, the believer
ought to shine forth not only by what he hath received from God, but
also by what he himself hath contributed; and should be discernible by
everything, by his gait, by his look, by his garb, by his voice. And
this I have said, not that display, but that the profit of beholders,
may be the rule by which we frame ourselves.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p86">15. But now, what things soever I might seek to
recognize thee by, I find thee in all points distinguished by the
contraries of the same. For whether by thy place I would fain discern
thee, I see thee spending thy day in horse races, and theatres, and
scenes of lawlessness, in the wicked assemblies in the market places,
and in companies of depraved men; or by the fashion of thy countenance,
I see thee continually laughing to excess, and dissolute as a

about parasites and flatterers; or by thy words, I hear thee say
nothing wholesome, nothing necessary, nothing of moment to our life; or

times in this paragraph.—R.]</p></note>in thee, while all the things I have mentioned give the contrary
sentence? And why do I say, the believer? since I can not clearly make
out whether thou art a man. For when thou art like an ass, kicking, and
like a bull, wantoning, and like a horse neighing after women; when
thou dost play the glutton like the bear, and pamper thy flesh as the
mule, and bear malice like the camel;<note n="199" id="iii.IV_1-p89.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p90">The Hebrew name

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p91">Further, if I were bidding thee make another man gentle,
not even so ought I to seem as one enjoining impossible things;
however, thou mightest then object that thou hast not the control of
another’s disposition, and that it doth not altogether rest with
thee. But now it is thine own wild beast, and a thing which absolutely
depends on thee. What plea then hast thou? or what fair excuse wilt
thou be able to put forth, turning as thou art a lion into a man, and
regardless that thou thyself art of a man becoming a lion; upon the
beast bestowing what is above nature, but for thyself not even
preserving what is natural? Yea, while the wild beasts are by thine
earnest endeavors advanced into our noble estate, thou art by thyself
cast down from the throne of the kingdom, and thrust out into their
madness. Thus, imagine, if thou wilt, thy wrath to be a kind of wild
beast, and as much zeal as others have displayed about lions, so much
do thou in regard of thyself, and cause that way of taking things<note n="200" id="iii.IV_1-p91.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p92"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p92.1">τν

talons, and if thou tame it not, it will lay waste all things. For not
even lion nor serpent hath such power to rend the vitals as wrath, with
its iron talons continually doing so. Since it mars, we see, not the
body only, but the very health likewise of the soul is corrupted by it,
devouring, rending, tearing to pieces all its strength, and making it
useless for everything. For if a man nourishing worms in his entrails,
shall not be able so much as to breathe, his inward parts all wasting
away; how shall we, having so large a serpent eating up all within us
(it is wrath I mean), how, I say, shall we be able to produce anything
noble?</p>

kill the worms within us and the serpents. “And of what
nature,” it will be asked, “may this potion be, that hath

for now surely we are in no better state than the dead: forasmuch as it
cannot be, that while those passions live, we should live too, but we
must necessarily perish. And unless we first kill them here, they will
be sure to kill us in the other life; or rather before that death they
will exact of us, even here, the utmost penalty. Yes, for every such
passion is both cruel and tyrannical and insatiable, and never ceases
to devour us every day. For “their teeth are the teeth of a
lion,”<note n="202" id="iii.IV_1-p94.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p95"><scripRef passage="Joel i. 6" id="iii.IV_1-p95.1" parsed="|Joel|1|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Joel.1.6">Joel i.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>or rather even far more fierce. For the lion, as soon as ever he is
satisfied, is wont to leave the carcass that hath fallen in his way;
but these passions neither are satisfied, nor do they leave the man
whom they have seized, until they have set him nigh the devil. For so
great is their power, that the very service which Paul showed forth to
Christ,<note n="203" id="iii.IV_1-p95.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p96"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 38" id="iii.IV_1-p96.1" parsed="|Rom|8|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.38">Rom. viii.

they require of them whom they have seized. For whether it be with the
love of women, or of riches, or of glory, that any one is entangled, he
laughs at hell thenceforth, and despises the kingdom, that he may work
the will of these. Let us not then doubt Paul when he saith that he so
loved Christ. For when some are found so doing service to their
passions, how should that other afterwards seem incredible? Yea, and
this is the reason why our longing for Christ is feebler, because all
our strength is consumed on this love, and we rob, and defraud, and are
slaves to vainglory; than which what can be more worthless?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p97">For though thou shouldest become infinitely conspicuous,
thou wilt be nothing better than the base: rather for this selfsame
cause thou wilt even be baser. For when they who are willing to give
thee glory, and make thee illustrious, do for this very cause ridicule
thee, that thou desirest the glory which comes of them, how can such
instances fail to turn the contrary way in regard of thee. For indeed
this thing is among those which attract censure. So that even as in the
case of one desiring to commit adultery or fornication, should any one
praise or flatter him, by this very act he becomes an accuser rather
than a commender of the person indulging such desires: so with regard
to him who is desirous of glory; when we all praise, it is accusation
rather than praise which we bestow on those who wish to be made
glorious.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p98">18. Why then bring upon thyself that, from which the
very opposite is wont to befall thee. Yea, if thou wilt be glorified,
despise glory; so shalt thou be more illustrious than any. Why feel as
Nebuchadnezzar felt? For he too set up an image, thinking from wood and
from a senseless figure to procure to himself an increase of fame, and
the living would fain appear more glorious by the help of that which
hath no life. Seest thou the excess of his madness; how, thinking to do
honor, he rather offered insult, to himself? For when it appears that
he is relying rather on the lifeless thing, than on himself and the
soul that lives in him, and when for this cause he advances the stock
unto such high precedence, how can he be other than ridiculous,
endeavoring as he doth to adorn himself, not by his way of living, but
by planks of wood? Just as if a man should think proper to give himself
airs, because of the pavement of his house, and his beautiful staircase
rather than because he is a man. Him do many too amongst us imitate
now. For as he for his image, so some men claim to be admired for their
clothes, others for their house; or for their mules and chariots, and
for the columns in their house. For inasmuch as they have lost their
being as men, they go about gathering to themselves from other quarters
such glory as is full of exceeding ridicule.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p99">But as to the noble and great servants of God, not by
these means, but by such as best became them, even by such did they
shine forth. For captives as they were, and slaves, and youths, and
strangers, and stripped of all resources of their own, they proved at
that time far more awful than he who was invested with all these
things. And while Nebuchadnezzar found neither so great an image, nor
satraps, nor captains of the host, nor endless legions, nor abundance
of gold, nor other pomp, enough to meet his desire, and to show him
great; to these, on the other hand, stripped of all this, their high
self-restraint alone was sufficient, and showed him that wore the
diadem and the purple, as much inferior in glory to those who had no
such thing, as the sun is more glorious than a pearl.<note n="204" id="iii.IV_1-p99.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p100"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p100.1">μαργάρου</span>.</p></note> For they were led forth in the midst of the whole world, being at once

youths, and captives, and slaves,
and straightway on their appearance the king darted fire from his eyes,
and captains, and deputies, and governors, and the whole amphitheatre
of the devil, stood around; and a voice of pipes from all sides, and of
trumpets, and of all music, borne up to Heaven, was sounding in their
ears, and the furnace burned up to a boundless height, and the flame
reached the very clouds, and all was full of terror and dismay. But
none of these things dismayed them, but they laughed it all to scorn,
as they would children mocking them, and exhibited their courage and
meekness, and uttering a voice clearer than those trumpets, they said,
“Be it known unto thee, O king.”<note n="205" id="iii.IV_1-p100.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p101"><scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 18" id="iii.IV_1-p101.1" parsed="|Dan|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.18">Dan. iii.

great length, but set forth all briefly; “For there is,”
say they, “a God in Heaven, who is able to deliver us,”<note n="207" id="iii.IV_1-p102.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p103"><scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 17" id="iii.IV_1-p103.1" parsed="|Dan|3|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.17">Dan. iii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p104">Then when they considered that it was possible that God
might be willing even to permit them to be burnt; lest, if this should
come to pass, they might seem to be speaking falsehoods; they add this
also and say, “If this happen not, be it known unto thee, O king,
that we serve not thy gods.”<note n="208" id="iii.IV_1-p104.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p105"><scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 18" id="iii.IV_1-p105.1" parsed="|Dan|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.18">Dan. iii.

Wherefore in this place they are silent on that subject, though they
speak of it in the furnace, again and again alleging their sins. But
before the king they say no such thing; only, that though they were to
be burnt, they would not give up their religion.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p106">For it was not for rewards and recompenses that they did
what they did, but out of love alone; and yet they were in captivity
too, and in slavery, and had enjoyed no good thing. Yea, they had lost
their country, and their freedom, and all their possessions. For tell
me not of their honors in the king’s courts, for holy and
righteous as they were, they would have chosen ten thousand times
rather to have been beggars at home, and to have been partakers of the
blessings in the temple. “For I had rather,” it is said,
“be an outcast<note n="209" id="iii.IV_1-p106.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p107"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p107.1">παραιπτεσθαι</span>,

translation is, “I would choose rather to sit at the
threshold.” [The R.V. margin is, “I had rather stand at the
threshold.”—R.]</p></note>in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of sinners.”
And “one day in thy courts is better than thousands.”<note n="210" id="iii.IV_1-p107.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p108"><scripRef passage="Ps. lxxxiv. 10" id="iii.IV_1-p108.1" parsed="|Ps|84|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.84.10">Ps. lxxxiv.

home, than kings in Babylon. And this is manifest, from what they
declare even in the furnace, grieving at their continuance in that
country. For although themselves enjoyed great honors, yet seeing the
calamities of the rest they were exceedingly vexed; and this kind of
thing is most especially characteristic of saints, that no glory, nor
honor, nor anything else should be more precious to them than their
neighbor’s welfare. See, for example, how even when they were in
a furnace, they made their supplication for all the people. But we not
even when at large bear our brethren in mind. And again, when they were
inquiring about the dreams,<note n="211" id="iii.IV_1-p108.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p109"><scripRef passage="Dan. ii. 17, 18" id="iii.IV_1-p109.1" parsed="|Dan|2|17|2|18" osisRef="Bible:Dan.2.17-Dan.2.18">Dan. ii.

that they offer nothing more than “a contrite spirit.”<note n="214" id="iii.IV_1-p111.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p112"><scripRef passage="Song of the Three Children, v. 16" id="iii.IV_1-p112.1">Song of the

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p113">19. These men then let us also imitate. Because now too
there is set up a golden image, even the tyranny of Mammon. But let us
not give heed to the timbrels, nor to the flutes, nor to the harps, nor
to the rest of the pomp of riches; yea, though we must needs fall into
a furnace of poverty, let us choose it, rather than worship that idol,

poverty.” For so too at that time they that fell into the furnace
were shewn the more glorious, but they that worshipped were destroyed.

accomplished here, some there, some both here and in the day that is to
come. For they that have chosen poverty, in order that they might not

have been rich unjustly here, shall then pay the utmost penalty.</p>

in the Gospel, however, justifies the interpretation of the passage
given here.—R.]</p></note> For indeed what we have now mentioned was a type of this. Wherefore as
in this instance they who fell into the furnace suffered no hurt, but
they who sat without were laid hold of with great fierceness, so
likewise shall it be then. The saints walking through the river of fire
shall suffer no pain, nay they will even appear joyous; but they that
have worshipped the image, shall see the fire rest upon them fiercer
than any wild beast, and draw them in. So that if any one disbelieves
hell, when he sees this furnace, let him from the things present
believe things to come, and fear not the furnace of poverty, but the
furnace of sin. For this is flame and torment, but that, dew<note n="217" id="iii.IV_1-p116.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p117">[See note 11, (p. 29).—R.]</p></note>and refreshment; and by this stands the devil, by that, angels wafting

the flame, which they have kindled with their own hands.</p>

me.”<note n="221" id="iii.IV_1-p122.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p123"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 35" id="iii.IV_1-p123.1" parsed="|Matt|25|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.35">Matt. xxv.

unto the furnace of poverty; let us behold them that in self-restraint
walk therein, and trample on the burning coals; let us behold the
marvel, strange and beyond thought, a man singing praise in a furnace,
a man giving thanks in fire, chained unto extreme poverty, yet offering
much praise to Christ. Since they, who bear poverty with thankfulness,
really become equal to those children. For no flame is so terrible as
poverty, nor so apt to set us on fire. But those children were not set
on fire; rather, on their giving thanks to the Lord, their bonds too
were at once loosed. So likewise now, if when thou hast fallen into
poverty, thou art thankful, both the bonds are loosened, and the flame
extinguished; or though it be not extinguished (what is much more
marvellous), it becomes a fountain instead of a flame: which then
likewise came to pass, and in the midst of a furnace they enjoyed a
pure dew. For the fire indeed it quenched not, but the burning of those
cast in it altogether hindered. This one may see in their case also who
live by the rules of wisdom,<note n="223" id="iii.IV_1-p124.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p125">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IV_1-p125.1">τν

<p class="c13" id="iii.IV_1-p126">Let us not therefore sit down without the furnace,
feeling no pity towards the poor; lest the same befall us as then
befell those executioners. For if thou shouldest go down to them, and
take thy stand with the children, the fire will no longer work thee any
harm; but if thou shouldest sit above and neglect them in the flame of
their poverty, the flame will burn thee up. Go down therefore into the
fire, that thou mayest not be burnt up by the fire; sit not down
without the fire, lest the flame catch hold of thee. For if it should
find thee amongst the poor, it will depart from thee; but if alienated
from them, it will run upon thee quickly, and catch thee. Do not
therefore stand off from them that are cast in, but when the devil
gives command to cast them that have not worshipped gold into the
furnace of poverty, be not thou of them that cast others in, but of
them that are cast in; that thou mayest be of the number of the saved,
and not of the burned. For indeed it is a most effectual <i>dew</i>, to
be held in no subjection by desire of wealth, to be associate with poor
persons. These are wealthier than all, who have trampled under foot the
desire of riches. Forasmuch as those children too, by despising the
king at that time, became more glorious than the king. And thou
therefore, if thou despise the things of the world, shalt become more
honorable than all the world; like those holy men, “of whom the
world was not worthy.”<note n="224" id="iii.IV_1-p126.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IV_1-p127"><scripRef passage="Heb. xi. 38" id="iii.IV_1-p127.1" parsed="|Heb|11|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.38">Heb. xi.

grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom be glory
and might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

to pass? Let us observe whence it arises. Whence then doth so great a
change in us arise? From the unbecoming employment of our time, and
from the company of evil men. For we ought not as soon as we retire

For a wider use, see the close of Homily LXXXVIII.—R.]</p></note>to plunge into business unsuited to the Communion, but as soon as ever
we get home, to take our Bible into our hands, and call our wife and
children to join us in putting together what we have heard, and then,
not before, engage in the business of life.<note n="226" id="iii.V_1-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p6">Comp. Herbert’s Country Parson, c. 10.

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p7">For if after the bath you would not choose to hurry into
the market place, lest by the business in the market you should destroy
the refreshment thence derived; much more ought we to act on this
principle after the Communion. But as it is, we do the contrary, and in
this very way throw away all. For while the profitable effect of what
hath been said to us is not yet well fixed, the great force of the
things that press upon us from without sweeps all entirely away.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p8">That this then may not be the case, when you retire from
the Communion, you must account nothing more necessary than that you
should put together the things that have been said to you. Yes, for it
were the utmost folly for us, while we give up five and even six days
to the business of this life, not to bestow on things spiritual so much
as one day, or rather not so much as a small part of one day. See ye
not our own children, that whatever lessons are given them, those they
study throughout the whole day? This then let us do likewise, since
otherwise we shall derive no profit from coming here, drawing water
daily into a vessel with holes, and not bestowing on the retaining of
what we have heard even so much earnestness as we plainly show with
respect to gold and silver. For any one who has received a few pence
both puts them into a bag and sets a seal thereon; but we, having given
us oracles more precious than either gold or costly stones, and
receiving the treasures of the Spirit, do not put them away in the
storehouses of our soul, but thoughtlessly and at random suffer them to
escape from our minds. Who then will pity us after all this, plotting
against our own interests, and casting ourselves into so deep poverty?
Therefore, that this may not be so, let us write it down an unalterable
law for ourselves, for our wives, and for our children, to give up this
one day of the week entire to hearing, and to the recollection of the
things we have heard. For thus with greater aptness for learning shall
we approach what is next to be said; and to us the labor will be less,
and to you the profit greater, when, bearing in memory what hath been
lately spoken, ye hearken accordingly to what comes afterwards. For no
little doth this also contribute towards the understanding of what is
said, when ye know accurately the connexion of the thoughts, which we
are busy in weaving together for you. For since it is not possible to
set down all in one day, you must by continued remembrance make the
things laid before you on many days into a kind of chain, and so wrap
it about your soul: that the body of the Scriptures may appear
entire.</p>

Joseph would not have continued thus unshaken, when he heard from him
of a virgin, unless<note n="230" id="iii.V_1-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p15">[“Unless,” is not found in the <span class="c20" id="iii.V_1-p15.1">mss</span>., but inserted by the editors as necessary to
the sense.—R.]</p></note>he had first heard it also from Isaiah. For indeed it was nothing novel
that he was to hear out of the prophets,<note n="231" id="iii.V_1-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p16">[“Prophet” is the correct rendering; the
plural in the Oxford version is probably due to a typographical
error.—R.]</p></note>but what was familiar to him, and had been for a long time the subject
of his meditations. For this cause the angel, to make what he said easy
to be received, brings in Isaiah. And neither here doth he stop, but
connects the discourse with God. For he doth not call the saying
Isaiah’s, but that of the God of all things. For this cause he
said not, “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of
Isaiah,” but “which was spoken of the Lord.” For the
mouth indeed was Isaiah’s, but the oracle was wafted from
above.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p17">3. What then saith this oracle? “Behold, a virgin
shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call
His name Emmanuel.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p18">How was it then, one may say, that His name was not
called Emmanuel, but Jesus Christ? Because he said not, “thou
shalt call,” but “they shall call,” that is, the
multitude, and the issue of events. For here he puts the event as a
name: and this is customary in Scripture, to substitute the events that
take place for names.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p19">Therefore, to say, “they shall call” Him
“Emmanuel,” means nothing else than that they shall see God
amongst men. For He hath indeed always been amongst men, but never so
manifestly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p20">But if Jews are obstinate, we will ask the, when was the
child called, “Make speed to the spoil, hasten the prey?”
Why, they could not say. How is it then that the prophet said,
“Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz?”<note n="232" id="iii.V_1-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p21"><scripRef passage="Isa. viii. 3" id="iii.V_1-p21.1" parsed="|Isa|8|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.8.3">Isa. viii.

the Hebrew name here, but simply repeats a part of the Greek phrase
used to translate “Maher-shalal-hash-baz” in the <span class="c20" id="iii.V_1-p21.2">LXX</span>., which he had already given in the previous

gives this marginal explanation: “That is, <i>The spoil speedeth,
the prey hasteth</i>.”—R.]</p></note> Because, when he was born, there was a taking and dividing of spoils,
therefore the event that took place in his time is put as his name. And
the city, too, it is said, shall be called “the city of
righteousness, the faithful city Sion.”<note n="233" id="iii.V_1-p21.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p22"><scripRef passage="Isa. i. 26, 27" id="iii.V_1-p22.1" parsed="|Isa|1|26|1|27" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.26-Isa.1.27">Isa. i. 26,

“righteousness,” but it continued to be called Jerusalem.
However, inasmuch as this came to pass in fact, when the city underwent
a change for the better, on that account he saith it is so called. For
when any event happens which marks out him who brings it to pass, or
who is benefited by it, more clearly than his name, the Scripture<note n="234" id="iii.V_1-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p23">[Supplied by translator; literally, “it
speaks.”—R.]</p></note>speaks of the truth of the event as being a name to him.</p>

they should seek another, namely, what is said touching Mary’s

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p27">But even if they bring in the testimony of those others,
yet so the tokens of victory would be with us. Because the Scripture is
wont to put the word “youth,” for “virginity;”

said, “young men and maidens, old men with younger
ones.”<note n="237" id="iii.V_1-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p28"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxlviii. 12" id="iii.V_1-p28.1" parsed="|Ps|48|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.48.12">Ps.

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p30">And what goes before also establishes this
interpretation. For he doth not merely say, “Behold, the Virgin
shall be with child,” but having first said, “Behold, the

happened in the way of marriage, what sort of sign would the event be?
For that which is a sign must of course be beyond the course of common
events, it must be strange and extraordinary; else how could it be a
sign?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p32">5. “Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as
the angel of the Lord had bidden him.” Seest thou obedience, and
a submissive mind? Seest thou a soul truly wakened, and in all things
incorruptible? For neither when he suspected something painful or amiss
could he endure to keep the Virgin with him; nor yet, after he was
freed from this suspicion, could he bear to cast her out, but he rather
keeps her with him, and ministers to the whole Dispensation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p33">“And took unto him Mary his wife.” Seest
thou how continually the evangelist uses this word, not willing that
that mystery should be disclosed as yet, and annihilating that evil
suspicion?</p>

suspect that afterwards he did know her, but to inform thee that before
the birth the Virgin was wholly untouched by man. But why then, it may
be said, hath he used the word, “till”? Because it is usual
in Scripture often to do this, and to use this expression without
reference to limited times. For so with respect to the ark likewise, it
is said, “The raven returned not till the earth was dried
up.”<note n="241" id="iii.V_1-p35.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p36"><scripRef passage="Gen. viii. 7" id="iii.V_1-p36.1" parsed="|Gen|8|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.8.7">Gen. viii.

also of God, the Scripture saith, “From age until age Thou
art,”<note n="242" id="iii.V_1-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p37"><scripRef passage="Ps. xc. 2" id="iii.V_1-p37.1" parsed="|Ps|90|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.90.2">Ps. xc.

Gospel beforehand, and saying, “In his days shall righteousness

likewise, it uses the word “till,” to make certain what was
before the birth, but as to what follows, it leaves thee to make the
inference. Thus, what it was necessary for thee to learn of Him, this
He Himself hath said; that the Virgin was untouched by man until the
birth; but that which both was seen to be a consequence of the former
statement, and was acknowledged, this in its turn he leaves for thee to
perceive; namely, that not even after this, she having so become a
mother, and having been counted worthy of a new sort of travail, and a
child-bearing so strange, could that righteous man ever have endured to
know her. For if he had known her, and had kept her in the place of a
wife, how is it that our Lord<note n="244" id="iii.V_1-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p39"><scripRef passage="John xix. 27" id="iii.V_1-p39.1" parsed="|John|19|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.19.27">John xix.

commands him to take her to his own home?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p40">How then, one may say, are James and the others called
His brethren? In the same kind of way as Joseph himself was supposed to
be husband of Mary. For many were the veils provided, that the birth,
being such as it was, might be for a time screened. Wherefore even John
so called them, saying, “For neither did His brethren believe in
Him.”<note n="245" id="iii.V_1-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p41"><scripRef passage="John vii. 5" id="iii.V_1-p41.1" parsed="|John|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.5">John vii.

living, after His death are so filled with awe, as even to die for Him
with exceeding readiness. Such things most of all show the power of His
resurrection. For this, you see, was the reason of the more glorious
things being kept till afterwards, viz. that this proof might become
indisputable. For seeing that even those who are admired amongst us in
their life, when they are gone, are apt to be forgotten by us; how was
it that they, who made light of this Man living, afterwards thought Him
to be God, if He was but one of the many? How was it that they

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p59">For why should we speak of his sister? since he who
stood forth the advocate of so great a people had not power to prevail
for himself, but after his countless toils, and sufferings, and his
assiduity for forty years, was prohibited from setting foot on that
land, touching which there had been so many declarations and promises.
What then was the cause? To grant this favor would not be profitable,
but would, on the contrary, bring with it much harm, and would be sure
to prove a stumbling-block to many of the Jews. For if when they were
merely delivered from Egypt, they forsook God, and sought after Moses,
and imputed all to him; had they seen him also lead them into the land
of promise, to what extent of impiety might they not have been cast
away? And for this reason also, let me add, neither was his tomb made

willing to give His grace to us, than to others for us; that we by
endeavoring ourselves to do away His wrath, may both enjoy confidence

He said, “make to yourselves friends,”<note n="264" id="iii.V_1-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p68"><scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 9" id="iii.V_1-p68.1" parsed="|Luke|16|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.9">Luke xvi.
9</scripRef>. It would seem from this
that the saints whom we are to supplicate for their help are those on
earth, whom we may assist by our alms. And the examples before tend to
confirm this view.</p></note>he did not stop at this only, but He added, “of the unrighteous
mammon;” that so again the good work may be thine own; for it is
nothing else but almsgiving which He hath here signified. And, what is
marvellous, neither doth He make a strict account with us, if we
withdraw ourselves from injustice. For what He saith is like this:
“Hast thou gained ill? spend well. Hast thou gathered by
unrighteousness? scatter abroad in righteousness.” And yet, what
manner of virtue is this, to give out of such gains? God, however,
being full of love to man, condescends even to this and if we thus do,
promises us many good things. But we are so past all feeling, as not to
give even of our unjust gain, but while plundering without end, if we
contribute the smallest part, we think we have fulfilled all. Hast thou
not heard Paul saying, “He which soweth sparingly, shall reap
also sparingly”?<note n="265" id="iii.V_1-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.V_1-p69"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xix. 6" id="iii.V_1-p69.1" parsed="|2Cor|19|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.19.6">2 Cor. xix.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> Wherefore then dost thou spare? What, is the act an outlay? is it an
expense? Nay, it is gain and good merchandise. Where there is
merchandise, there is also increase; where there is sowing, there is
also reaping. But thou, if thou hadst to till a rich and deep soil, and
capable of receiving much seed, wouldest both spend what thou hadst,
and wouldest borrow of other men, accounting parsimony in such cases to
be loss; but, when it is Heaven which thou art to cultivate, which is
exposed to no variation of weather, and will surely repay thine outlay
with abundant increase, thou art slow and backward, and considerest not
that it is possible by sparing to lose, and by not sparing to gain.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p70">9. Disperse therefore, that thou mayest not lose; keep
not, that thou mayest keep; lay out, that thou mayest save; spend, that
thou mayest gain. If thy treasures are to be hoarded, do not thou hoard
them, for thou wilt surely cast them away; but entrust them to God, for
thence no man makes spoil of them. Do not thou traffic, for thou
knowest not at all how to gain; but lend unto Him who gives an interest
greater than the principal. Lend, where is no envy, no accusation, nor
evil design, nor fear. Lend unto Him who wants nothing, yet hath need
for thy sake; who feeds all men, yet is an hungered, that thou mayest
not suffer famine; who is poor, that thou mayest be rich. Lend there,
where thy return cannot be death, but life instead of death. For this
usury is the harbinger of a kingdom, that, of hell; the one coming of
covetousness, the other of self-denial; the one of cruelty, the other
of humanity. What excuse then will be ours, when having the power to
receive more, and that with security, and in due season, and in great
freedom, without either reproaches, or fears, or dangers, we let go
these gains, and follow after that other sort, base and vile as they
are, insecure and perishable, and greatly aggravating the furnace for
us? For nothing, nothing is baser than the usury of this world, nothing
more cruel. Why, other persons’ calamities are such a man’s
traffic; he makes himself gain of the distress of another, and demands
wages for kindness, as though he were afraid to seem merciful, and
under the cloak of kindness he digs the pitfall deeper, by the act of
help galling a man’s poverty, and in the act of stretching out
the hand thrusting him down, and when receiving him as in harbor,
involving him in shipwreck, as on a rock, or shoal, or reef.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.V_1-p71">“But what dost thou require?” saith one;
“that I should give another for his use that money which I have
got together, and which is to me useful, and demand no
recompense?” Far from it: I say not this: yea, I earnestly desire
that thou shouldest have a recompense; not however a mean nor small
one, but far greater; for in return for gold, I would that thou
shouldest receive Heaven for usury. Why then shut thyself up in
poverty, crawling about the earth, and demanding little for great? Nay,
this is the part of one who knows not how to be rich. For when God in
return for a little money is promising thee

<pb n="34" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_34.html" id="iii.V_1-Page_34" />

the good things that are in Heaven, and thou sayest,
“Give me not Heaven, but instead of Heaven the gold that
perisheth,” this is for one who wishes to continue in poverty.
Even as he surely who desires wealth and abundance will choose things
abiding rather than things perishing; the inexhaustible, rather than
such as waste away; much rather than little, the incorruptible rather
than the corruptible. For so the other sort too will follow. For as he
who seeks earth before Heaven, will surely lose earth also, so he that
prefers Heaven to earth, shall enjoy both in great excellency. And that
this may be the case with us, let us despise all things here, and
choose the good things to come. For thus shall we obtain both the one
and the other, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ; to whom be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.VI_1-p3">“When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in
the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east
to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we
have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.VI_1-p4">We have need of much wakefulness, and many prayers, that
we may arrive at the interpretation of the passage now before us, and
that we may learn who these wise men were, and whence they came, and
how; and at whose persuasion, and what was the star. Or rather, if ye
will, let us first bring forward what the enemies of the truth say.
Because the devil hath blown upon them with so violent a blast, as even
from this passage try to arm them against the words of truth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p5">What then do they allege? “Behold,” say
they, “even when Christ was born a star appeared; which is a sign
that astrology may be depended on.” How then, if He had His birth
according to that law, did He put down astrology, and take away fate,
and stop the mouths of demons, and cast out error, and overthrow all
such sorcery?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p6">And what moreover do the wise men learn from the star of
itself? That He was King of the Jews? And yet He was not king of this
kingdom; even as He said also to Pilate, “My kingdom is not of
this world.” At any rate He made no display of this kind, for He
had neither guards armed with spear or shield, nor horses, nor chariots
of mules, nor any other such thing around Him; but He followed this
life of meanness and poverty, carrying about with Him twelve men of
mean estate.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p7">And even if they knew Him to be a king, for what intent
are they come? For surely this is not the business of astrology, to
know from the stars who are born, but from the hour when men are born
to predict what shall befall them: so it is said. But these were
neither present with the mother in her pangs, nor did they know the
time when He was born, neither did they, beginning at that moment, from
the motion of the stars compute what was to happen: but conversely,
having a long time before seen a star appear in their own country, they
come to see Him that was born.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p8">Which circumstance in itself would afford a still
greater difficulty even than the former. For what reason induced them,
or the hope of what benefits, to worship one who was king so far off?
Why, had He been to reign over themselves, most assuredly not even so
would the circumstance be capable of a reasonable account. To be sure,
if He had been born in royal courts, and with His father, himself a
king, present by Him, any one would naturally say, that they, from a
wish to pay court to the father, had worshipped the child that was
born, and in this way were laying up for themselves beforehand much
ground of patronage. But now when they did not so much as expect Him to
be their own king, but of a strange nation, far distant from their
country, neither seeing Him as yet grown to manhood; wherefore do they
set forth on so long a journey, and offer gifts, and this when dangers
were sure to

<pb n="35" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_35.html" id="iii.VI_1-Page_35" />

beset their whole
proceeding? For both Herod, when he heard it, was exceedingly troubled,
and the whole people was confounded on being told of these things by
them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p9">“But these men did not foresee this.” Nay,
this is not reasonable. For let them have been ever so foolish, of this
they could not be ignorant, that when they came to a city under a king,
and proclaimed such things as these, and set forth another king besides
him who then reigned, they must needs be bringing down on themselves a
thousand deaths.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p10">2. And why did they at all worship one who was in
swaddling clothes? For if He had been a grown man, one might say, that
in expectation of the succor they should receive from Him, they cast
themselves into a danger which they foresaw; a thing however to the
utmost degree unreasonable, that the Persian, the barbarian, and one
that had nothing in common with the nation of the Jews, should be
willing to depart from his home, to give up country, and kindred, and
friends, and that they should subject themselves to another
kingdom.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p11">But if this be foolish, what follows is much more
foolish. Of what nature then is this? That after they had entered on so
long a journey, and worshipped, and thrown all into confusion, they
went away immediately. And what sign at all of royalty did they behold,
when they saw a shed, and a manger, and a child in swaddling clothes,
and a poor mother? And to whom moreover did they offer their gifts, and
for what intent? Was it then usual and customary, thus to pay court to
the kings that were born in every place? and did they always keep going
about the whole world, worshipping them who they knew should become
kings out of a low and mean estate, before they ascended the royal
throne? Nay, this no one can say.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p12">And for what purpose did they worship Him at all? If for
the sake of things present, then what did they expect to receive from
an infant, and a mother of mean condition? If for things future, then
whence did they know that the child whom they had worshipped in
swaddling clothes would remember what was then done? But if His mother
was to remind Him, not even so were they worthy of honor, but of
punishment, as bringing Him into danger which they must have foreseen.
Thence at any rate it was that Herod was troubled, and sought, and
pried, and took in hand to slay Him. And indeed everywhere, he who
makes known the future king, supposing him in his earliest age in a
private condition, doth nothing else than betray him to slaughter, and
kindle against him endless warfare.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p13">Seest thou how manifold the absurdities appear, if we
examine these transactions according to the course of human things and
ordinary custom? For not these topics only, but more than these might
be mentioned, containing more matter for questions than what we have
spoken of. But lest, stringing questions upon questions, we should
bewilder you, come let us now enter upon the solution of the matters
inquired of, making a beginning of our solution with the star
itself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p14">3. For if ye can learn what the star was, and of what
kind, and whether it were one of the common stars, or new and unlike
the rest, and whether it was a star by nature or a star in appearance
only, we shall easily know the other things also. Whence then will
these points be manifest? From the very things that are written. Thus,
that this star was not of the common sort, or rather not a star at all,
as it seems at least to me, but some invisible power transformed into
this appearance, is in the first place evident from its very course.
For there is not, there is not any star that moves by this way, but
whether it be the sun you mention, or the moon, or all the other stars,
we see them going from east to west; but this was wafted from north to
south; for so is Palestine situated with respect to Persia.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p15">In the second place, one may see this from the time
also. For it appears not in the night, but in mid-day, while the sun is
shining; and this is not within the power of a star, nay not of the
moon; for the moon that so much surpasses all, when the beams of the
sun appear, straightway hides herself, and vanishes away. But this by
the excess of its own splendor overcame even the beams of the sun,
appearing brighter than they, and in so much light shining out more
illustriously.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p16">In the third place, from its appearing, and hiding
itself again. For on their way as far as Palestine it appeared leading
them, but after they set foot within Jerusalem, it hid itself: then
again, when they had left Herod, having told him on what account they
came, and were on the point of departing, it shows itself; all which is
not like the motion of a star, but of some power highly endued with
reason. For it had not even any course at all of its own, but when they
were to move, it moved; when to stand, it stood, dispensing<note n="266" id="iii.VI_1-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p17"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VI_1-p17.1">οκονομν</span>.</p></note>all as need required: in the same kind of way as the pillar of the
cloud, now halting

<pb n="36" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_36.html" id="iii.VI_1-Page_36" />

and now rousing
up the camp of the Jews, when it was needful.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p18">In the fourth place, one may perceive this clearly, from
its mode of pointing Him out. For it did not, remaining on high, point
out the place; it not being possible for them so to ascertain it, but
it came down and performed this office. For ye know that a spot of so
small dimensions, being only as much as a shed would occupy, or rather
as much as the body of a little infant would take up, could not
possibly be marked out by a star. For by reason of its immense height,
it could not sufficiently distinguish so confined a spot, and discover
it to them that were desiring to see it. And this any one may see by
the moon, which being so far superior to the stars, seems to all that
dwell in the world, and are scattered over so great an extent of
earth,—seems, I say, near to them every one. How then, tell me,
did the star point out a spot so confined, just the space of a manger
and shed, unless it left that height and came down, and stood over the
very head of the young child? And at this the evangelist was hinting
when he said, “Lo, the star went before them, till it came and
stood over where the young Child was.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p19">4. Seest thou, by what store of proofs this star is
shown not to be one of the many, nor to have shown itself according to
the order of the outward creation? And for what intent did it appear?
To reprove the Jews for their insensibility, and to cut off from them
all occasion of excuse for their willful ignorance. For, since He who
came was to put an end to the ancient polity, and to call the world to
the worship of Himself, and to be worshipped in all land and sea,
straightway, from the beginning, He opens the door to the Gentiles,
willing through strangers to admonish His own people. Thus, because the
prophets were continually heard speaking of His advent, and they gave
no great heed, He made even barbarians come from a far country, to seek
after the king that was among them. And they learn from a Persian
tongue first of all, what they would not submit to learn from the
prophets; that, if on the one hand they were disposed to be candid,
they might have the strongest motive for obedience; if, on the other
hand, they were contentious, they might henceforth be deprived of all
excuse. For what could they have to say, who did not receive Christ
after so many prophets, when they saw that wise men, at the sight of a
single star, had received this same, and had worshipped Him who was
made manifest. Much in the same way then as He acted in the case of the
Ninevites, when He sent Jonas, and as in the case of the Samaritan and
the Canaanitish women; so He did likewise in the instance of the magi.
For this cause He also said, “The men of Nineveh shall rise up,
and shall condemn:” and, “the Queen of the South shall rise
up, and shall condemn this generation:”<note n="267" id="iii.VI_1-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 41, 42" id="iii.VI_1-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|12|41|12|42" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.41-Matt.12.42">Matt. xii.
41, 42</scripRef>.</p></note>because these believed the lesser things, but the Jews not even the
greater.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p21">“And wherefore,” one may say, “did He
attract them by such a vision?” Why, how should He have done?
Sent prophets? But the magi would not have submitted to prophets.
Uttered a voice from above? Nay, they would not have attended. Sent an
angel? But even him they would have hurried by. And so for this cause
dismissing all those means, God calleth them by the things that are
familiar, in exceeding condescension; and He shows a large and
extraordinary star, so as to astonish them, both at the greatness and
beauty of its appearance, and the manner of its course.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p22">In imitation of this, Paul also reasons with the Greeks
from an heathen altar, and brings forward testimonies from the
poets.<note n="268" id="iii.VI_1-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p23"><scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 23, 28; 1 Cor. xv. 33; Titus i. 12" id="iii.VI_1-p23.1" parsed="|Acts|17|23|0|0;|Acts|17|28|0|0;|1Cor|15|33|0|0;|Titus|1|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.23 Bible:Acts.17.28 Bible:1Cor.15.33 Bible:Titus.1.12">Acts xvii.
23, 28; 1 Cor. xv. 33; Titus i. 12</scripRef>.</p></note> And not without circumcision doth he harangue the Jews. Sacrifices he
makes the beginning of his instruction to them that are living under
the law. For, since to every one what is familiar is dear, both God,
and the men that are sent by Him, manage things on this principle with
a view to the salvation of the world. Think it not therefore unworthy
of Him to have called them by a star; since by the same rule thou wilt
find fault with all the Jewish rites also, the sacrifices, and the
purifications, and the new moons, and the ark, and the temple too
itself. For even these derived their origin from Gentile grossness.<note n="269" id="iii.VI_1-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p24">See St. Iren. iv. 28, 29; Tertull. adv. Marc. i. 18,
22; St. Chrys. adv. Jud. Hom. i. t. 6, 318.</p></note> Yet for all that, God, for the salvation of them that were in error,
endured to be served by these things, whereby those without were used
to serve devils; only He slightly altered them; that He might draw them
off by degrees from their customs, and lead them towards the highest
wisdom. Just so He did in the case of the wise men also, not disdaining
to call them by sight of a star, that He might lift them higher ever
after. Therefore after He hath brought them, leading them by the hand,
and hath set them by the manger; it is no longer by a star, but by an
angel that He now discourses unto them. Thus did they by little and
little become better men.</p>

<pb n="37" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_37.html" id="iii.VI_1-Page_37" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p25">This did He also with respect to them of Ascalon, and of
Gaza. For those five cities too (when at the coming of the ark they had
been smitten with a deadly plague, and found no deliverance from the
ills under which they lay)—the men of them called their prophets,
and gathered an assembly, and sought to discover an escape from this
divine scourge. Then, when their prophets said that they should yoke to
the ark heifers untamed, and having their first calves, and let them go
their way, with no man to guide them, for so it would be evident
whether the plague was from God or whether it was any accident which
brought the disease;—(“for if,” it is said,
“they break the yoke in pieces for want of practice, or turn
where their calves are lowing, ‘it is a chance that hath
happened;’<note n="270" id="iii.VI_1-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p26"><scripRef passage="1 Sam. vi. 9" id="iii.VI_1-p26.1" parsed="|1Sam|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.6.9">1 Sam. vi.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>but if they go on right, and err not from the way, and neither the
lowing of their young, nor their ignorance of the way, have any effect
on them, it is quite plain that it is the hand of God that hath visited
those cities:”)—when, I say, on these words of their
prophets the inhabitants of those cities obeyed and did as they were
commanded, God also followed up the counsel of the prophets, showing
condescension in that instance also, and counted it not unworthy of
Himself to bring to effect the prediction of the prophets, and to make
them seem trustworthy in what they had then said. For so the good
achieved was greater, in that His very enemies themselves bore witness
to the power of God; yea, their own teachers gave their voice
concerning Him. And one may see many other such things brought about by
God. For what took place with respect to the witch,<note n="271" id="iii.VI_1-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p27"><scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxviii" id="iii.VI_1-p27.1" parsed="|1Sam|28|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.28">1 Sam.
xxviii</scripRef>.</p></note>is again like this sort of dispensation; which circumstance also you
will now be able to explain from what hath been said.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p28">With respect to the star, we have said these things, and
yet more perhaps may be said by you; for, it is said, “Give
occasion to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:”<note n="272" id="iii.VI_1-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p29"><scripRef passage="Prov. ix. 9" id="iii.VI_1-p29.1" parsed="|Prov|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.9.9">Prov. ix.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>but we must now come to the beginning of what hath been read.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p30">5. And what is the beginning? “When Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judæa, in the days of Herod the king, behold,
there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.” While wise men
followed under the auspices of a star, these believed not, with
prophets even sounding in their ears. But wherefore doth he mention to
us both the time and the place, saying, “in Bethlehem,” and
“in the days of Herod the king?” And for what reason doth
he add his rank also? His rank, because there was also another Herod,
he who slew John: but that was a tetrarch, this a king. And the place
likewise, and the time, he puts down, to bring to our remembrance
ancient prophecies; whereof one was uttered by Micah, saying,
“And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art by no means the
least among the princes of Judah;”<note n="273" id="iii.VI_1-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p31"><scripRef passage="Micah v. 2" id="iii.VI_1-p31.1" parsed="|Mic|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mic.5.2">Micah v.
2</scripRef>.</p></note>and the other by the patriarch Jacob, distinctly marking out to us the
time, and setting forth the great sign of His coming. For, “A
ruler,” saith he, “shall not fail out of Judah, nor a
leader out of his loins, until He come for whom it is appointed, and He
is the expectation of the Gentiles.”<note n="274" id="iii.VI_1-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p32"><scripRef passage="Gen. xlix. 10" id="iii.VI_1-p32.1" parsed="|Gen|49|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.49.10">Gen. xlix.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p33">And this again is worth inquiry, whence it was that they
came to entertain such a thought, and who it was that stirred them up
to this. For it doth not seem to me to be the work of the star only,
but also of God, who moved their soul; which same kind of thing He did
also in the case of Cyrus, disposing him to let the Jews go. He did not
however so do this as to destroy their free will, since even when He
called Paul from above by a voice, He manifested both His own grace and
Paul’s obedience.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p34">And wherefore, one may ask, did He not reveal this to
all the wise men of the East? Because all would not have believed, but
these were better prepared than the rest; since also there were
countless nations that perished, but it was to the Ninevites only that
the prophet was sent; and there were two thieves on the cross, but one
only was saved. See at least the virtue of these men, not only by their
coming, but also by their boldness of speech. For so that they may not
seem to be a sort of impostors,<note n="275" id="iii.VI_1-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p35"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VI_1-p35.1">ὑποβολιμαοι
τινε</span>.</p></note>they tell who showed them the way, and the length of their journey; and
being come, they had boldness of speech: “for we are come,”
that is their statement, “to worship Him:” and they were
afraid neither of the people’s anger, nor of the tyranny of the
king. Whence to me at least they seem to have been at home also
teachers of their countrymen.<note n="276" id="iii.VI_1-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p36">So in Op. Imperf. in Matt. Hom. 2. “After

instructed many by their preaching. And at last, when Thomas had gone
into that province, they joined themselves to him and were baptized,
and became doers of his word.” This work has been attributed to
St. Chrysostom, and seems certainly of the same date with him.</p></note> For they who here did not shrink from saying this, much more would they
speak boldly in their own country, as having received both the oracle
from the angel, and the testimony from the prophet.</p>

king, and afraid both for himself and for his children; but why
Jerusalem? Surely the prophets had foretold Him a Saviour, and
Benefactor, and a Deliverer from above. Wherefore then was
Jerusalem<note n="277" id="iii.VI_1-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p38">[Literally, “were they.”—R.]</p></note>troubled? From the same feeling which caused them before also to turn

be for burning, for fuel of fire.” This opposes entirely the

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p42">But nevertheless, although troubled, they seek not to
see what hath happened, neither do they follow the wise men, nor make
any particular inquiry; to such a degree were they at once both
contentious and careless above all men. For when they had reason rather
to pride themselves that the king was born amongst them, and had
attracted to Him the land of the Persians, and they were on the point
of having all subject to them, as though their affairs had advanced
towards improvement, and from the very outset His empire had become so
glorious; nevertheless, they do not even for this become better. And
yet they were but just delivered from their captivity there; and it was
natural for them to think (even if they knew none of those things that
are high and mysterious, but formed their judgment from what is present
only), “If they thus tremble before our king at His birth, much
more when grown up will they fear and obey Him, and our estate will be
more glorious than that of the barbarians.”</p>

that are evil pass this judgment, consider what sentence she obtained

pray thee, art thou luxurious and dissolute, while thou art still

give account, dost thou sit laughing and talking wittily, and giving
thyself up to luxury? “Why,” one may say, “if I did
not so, but mourned, what would be the profit?” Very great
indeed; even so great, as it is not possible so much as to set it forth
by word. For while, before the temporal tribunals, be thy weeping ever
so abundant, thou canst not escape punishment after the sentence; here,
on the contrary, shouldest thou only sigh, thou hast annulled the
sentence, and hast obtained pardon. Therefore it is that Christ
discourses to us much of mourning, and blesses them that mourn, and
pronounces them that laugh wretched. For this is not the theatre for
laughter, neither did we come together for this intent, that we may
give way to immoderate mirth, but that we may groan, and by this
groaning inherit a kingdom. But thou, when standing by a

king, dost not endure so much as merely to
smile; having then the Lord of the angels dwelling in thee, dost thou
not stand with trembling, and all due self-restraint, but rather
laughest, oftentimes when He is displeased? And dost thou not consider
that thou provokest Him in this way more than by thy sins? For God is
not wont to turn Himself away so much from them that sin, as from those
that are not awestruck after their sin.</p>

it is not God that grants to play, but the devil. At least hear, what
was the portion of them that played. “The people,” it is

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p65">10. It becometh not us then to be continually laughing,
and to be dissolute, and luxurious, but it belongs to those upon the
stage, the harlot women, the men that are trimmed for this intent,
parasites, and flatterers; not them that are called unto heaven, not
them that are enrolled into the city above, not them that bear
spiritual arms, but them that are enlisted on the devil’s side.
For it is he, yea, it is he, that even made the thing an art, that he
might weaken Christ’s soldiers, and soften the nerves of their
zeal. For this cause he also built theatres in the cities, and having
trained those buffoons, by their pernicious influence he causes that
kind of pestilence to light upon the whole city, persuading men to
follow those things which Paul bade us flee, “foolish talking and
jesting.”<note n="295" id="iii.VI_1-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p66"><scripRef passage="Eph. v. 4" id="iii.VI_1-p66.1" parsed="|Eph|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.4">Eph. v.

laughter. For when they that act those absurd things utter any word of
blasphemy or filthiness, then many among the more thoughtless laugh and
are pleased, applauding in them what they ought to stone them for; and
drawing down on their own heads by this amusement the furnace of fire.
For they who praise the utterers of such words, it is these above all
who induce men so to speak: wherefore they must be more justly
accountable for the penalty allotted to these things. For were there no
one to be a spectator in such cases, neither would there be one to act;
but when they see you forsaking your workshops, and your crafts, and
your income from these, and in short everything, for the sake of
continuing there, they derive hence a greater forwardness, and exert a
greater diligence about these things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p67">And this I say, not freeing them from reproof, but that
ye may learn that it is you chiefly who supply the principle and root
of such lawlessness; ye who consume your whole day on these matters,
and profanely exhibit the sacred things of marriage, and make an open
mock of the great mystery. For not even he who acts these things is so
much the offender, as thou art before him; thou who biddest him make a
play on these things, or rather who not only biddest him, but art even
zealous about it, taking delight, and laughing, and praising what is
done, and in every way gaining strength for such workshops of the
devil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p68">Tell me then, with what eyes wilt thou after this look
upon thy wife at home, having seen her insulted there? Or how dost thou
not blush being put in mind of the partner of thy home, when thou seest
nature herself put to an open shame? Nay, tell me not, that what is
done is acting; for this acting hath made many adulterers, and
subverted many families. And it is for this most especially that I
grieve, that what is done doth not so much as seem evil, but there is
even applause and clamor, and much laughter, at

<pb n="41" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_41.html" id="iii.VI_1-Page_41" />

commission of so foul adultery. What sayest
thou? that what is done is acting? Why, for this selfsame reason they
must be worthy of ten thousand deaths, that what things all laws
command men to flee, they have taken pains to imitate. For if the thing
itself be bad, the imitation thereof also is bad. And I do not yet say
how many adulterers they make who act these scenes of adultery, how
they render the spectators of such things bold and shameless; for
nothing is more full of whoredom and boldness than an eye that endures
to look at such things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VI_1-p69">And thou in a market-place wouldest not choose to see a
woman stripped naked, or rather not even in a house, but callest such a
thing an outrage. And goest thou up into the theatre, to insult the
common nature of men and women, and disgrace thine own eyes? For say
not this, that she that is stripped is an harlot; but that the nature
is the same, and they are bodies alike, both that of the harlot, and
that of the free-woman. For if this be nothing amiss, what is the cause
that if thou were to see this done in a market place, thou wouldest
both hasten away thyself, and drive thence her who was behaving herself
unseemly? Or is it that when we are apart, then such a thing is
outrageous, but when we are assembled and all sitting together, it is
no longer equally shameful? Nay, this is absurdity and a disgrace, and
words of the utmost madness; and it were better to besmear the eyes all
over with mud and mire than to be a spectator of such a transgression.
For surely mire is not so much an hurt to an eye, as an unchaste sight,
and the spectacle of a woman stripped naked. Hear, for example, what it
was that caused nakedness at the beginning, and read the occasion of
such disgrace. What then did cause nakedness? Our disobedience,<note n="296" id="iii.VI_1-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VI_1-p70">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VI_1-p70.1">῾Η᾽ παρακο</span>,

.</p></note> For both the barbarians and the Jews do the same time alike learn
something more of one another, and teach one another. Thus the Jews,
for their part, heard from the wise men, that a star also had
proclaimed Him in the land of the Persians; the wise men, in their
turn, were informed by the Jews that this Man, whom the star
proclaimed, prophets also had made known from a long time of old. And
the ground<note n="301" id="iii.VII-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p7"><i>i.e</i>, Their assuming that the Christ should be
born at that time.</p></note>of their inquiry was made to both an occasion of setting forth clearer
and more perfect instruction; and the enemies of the truth are
compelled even against their will to read the writings in favor of the
truth, and to interpret the prophecy; although not all of it. For
having spoken of Bethlehem, and how that out of it He shall come that
should rule Israel, they proceed not afterwards to add what follows,
out of flattery to the king. And what was this? That “His goings
forth are from of old, from everlasting.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p8">2. “But why,” one may say, “if He was
to come from thence, did He live in Nazareth after the birth, and
obscure the prophecy?” Nay, He did not obscure it, but unfolded
it the more. For the fact, that while His mother had her constant
residence in the one place, He was born in the other, shows the thing
to have been done by a Divine dispensation.<note n="302" id="iii.VII-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p9"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p9.1">ἐξ
οκονομα</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p10">And for this cause, let me add, neither did He remove
from thence straightway after His birth, but abode forty days, giving
opportunity to them that were disposed to be inquisitive to examine all
things accurately. Because there were in truth many things to move them
to such an inquiry, at least if they had been disposed to give heed to
them. Thus at the coming of the wise men the whole city was in a
flutter,<note n="303" id="iii.VII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p11"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p11.1">ἀνεπτρωθη</span>.</p></note>and together with the city the king, and the prophet was brought
forward, and a court of high authority was summoned; and many other
things too were done there, all which Luke relates minutely. Such were
what concerns Anna, and Simeon, and Zacharias, and the angels, and the
shepherds; all which things were to the attentive sufficient to give
hints for ascertaining what had taken place. For if the wise men, who
came from Persia, were not ignorant of the place, much more might they,
whose abode it was, acquaint themselves with these things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p12">He manifested Himself then from the beginning by many
miracles, but when they would not see, He hid Himself for a while, to
be again revealed from another more glorious beginning. For it was no
longer the wise men, nor the star, but the Father from above that
proclaimed Him at the streams of Jordan; and the Spirit likewise came
upon Him, guiding that voice to the head of Him just baptized; and
John, with all plainness of speech, cried out everywhere in Judæa,
till inhabited and waste country alike were filled with that kind of
doctrine; and the witness too of the miracles, and earth, and sea, and
the whole creation, uttered in His behalf a distinct voice. But at the
time of the birth, just so many things happened as were fitted quietly
to mark out Him that was come. Thus, in order that the Jews might not
say, “We know not when He was born, nor whereabouts,” both
all these events in which the wise men were concerned were brought
about by God’s providence, and the rest of the things which we
have mentioned; so that they would have no excuse to plead, for not
having inquired into that which had come to pass.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p13">But mark also the exactness of the prophecy. For it does
not say, “He will <i>abide</i>” in Bethlehem, but “He
will <i>come out</i>” thence. So that this too was a subject of
prophecy, His being simply born there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p14">Some of them, however, being past shame, say that these
things were spoken of Zerubbabel. But how can they be right? For surely
“his goings forth” were not “from of old, from
everlasting.”<note n="304" id="iii.VII-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p15"><scripRef passage="Micah v. 2" id="iii.VII-p15.1" parsed="|Mic|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mic.5.2">Micah v.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> And how can that suit him which is said at the beginning, “Out of
thee shall He come forth:” Zorobabel not having been born in
Judæa, but in Babylon, whence also he was called Zorobabel,<note n="305" id="iii.VII-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p16">St. Jerome, de Nom. Hebr. t. 3, 77, ed. Venet. 1767.
<i>“Zorobabel, ‘princeps vel magister Babylonis’,
sive ‘aliena translatio,’ vel ‘ortus in
Babylone.’”</i></p></note>because he had his origin there? And as many as know the Syrians’
language know what I say.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p17">And together with what hath been said, all the time also
since these things is sufficient to establish the testimony. For what
saith he? “Thou art not the

<pb n="43" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_43.html" id="iii.VII-Page_43" />

least among the princes of Judah,” and he
adds the cause of the pre-eminence, saying, “out of thee shall He
come.” But no one else hath made that place illustrious or
eminent, excepting Him alone. For example: since that birth, men come
from the ends of the earth to see the manger, and the site of the shed.
And this the prophet foretold aloud from the first, saying, “Thou
art not the least among the princes of Judah;” that is, among the
heads of tribes. By which expression he comprehended even
Jerusalem.<note n="306" id="iii.VII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p18"><i>i.e</i>. He made Bethlehem so far greater than
Jerusalem: because “not the least” seems here equivalent to
“the greatest.”</p></note> But not even so have they given heed, although the advantage passes on
to themselves. Yea, and because of this the prophets at the beginning
discourse nowhere so much of His dignity, as touching the benefit which
accrued to them by Him. For so, when the Virgin was bearing the child,
he saith, “Thou shalt call His name Jesus;”<note n="307" id="iii.VII-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p19"><scripRef passage="Matt. i. 21" id="iii.VII-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|1|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.21">Matt. i.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>and he gives the reason saying, “for He shall save His people
from their sins.” And the wise men too said not, “Where is
the Son of God?” but “He that is born King of the
Jews.” And here again it is not affirmed, “Out of thee
shall come forth” the Son of God, but “a Governor, that
shall feed my people Israel.”<note n="308" id="iii.VII-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p20">[The R.V. renders more accurately: “Which
shall be shepherd of my people Israel.”—R.]</p></note> For it was needful to converse with them at first, setting out in a
tone of very exceeding condescension, lest they should be offended; and
to preach what related to their salvation in particular, that hereby
they might be the rather won over. At any rate, all the testimonies
that are first cited, and for which it was the season immediately at
the time of the birth, say nothing great, nor lofty concerning Him, nor
such as those subsequent to the manifestation of the miracles; for
these discourse more distinctly concerning His dignity. For instance,
when after many miracles children were singing hymns unto Him, hear
what saith the prophet, “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
Thou hast perfected praise.”<note n="309" id="iii.VII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 16; Ps. viii. 2" id="iii.VII-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|21|16|0|0;|Ps|8|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.16 Bible:Ps.8.2">Matt. xxi.

fingers;” which signifies Him to be Maker of the universe. And
the testimony too, which was produced after the ascension, manifests
His equality with the Father; thus saying, “The Lord said unto my
Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.”<note n="310" id="iii.VII-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p22"><scripRef passage="Ps. cx. 1; Acts ii. 34" id="iii.VII-p22.1" parsed="|Ps|10|1|0|0;|Acts|2|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.10.1 Bible:Acts.2.34">Ps. cx. 1;

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p24">But how saith he that Bethlehem is “not the least
among the princes of Judah?” for not in Palestine alone, but in
the whole world, the village hath become conspicuous. Why, so far he
was speaking to Jews; wherefore also he added, “He shall feed my
people Israel.” And yet He fed the whole world; but as I have
said, He is fain not to offend as yet, by revealing what He hath to say
touching the Gentiles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p25">But how was it, one may say, that He did not feed the
Jewish people? I answer, first, this too is accomplished: for by the
term Israel in this place, he figuratively meant such as believed on
Him from among the Jews. And Paul interpreting this, saith, “For
they are not all Israel, which are of Israel,”<note n="312" id="iii.VII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p26"><scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 6" id="iii.VII-p26.1" parsed="|Rom|9|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.6">Rom. ix.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>but as many as have been born by faith and promise. And if He did not
feed them all, this is their own fault and blame. For when they ought
to have worshipped with the wise men, and have glorified God that such
a time was come, doing away all their sins (for not a word was spoken
to them of judgments set, or of accounts to be given, but of a mild and
meek Shepherd); they for their part do just the contrary, and are
troubled, and make disturbance, and go on continually framing plots
without end.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p27">3. “Then Herod, when he had privily called the
wise men, inquired of them diligently<note n="313" id="iii.VII-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p28">[R.V. “learned of them carefully” (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p28.1">ἠ<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p28.2">κρβωσεν παρ

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p30">Attempting to slay that which was born,—an act of
extreme idiotcy<note n="315" id="iii.VII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p31"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p31.1">ἀνοα</span>. [Rendered “folly,”
“extreme folly,” etc., below.—R.]</p></note>not of madness only; since what had been said and done was enough to
have withholden him from any such attempt. For those occurrences were
not after the manner of man. A star, I mean, calling the wise men from
on high; and barbarians making so long a pilgrimage, to worship Him
that lay in swaddling clothes and a manger; and prophets too from of
old, proclaiming beforehand all this;—these and all the rest were
more than human events: but nevertheless, none of these things
restrained him. For such a thing is wickedness. It falls foul of
itself, and is ever attempting impossibilities. And mark his utter
folly. If on the one hand he believed the prophecy, and accounted it to
be unchangeable, it was quite clear that he was attempting
impossibilities; if again he disbelieved, and did not expect that those
sayings would come to pass, he need not have been in fear and alarm,
nor have formed any plot on that behalf. So that in either way his
craft was superfluous.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p32">And this too came of the utmost folly, to think that the
wise men would make more account of him than of the Child that was
born, for the sake of which they had come so long a journey. For if,
before they saw, they were so inflamed with longing for Him;

<pb n="44" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_44.html" id="iii.VII-Page_44" />

after they had seen with their eyes, and
been confirmed by the prophecy, how hoped he to persuade them to betray
the young Child to him?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p33">Nevertheless, many as were the reasons to withhold him,
he made the attempt; and having “privily called the wise men, he
inquired of them.”<note n="316" id="iii.VII-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p34">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p34.1">ἐπυνθνετο
παρ ατν</span>, a paraphrase of the New
Testament passage, a trace of which appears in the A.V.—R.]</p></note> Because he thought that Jews would be concerned in favor of the Child,
and he never could expect that they would fall away unto such madness
as to be willing to give up to His enemies their Protector and Saviour,
and Him who was come for the deliverance of their nation. On account of
this he both calls them privily, and seeks the time not of the Child,
but of the star: thereby marking out the object of his chase so as to
include far more than it.<note n="317" id="iii.VII-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p35"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p35.1">ἐκ

out of great superfluity,” is the more literal rendering. The
sense seems to be, “including more than was necessary that he
might certainly include his prey.”—R.]</p></note> For the star, I think, must have appeared a long time before. It was a
long time which the wise men had to spend on their journey. In order,
therefore, that they might present themselves just after His birth (it
being meet for Him to be worshipped in His very swaddling clothes, that
the marvellous and strange nature of the thing might appear), the star,
a long time before, makes itself visible. Whereas if at the moment of
His birth in Palestine, and not before, it had been seen by them in the
East, they, consuming a long time in their journey, would not have seen
Him in swaddling clothes on their arrival. As to his slaying the
children “from two years old and under,” let us not marvel;
for his wrath and dread, for the sake of a fuller security, added very
much to the time, so that not one might escape.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p36">Having therefore called them, he saith, “Go and
search diligently<note n="318" id="iii.VII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p37">[“Search out carefully,” R.V. The Greek
text of the New Testament is accurately cited.—R.]</p></note>for the young Child; and when ye have found Him, bring me word again,
that I may come and worship Him also.”<note n="319" id="iii.VII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. ii. 8" id="iii.VII-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.2.8">Matt. ii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p39">Seest thou his extreme folly? Why, if thou sayest these
things in sincerity, wherefore dost thou inquire privily? But if
intending to plot against Him, how is it thou dost not perceive, that
from the fact of their being asked secretly the wise men will be able
to perceive thy craft? But as I have already said, a soul taken captive
by any wickedness becomes more utterly senseless than any thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p40">And he said not, “go and learn concerning the
King,” but “concerning the young Child;” for he could
not even endure to call Him by the name of His dominion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p41">4. But the wise men perceive nothing of this, by reason
of their exceeding reverence (for they never could have expected that
he could have gone on to so great wickedness, and would have attempted
to form plots against a dispensation so marvellous): and they depart
suspecting none of these things, but from what was in themselves
auguring all that would be in the rest of mankind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p42">“And, lo! the star, which they saw in the east,
went before them.”<note n="320" id="iii.VII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. ii. 9" id="iii.VII-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.2.9">Matt. ii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p44">For therefore only was it hidden, that having lost their
guide, they might come to be obliged to make inquiry of the Jews, and
so the matter might be made evident to all. Since after they have made
inquiries, and have had His enemies<note n="321" id="iii.VII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p45">Some <span class="c20" id="iii.VII-p45.1">mss</span>. read “the

the order; how in the first place after the star the people<note n="322" id="iii.VII-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p46">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p46.1">δμο</span>. The
translation is somewhat obscure, throughout the entire
sentence.—R.]</p></note>of the Jews receives them, and the king, and these bring in the
prophecy to explain what had appeared: how next, after the prophet, an
angel again took them up and taught them all things; but for a time
they journey from Jerusalem to Bethlehem by the guidance of the star,
the star again journeying with them from that place also; that hence
too thou mightest learn, that this was not one of the ordinary stars,
for there is not so much as one star that hath this nature. And it not
merely moved, but “went before them,” drawing and guiding
them on in mid-day.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p47">“But what need of this star any more,” one
may ask, “when the place was ascertained?” In order that
the Child also might be seen. For there was not anything to make Him
manifest, since the house was not conspicuous, neither was His mother
glorious, or distinguished. There was need then of the star, to set
them by the place. Wherefore it re-appears on their coming out of
Jerusalem, and stays not, before it hath reached the manger.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p48">And marvel was linked on to marvel; for both were
strange things, as well the magi worshipping, as the star going before
them; and enough to attract even such as were made all of stone. For if
the wise men had said, they had heard prophets say these things, or
that angels had discoursed with them in private, they might have been
disbelieved; but now, when the vision of the star appeared on

<pb n="45" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_45.html" id="iii.VII-Page_45" />

high, even they that were exceeding
shameless had their mouths stopped.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p49">Moreover, the star, when it stood over the young Child,
stayed its course again: which thing itself also was of a greater power
than belongs to a star, now to hide itself, now to appear, and having
appeared to stand still. Hence they too received an increase of faith.
For this cause they rejoiced also, that they had found what they were
seeking, that they had proved messengers of truth, that not without
fruit had they come so great a journey; so great a longing (so to
speak) had they for Christ. For first it came and stood over His very
head, showing that what is born is Divine; next standing there, it
leads them to worship Him; being not simply barbarians, but the wiser
sort amongst them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p50">Seest thou, with how great fitness the star appeared?
Why; because even after the prophecy, and after the interpretation of
the chief priests and scribes, they still had their minds turned
towards it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p51">5. Shame upon Marcion, shame upon Paul of Samosata,<note n="323" id="iii.VII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p52">Because Marcion denied Christ’s human nature,
Paul His Divinity. See Epiph. Hær. 22 and 65.</p></note>for refusing to see what those wise men saw,—the forefathers of
the Church; for I am not ashamed so to call them. Let Marcion be
ashamed, beholding God worshipped in the flesh. Let Paul be ashamed,
beholding Him worshipped as not being merely a man. As to His being in
the flesh, that first is signified by the swaddling clothes and the
manger; as to their not worshipping Him as a mere man, they declare it,
by offering Him, at that unripe age, such gifts as were meet to be
offered to God. And together with them let the Jews also be ashamed,
seeing themselves anticipated by barbarians and magi, whilst they
submit not so much as to come after them. For indeed what happened then
was a type of the things to come, and from the very beginning it was
shown that the Gentiles would anticipate their nation.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p53">“But how was it,” one may ask, “that
not at the beginning, but afterwards, He said, ‘Go ye, and make
disciples of all nations’”? Because the occurrence was a
type, as I said, of the future, and a sort of declaration of it
beforehand. For the natural order was that Jews should come unto Him
first; but forasmuch as they of their own choice gave up their proper
benefit, the order of things was inverted. Since not even in this
instance should the wise men have come before the Jews, nor should
persons from so great a distance have anticipated those who were
settled about the very city, nor should those who had heard nothing
have prevented<note n="324" id="iii.VII-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p54">[That is “preceded;” comp. <scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 15" id="iii.VII-p54.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.15">1 Thess. iv. 15</scripRef> (R.V.) where the same Greek word occurs,

exceedingly ignorant of their own blessings, those from Persia
anticipate those at Jerusalem. And this indeed is what Paul also saith:
“It was necessary that the word of the Lord should first have
been spoken to you, but seeing ye have judged yourselves unworthy, lo,
we turn to the Gentiles.”<note n="325" id="iii.VII-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p55"><scripRef passage="Acts xiii. 46" id="iii.VII-p55.1" parsed="|Acts|13|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.13.46">Acts xiii.

it from the wise men, they ought to have made all haste; but they would
not. Therefore, while those are slumbering, these run before.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p56">6. Let us then also follow the magi, let us separate
ourselves from our barbarian customs, and make our distance therefrom
great, that we may see Christ, since they too, had they not been far
from their own country, would have missed seeing Him. Let us depart
from the things of earth. For so the wise men, while they were in
Persia, saw but the star, but after they had departed from Persia, they
beheld the Sun of Righteousness. Or rather, they would not have seen so
much as the star, unless they had readily risen up from thence. Let us
then also rise up; though all men be troubled, let us run to the house
of the young Child; though kings, though nations, though tyrants
interrupt this our path, let not our desire pass away. For so shall we
thoroughly repel all the dangers that beset us. Since these too, except
they had seen the young Child, would not have escaped their danger from
the king. Before seeing the young Child, fears and dangers and troubles
pressed upon them from every side; but after the adoration, it is calm
and security; and no longer a star but an angel receives them, having
become priests from the act of adoration; for we see that they offered
gifts also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p60">But take heed that thou be not like Herod, and say,
“that I may come and worship Him,” and when thou art come,
be minded to slay Him. For him do they resemble, who partake of the
mysteries unworthily: it being said, that such a one “shall be
guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.”<note n="328" id="iii.VII-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p61"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 27" id="iii.VII-p61.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.27">1 Cor. xi.

Christ’s kingdom, him that is more wicked than Herod of old, even
Mammon. For he would fain have the dominion, and sends them that are
his own to worship in appearance, but slaying while they worship. Let
us fear then, lest at any time, while we have the appearance of
suppliants and worshippers, we should in deed show forth the
contrary.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p62">And let us cast everything out of our hands when we are
to worship; though it be gold that we have, let us offer it unto him
and not bury it. For if those barbarians then offered it for honor,
what will become of thee, not giving even to Him that hath need? If
those men journeyed so far to see Him newly born, what sort of excuse
wilt thou have, not going out of thy way one alley’s length, that
thou mayest visit Him sick or in bonds? And yet when they are sick or
in bonds, even our enemies have our pity; thine is denied even to thy
Benefactor and Lord. And they offered gold, thou hardly givest bread.
They saw the star and were glad, thou, seeing Christ Himself a stranger
and naked, art not moved.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p63">For which of you, for Christ’s sake, hath made so
long a pilgrimage, you that have received countless benefits, as these
barbarians, or rather, these wiser than the wisest philosophers? And
why say I, so long a journey? Nay, many of our women are so delicate,
that they go not over so much as one crossing of the streets to behold
Him on the spiritual manger,<note n="329" id="iii.VII-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p64">Or, “Spiritual Table.” Savile.</p></note>unless they can have mules to draw them. And others being able to walk,
yet prefer to their attendance here, some a crowd of worldly business,
some the theatres. Whereas the barbarians accomplished so great a
journey for His sake, before seeing Him; thou not even after thou hast
seen Him dost emulate them, but forsakest Him after seeing Him, and
runnest to see the stage player. (For I touch again on the same
subjects, as I did also of late.<note n="330" id="iii.VII-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p65">See Hom. vi. 10.</p></note>) And seeing Christ lying in the manger, thou leavest Him, that thou
mayest see women on the stage.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p66">7. What thunderbolts do not these things deserve? For
tell me, if any one were to lead<note n="331" id="iii.VII-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p67">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p67.1">εαγαγεν

“were promising to introduce.”—R.]</p></note>thee into a palace, and show thee the king on his throne, wouldest thou
indeed choose to see the theatre instead of those things? And yet even
in the palace there is nothing to gain; but here a spiritual well of
fire gushes up out of this table. And thou leavest this, and runnest
down to the theatre, to see women swimming, and nature put to open
dishonor, leaving Christ sitting by the well? Yes: for now, as of old,
He sits down by the well, not discoursing to a Samaritan woman, but to
a whole city. Or perchance now too with a Samaritan woman only. For
neither now is any one with Him; but some with their bodies only, and
some not even with these. But nevertheless, He retires not, but
remains, and asks of us to drink, not water, but holiness, for
“His holy things He gives unto the holy.”<note n="332" id="iii.VII-p67.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p68">This expression, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p68.1">Τ

Things for Holy Persons,” is used in the liturgies of St.
Clement, St. James, St. Mark, St. Chrysostom, the Ethiopian liturgy,
and that of Severus.</p></note> For it is not water that He gives us from this fountain, but living
blood; and it is indeed a symbol of death, but it is become the cause
of life.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p69">But thou, leaving the fountain of blood, the awful cup,
goest thy way unto the fountain of the devil, to see a harlot swim, and
to suffer shipwreck of the soul. For that water is a sea of
lasciviousness, not drowning bodies, but working shipwreck of souls.
And whereas she swims with naked body, thou beholding, art sunk into
the deep of lasciviousness. For such is the devil’s net; it
sinks, not them that go down into the water itself, but them that sit
above more than such as wallow therein; and it chokes them more
grievously than Pharaoh, who was of old sunk in the sea with his horses
and his chariots. And if souls could but be seen, I could show you many
floating on these waters, like the bodies of the Egyptians at that
time. But what is still more grievous is this, that they even call such
utter destruction a delight, and they term the sea of perdition a
channel for a pleasure voyage.<note n="333" id="iii.VII-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p70"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VII-p70.1">ἡδον
εριπον</span>.</p></note> Yet surely one might easier pass over in safety the Ægean or the
Tuscan sea, than this spectacle. For in the first place, through a
whole night the devil preoccupies their souls with the expectation of
it; then having shown them the expected object, he binds them at once,
and makes them captives. For think not, because thou hast not been
joined unto the harlot, thou art clean from the sin; for in the purpose
of thine heart thou hast done it all. Since if thou be taken by lust,
thou hast kindled the flame up higher; if thou feel nothing at what

<pb n="47" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_47.html" id="iii.VII-Page_47" />

thou seest, thou deservest a
heavier charge, for being a scandal to others, by encouraging them in
these spectacles, and for polluting thine own eye-sight, and together
with thine eye-sight, thy soul.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p71">However, not merely to find fault, come let us devise a
mode of correction too. What then will the mode be? I would commit you
to your own wives, that they may instruct you. It is true, according to
Paul’s law,<note n="334" id="iii.VII-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p72"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiv. 34, 35" id="iii.VII-p72.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|34|14|35" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.34-1Cor.14.35">1 Cor. xiv.
34, 35</scripRef>.</p></note>you ought to be the teachers. But since that order is reversed by sin,
and the body has come to be above, and the head beneath, let us even
take this way.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p73">But if thou art ashamed to have a woman for thy teacher,
fly from sin, and thou wilt quickly be able to mount up on the throne
which God hath given thee. Since so long as thou sinnest the Scripture
sends thee not to a woman only, but even to things irrational, and
those of the viler sort; yea, it is not ashamed to send thee who art
honored with reason, as a disciple to the ant.<note n="335" id="iii.VII-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p74"><scripRef passage="Prov. vi. 6" id="iii.VII-p74.1" parsed="|Prov|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.6.6">Prov. vi.

so betray their own nobility of race. This then we will do likewise;
and for the present we will commit thee to thy wife; but if thou
despise her, we will send thee away to the school of the very brutes,
and will point out to thee how many birds, fishes, four-footed beasts,
and creeping things are found more honorable, and chaster than
thou.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p75">If now thou art ashamed, and dost blush at the
comparison, mount up to thine own nobility, and fly the sea of hell,
and the flood of fire, I mean the pool in the theatre. For this pool
introduces to that sea, and kindles that abyss of flame. Since if
“he that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath already
committed adultery,”<note n="336" id="iii.VII-p75.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p76"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 28" id="iii.VII-p76.1" parsed="|Matt|5|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.28">Matt. v.

thousandfold a captive? The flood in the days of Noah did not so
utterly destroy the race of men as these swimming women drown all that
are there with great disgrace. For as to that rain, though it wrought
indeed a death of the body, yet did it repress the wickedness of the
soul; but this hath the contrary effect; while the bodies remain, it
destroys the soul. And ye, when there is a question of precedence,
claim to take place of the whole word, forasmuch as our city first
crowned itself with the name of Christian;<note n="337" id="iii.VII-p76.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p77"><scripRef passage="Acts xi. 26" id="iii.VII-p77.1" parsed="|Acts|11|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.26">Acts xi.

thou require us to do? to occupy the mountains, and become
monks?” Why it is this which makes me sigh, that ye think them
alone to be properly concerned with decency and chastity; and yet
assuredly Christ made His laws common to all. Thus, when He saith,
“if any one look on a woman to lust after her,” He speaks
not to the solitary, but to him also that hath a wife; since in fact
that mount was at that time filled with all kinds of persons of that
description. Form then in thy mind an image of that amphitheatre, and
hate thou this, which is the devil’s. Neither do thou condemn the
severity of my speech. For I neither “forbid to
marry,”<note n="338" id="iii.VII-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p79"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. iv. 2" id="iii.VII-p79.1" parsed="|1Tim|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.4.2">1 Tim. iv.

chastity, not with shame, and reproach, and imputations without end. I
do not make it a law that you are to occupy the mountains and the
deserts, but to be good and considerate and chaste, dwelling in the
midst of the city. For in fact all our laws are common to the monks
also, except marriage; yea rather, even with respect to this, Paul
commands us to put ourselves altogether on a level with them; saying,
“For the fashion of this world passeth away:” that
“they that have wives be as though they had none.”<note n="339" id="iii.VII-p79.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p80"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 31, 29" id="iii.VII-p80.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|31|0|0;|1Cor|7|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.31 Bible:1Cor.7.29">1 Cor. vii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.VII-p81">“Wherefore” (so he speaks) “I do not
bid you take possession of the summits of the mountains; it is true I
could wish it, since the cities imitate the things that were done in
Sodom; nevertheless, I do not enforce this. Abide, having house and
children and wife; only do not insult thy wife, nor put thy children to
shame, neither bring into thine house the infection from the
theatre.” Hearest thou not Paul saying, “The husband hath
not power of his own body, but the wife,”<note n="340" id="iii.VII-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VII-p82"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 4" id="iii.VII-p82.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.4">1 Cor. vii.

continually thrusting herself into a public assembly, art severe in
blaming her; but thyself, spending whole days on public shows, thou
dost not account worthy of blame. Yea, touching thy wife’s
modesty thou art so strict as even to go beyond necessity or measure,
and not to allow her so much as indispensable absences; but to thyself
thou deemest all things lawful. Yet Paul allows thee not, who gives the
wife likewise the same authority, for thus he speaks: “Let the

honor then is this,

to harlots (for thy body is hers); when thou bringest tumults and wars
into thine house, when thou doest in the market place such things, as
being related by thyself to thy wife at home, overwhelm her with shame,
and put to shame also thy daughter if present, and more than them,
surely, thyself? For thou must necessarily either be silent, or behave
thyself so unseemly, that it would be just for thy very servants to be
scourged for it. What plea then wilt thou have, I pray thee, beholding,
as thou dost, with great eagerness, things which even to name is
disgraceful; preferring to all sights these, which even to recount is
intolerable?</p>

burdensome, I will here bring my discourse to an end. But if ye
continue in the same courses, I will make the knife sharper, and the
cut deeper; and I will not cease, till I have scattered the theatre of
the devil, and so purified the assembly of the Church. For in this way
we shall both be delivered from the present disgrace, and shall reap
the fruit of the life to come, by the grace and love towards man of our

these things were not done at random, or by chance, but that they all
were in course of accomplishment, according to some Divine

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p7">But what was it that induced them to worship? For
neither was the Virgin conspicuous, nor the house distinguished, nor
was any other of the things which they saw apt to amaze or attract
them. Yet they not only worship, but also “open their
treasures,” and “offer gifts;” and gifts, not as to a
man, but as to God. For the frankincense and the myrrh were a symbol of
this. What then was their inducement? That which wrought upon them to
set out from home and to come so long a journey; and this was both the
star, and the illumination wrought of God in their mind, guiding them
by little and little to the more perfect knowledge. For, surely, had it
not been so, all that was in sight being ordinary, they would not have
shown so great honor. Therefore none of the outward circumstances was
great in that instance, but it was a manger, and a shed, and a mother
in poor estate; to set before thine eyes, naked <i>and bare</i>, those
wise men’s love of wisdom,<note n="344" id="iii.VIII-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p8"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VIII-p8.1">φιλοσοφαν</span>
.</p></note>and to prove to thee, that not as mere man they approached Him, but as
a God, and Benefactor. Wherefore neither were they offended by ought of
what they saw outwardly, but even worshipped, and brought gifts; gifts
not only free from Judaical grossness, in that they sacrificed not
sheep and calves, but also coming nigh to the self-devotion of the
Church, for it was knowledge and obedience and love that they offered
unto Him.</p>

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p11">See from this also their faith, how they were not
offended, but are docile, and considerate; neither are they troubled,
nor reason with themselves, saying, “And yet, if this Child be
great, and hath any might, what need of flight, and of a clandestine
retreat? and wherefore can it be, that when we have come openly and
with boldness, and have stood against so great a people, and against a
king’s madness, the angel sends us out of the city as runaways
and fugitives?” But none of these things did they either say or
think. For this most especially belongs to faith, not to seek an
account of what is enjoined, but merely to obey the commandments laid
upon us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p12">2. “And when they were departed, behold, an angel
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young Child

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p14">There is something here worth inquiring into, both
touching the magi, and touching the Child; for if even they were not
troubled, but received all with faith, it is worthy of examination on
our part, why they and the young Child are not preserved, continuing
there, but they as fugitives go into Persia, He with His mother into
Egypt. But what? should He have fallen into the hands of Herod, and
having fallen, not have been cut off? Nay, He would not have been
thought to have taken flesh upon Him; the greatness of the Economy
would not have been believed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p15">For if, while these things are taking place, and many
circumstances are being ordered mysteriously after the manner of men,
some have dared to say that His assumption of our flesh<note n="347" id="iii.VIII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p16">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VIII-p16.1">τ
σαρκς</span>.]</p></note>is a fable; in what degree of impiety would they not have been wrecked
had He done all in a manner becoming His Godhead, and according to His
own power?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p17">As to the wise men, He sends them off quickly, at once
both commissioning them as teachers to the land of the Persians, and at
the same time intercepting the madness of the king, that he might learn
that he was attempting things impossible, and might quench his wrath,
and desist from this his vain labor. For not alone openly to subdue His
enemies, but also to deceive them with ease, is worthy of His power.
Thus, for example, He deceived the Egyptians also in the case of the
Jews, and having power to transfer their wealth openly into the hands
of the Hebrews, He bids them do this secretly and with craft; and this
surely, not less than the other miracles, made Him an object of terror
to His enemies. At least, they of Ascalon, and all the rest, when they
had taken the ark, and being smitten, did after that devise their
countrymen not to fight, nor to set themselves against Him, with the
other miracles brought this also forward, saying, “Wherefore
harden ye your hearts, as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened? when He had
mocked them, did He not after that send forth His people, and they
departed?”<note n="348" id="iii.VIII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p18"><scripRef passage="1 Sam. vi. 6" id="iii.VIII-p18.1" parsed="|1Sam|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.6.6">1 Sam. vi.

those other signs that had been done openly, towards the demonstration
of His power, and of His greatness. And the like ensued on this
occasion too; a thing sufficient to astonish the tyrant. For consider
what it was natural for Herod to feel, and how his very breath would be
stopped, deceived as he was by the wise men, and thus laughed to scorn.
For what, if he did not become better? It is not His fault, who
marvellously ordered all this, but it is the excess of Herod’s
madness, not yielding even to those things which had virtue<note n="349" id="iii.VIII-p18.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p19">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VIII-p19.1">το
δυναμνοι</span>.]</p></note>to have persuaded him, and deterred him from his wickedness, but going
on still further, to receive a yet sharper punishment for folly so
great.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p20">3. But wherefore, it may be said, is the young Child
sent into Egypt? In the first place, the evangelist himself hath
mentioned the cause, saying, “That it might be fulfilled, Out of
Egypt have I called my Son.” And at the same time beginnings of
fair hopes were thenceforth proclaimed before to the world. That is,
since Babylon and Egypt, most in the whole earth, were burnt up with
the flame of ungodliness, He, signifying from the first that He means
to correct and amend both, and inducing men hereby to expect His
bounties in regard of the whole world likewise, sent to the one the
wise men, the other He Himself visited with His mother.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p21">And besides what I have said, there is another lesson
also, which we are hereby taught, tending not slightly to true
self-command in us. Of what kind then is it? To look from the beginning
for temptations and plots. See, for instance, how this was the case
even at once from His swaddling clothes. Thus you see at His birth,
first a tyrant raging, then flight ensuing, and departure beyond the
border; and for no crime His mother is exiled into the land of the
barbarians: that

spiritual matter, and then to see thyself suffering incurable ills, and
enduring countless dangers), shouldest not be greatly troubled, nor
say, “What can this be? yet surely I ought to be crowned and
celebrated, and be glorious and illustrious for fulfilling the
Lord’s commandment:” but that having this example, thou
mightest bear all things nobly, knowing that this especially is the
order of all things spiritual, to have everywhere temptations in the
same lot with them. See at least how this is the case not only with
regard to the mother of the young Child, but also of those barbarians;
since they for their part retire secretly in the condition of
fugitives; and she again, who had never passed over the threshold of
her house, is commanded to undergo so long a journey of affliction, on
account of this wonderful birth, and her spiritual travail.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p22">And behold a wonder again. Palestine plots, and Egypt
receives and preserves Him that is the object of the plots. For, as it
appears, not only in the instance of the sons of the patriarch<note n="350" id="iii.VIII-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p23"><i>i.e</i>., of Jacob.</p></note>did types take place, but also in our Lord’s own case. In many
instances, we are sure, His doings at that time were prophetic
declarations of what was to happen afterwards; as, for example, in the
matter of the ass and the colt.<note n="351" id="iii.VIII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p24">The received mystical interpretation of our
Lord’s final entry into Jerusalem represented the ass as the type
of the Jewish converts, and the colt, of the Gentile Church. See
hereafter, Hom. LXVI., and comp. Origen on St. Matt. t. 16, 15; St.
Amb. in Luc. lib. 9, 4–14; St. Just. Mart. Dial. cum. Tryph. c.
53. The interpretation to which St. Chrysostom points of the flight
into Egypt, is probably the same with that of St. Hilary on this place.
“Joseph is admonished by the angel to take the young child into
Egypt: Egypt full of idols, and given to the worship of all kinds of
portents for gods. Accordingly, after the persecution by the Jews, and
the assent of that profane multitude to His murder, Christ passes over
to the nations, sold as they were to the vainest superstitions. He
leaves Jewry, and is carried into the world which knows Him not: while
Bethlehem, <i>i.e</i>., Judæa, overflows with the blood of
martyrs. As to Herod’s rage and his murdering the infants, it is
the type of the Jewish people raging against the Christians, under the
notion that by the slaughter of the blessed martyrs they may blot out
Christ’s name from the faith and profession of all men.”
p.613, ed. Ben. Paris, 1693.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p25">4. Now the angel having thus appeared, talks not with
Mary, but with Joseph; and what saith he? “Arise, and take the
young Child and His mother.” Here, he saith not any more,
“thy wife,” but “His mother.” For after that
the birth had taken place, and the suspicion was done away, and the
husband appeased, thenceforth the angel talks openly, calling neither
child nor wife his, but “take the young Child and His mother, and
flee into Egypt;” and he mentions the cause of the flight:
“For Herod,” saith he, “will seek the young
Child’s life.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p26">Joseph, when he had heard these things, was not
offended, nether did he say, “The thing is hard to understand:
Didst thou not say just now, that He should save His people?’ and
now He saves not even Himself: but we must fly, and go far from home,
and be a long time away: the facts are contrary to the promise.”
Nay, none of these things doth he say (for the man was faithful):
neither is he curious about the time of his return; and this though the
angel had put it indefinitely thus: “Be thou there until I tell
thee.” But nevertheless, not even at this did he shudder, but
submits and obeys, undergoing all the trials with joy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p27">And this because God, who is full of love to man, did
with these hardships mingle things pleasant also; which indeed is His
way with regard to all the saints, making neither their dangers nor
their refreshment continual, but weaving the life of all righteous men,
out of both the one and the other. This very thing He did here also:
for consider, Joseph saw the Virgin with child; this cast him into
agitation and the utmost trouble, for he was suspecting the damsel of
adultery. But straightway the angel was at hand to do away his
suspicion, and remove his fears; and seeing the young child born, he
reaped the greatest joy. Again, this joy no trifling danger succeeds,
the city being troubled, and the king in his madness seeking after Him
that was born. But this trouble was again succeeded by another joy; the
star, and the adoration of the wise men. Again, after this pleasure,
fear and danger; “For Herod,” saith he, “is seeking
the young Child’s life,” and He must needs fly and withdraw
Himself as any mortal might: the working of miracles not being
seasonable as yet. For if from His earliest infancy He had shown forth
wonders, He would not have been accounted a Man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p28">Because of this, let me add, neither is a temple framed
at once; but a regular conception takes place, and a time of nine
months, and pangs, and a delivery, and giving suck, and silence for so
long a space, and He awaits the age proper to manhood; that by all
means acceptance might be won for the mystery of His Economy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p29">“But wherefore then,” one may say,
“were even these signs wrought at the beginning?” For His
mother’s sake; for the sake of Joseph and of Simeon, who was
presently to depart; for the sake of the shepherds and of the wise men;
for the sake of the Jews. Since they, had they been willing to mind
diligently what was taking place, would from this event also have
reaped no small advantage in regard of what was to come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p30">But if the prophets do not mention what

<pb n="51" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_51.html" id="iii.VIII-Page_51" />

relates to the wise men, be not troubled; for
they neither foretold all things, nor were they silent touching all.
For as without any warning to see those things coming to pass, would
naturally occasion much astonishment and trouble; so also to have been
informed of all would dispose the hearer to sleep, and would have left
nothing for the evangelists to add.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p31">5. And if the Jews should raise a question touching the
prophecy, and say, that the words, “Out of Egypt have I called my
Son,” were uttered concerning themselves; we would tell them,
This is a law of prophecy, that in many cases much that is spoken of
one set of persons is fulfilled in another; of which kind is that which
is said touching Simeon and Levi, “I will divide them,”
saith He, “in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.”<note n="352" id="iii.VIII-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p32"><scripRef passage="Gen. xlix. 7" id="iii.VIII-p32.1" parsed="|Gen|49|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.49.7">Gen. xlix.

trembling, and worshipping his brother over and over again?<note n="355" id="iii.VIII-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p35"><scripRef passage="Gen. xxxiii. 3" id="iii.VIII-p35.1" parsed="|Gen|33|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.33.3">Gen.

case also. For which may be called the truer son of God, he that
worships a calf, and is joined to Baalpeor<note n="356" id="iii.VIII-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p36">[The reference is to <scripRef passage="Numb. xxv. 3" id="iii.VIII-p36.1" parsed="|Num|25|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.25.3">Numb. xxv. 3</scripRef>.

honors Him that begat Him? So that, except this man had come, the
prophecy would not have received, its due fulfillment. It is worth
observing, too, that the evangelist intimates the same by the phrase,
“that it might be fulfilled;” implying that it would not
have been fulfilled, unless He had come.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p37">And this makes the Virgin also in no common degree
glorious and distinguished; that the very thing which was the whole
people’s special endowment in the way of praise, she also might
thenceforth have for her own. I mean, that whereas they were proud of
their coming up from Egypt, and used to boast of it (which indeed the
prophet also was hinting at, when he said, “Have I not brought up
the strangers from Cappadocia, and the Assyrians from the
pit”<note n="357" id="iii.VIII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p38"><scripRef passage="Amos ix. 7" id="iii.VIII-p38.1" parsed="|Amos|9|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.9.7">Amos ix.

Philistines.” Comp. <scripRef passage="1 Sam.; 2 Sam." id="iii.VIII-p38.4">1 and 2 Samuel</scripRef>, <i>passim</i> (in LXX.).—R.]</p></note>), He makes this pre-eminence belong to the Virgin likewise.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p39">Rather, however, both the people and the patriarch,
going down thither, and coming up thence, were together completing the
type of this <i>His</i> return. Thus, as they went down to avoid death
by famine, so He death by conspiracy. But whereas they on their arrival
were for the time delivered from the famine, this man, when He had gone
down, sanctified the whole land, by setting His foot thereon.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p40">At least it is observable how, in the midst of His
humiliations, the tokens of His Godhead are disclosed. Thus, first of
all, the angel saying, “Flee into Egypt,” did not promise
to journey with them, either in their descent or return; intimating
that they have a great fellow-traveller, the Child that had been born;
such an one as actually changed all things immediately on His
appearing, and wrought so that His enemies should minister in many ways
to this Economy. Thus magi and barbarians, leaving the superstition of
their fathers, are come to worship: thus Augustus ministers to the
birth at Bethlehem by the decree for the taxing; Egypt receives and
preserves Him, driven from His home, and plotted against, and obtains a
sort of first impulse towards her union unto Him; so that when in
after-time she should hear Him preached by the apostles, she might have
this at least to glory of, as having received Him first. And yet this
privilege did belong unto Palestine alone; but the second proved more
fervent than the first.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p41">6. And now, shouldest thou come unto the desert of
Egypt, thou wilt see this desert become better than any paradise, and
ten thousand choirs of angels in human forms, and nations of martyrs,
and companies of virgins, and all the devil’s tyranny put down,
while Christ’s kingdom shines forth in its brightness. And the
mother of poets, and wise men, and magicians,<note n="358" id="iii.VIII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p42">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.VIII-p42.1">σοφν

worthy of heaven, is this, which was declared unto them by the
fishermen. And for this very cause, together with their so great
exactness in doctrine, they exhibit also by their life that extreme
seriousness. For when they have stripped themselves of all that they
have, and are crucified to the whole world, they urge their course on
again yet farther, using the labor of their body for the nourishment of
them that be in need. For neither, because they fast and watch, do they
think it meet to be idle by day; but their nights they spend in the
holy hymns and in vigils, and their days in prayers, and at the same
time in laboring with their own hands imitating the zeal of the
apostle.<note n="359" id="iii.VIII-p42.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p43"><scripRef passage="Acts xx. 34; 1 Thess. ii. 9" id="iii.VIII-p43.1" parsed="|Acts|20|34|0|0;|1Thess|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.34 Bible:1Thess.2.9">Acts xx.

nourishing them that were in need, both occupied a workshop, and
practised a craft, and being thus employed did not so much as sleep by
night; how much more, say they, is it meet that we, who have taken up
our abode in the wilderness, and have nothing to do with the turmoils
in the cities, should use the leisure of our quiet for spiritual
labors!</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p44">Let us then be ashamed all of us, both they that are
rich, and they that are poor, when those having nothing at all but a
body only and hands, force their way on and strive eagerly to find
thence a supply for the poor; while we, having endless stores within,
touch not even our superfluities for these objects. What kind of plea
shall we have then, I pray thee? and what sort of excuse?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p45">Yet further consider, how of old these Egyptians were
both avaricious, and gluttonous, together with their other vices. For

Nevertheless, having a willing mind, they changed: and having caught
fire from Christ, they set off at once on their voyage towards heaven;
and though more ardent than the rest of mankind, and more headstrong,
both in anger, and in bodily pleasures, they imitate the incorporeal
powers in meekness, and in the rest of that freedom from passions which
pertains unto self-denial.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p47">7. Now if any man hath been in the country, he knows
what I say. But if he have never entered those tabernacles, let him
call to mind him who even until now is in the mouths of all
men,—him whom, after the apostles, Egypt brought forth,—the
blessed and great Antony; and let him put it to himself, “This
man, too, was born in the same country with Pharaoh; nevertheless he
was not thereby damaged, but both had a divine vision vouchsafed him,
and showed forth such a life as the laws of Christ require.” And
this any man shall know perfectly, when he hath read the book that
contains the history of that man’s life;<note n="361" id="iii.VIII-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p48">In the works of St. Athanasius.</p></note>in which also he will perceive much prophecy. I allude to his
prediction about those infected with the errors of Arius, and his
statement of the mischief that would arise from them; God even then
having shown them to him, and sketched out before his eyes all that was
coming. A thing which most especially (among the rest) serves to
demonstrate the truth, that no person, belonging to the heresies
without, hath such a man to mention. But, not to depend on us for this
information, look earnestly into what is written in that book, and ye
will learn all exactly, and thence be instructed in much
self-denial.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p49">And this advice I give, that we not merely peruse what
is written there, but that we also emulate it, and make neither place,
nor education, nor forefathers’ wickedness an excuse.

<pb n="52" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_52.html" id="iii.VIII-Page_52" />

For if we will take heed to ourselves,
none of these things shall be an hindrance to us, since even Abraham
had an ungodly father,<note n="362" id="iii.VIII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.VIII-p50"><scripRef passage="Josh. xxiv. 2" id="iii.VIII-p50.1" parsed="|Josh|24|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Josh.24.2">Josh. xxiv.
2</scripRef>.</p></note>but he inherited not his wickedness; and Hezekiah, Ahaz: yet
nevertheless he became dear to God. And Joseph too when in the midst of
Egypt, adorned himself with the crowns of temperance; and the Three
Children no less in the midst of Babylon, and of the palace, when a
table like those at Sybaris was set before them, showed the highest
self-denial; and Moses also in Egypt, and Paul in the whole world; but
nothing was to any one of these an hindrance in the race of virtue.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.VIII-p51">Let us then, bearing in mind all these things, put out
of the way these our superfluous pleas and excuses, and apply ourselves
to those toils which the cause of virtue requires. For thus shall we
both attract to ourselves more favor from God, and persuade Him to
assist us in our struggles, and we shall obtain the eternal blessings;
unto which God grant that we may all attain, by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and victory for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.IX-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.IX-p4.1">Yet</span> surely it was a case not
for anger, but for fear and awe: he ought to have perceived that he was
attempting impossible things. But he is not refrained. For when a soul
is insensible and incurable, it yields to none of the medicines given
by God. See for example this man following up his former efforts,<note n="363" id="iii.IX-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p5"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p5.1">το

For driven wild by this anger, and envy, as by some demon, he takes
account of nothing, but rages even against nature herself, and his
anger against the wise men who had mocked him he vents upon the
children that had done no wrong: venturing then in Palestine upon a
deed akin to the things that had been done in Egypt. For he “sent
forth,” it is said, “and slew all the children that were in
Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under,
according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise
men.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p6">Here attend to me carefully. Because many things are
uttered by many very idly touching these children, and the course of
events is charged with injustice, and some of these express their
perplexity about it in a more moderate way, others with more of
audaciousness and frenzy. In order then that we may free these of their
madness and those of their perplexity, suffer us to discourse a little
upon this topic. Plainly, then, if this be their charge, that the
children were left to be slain, they should find fault likewise with
the slaughter of the soldiers that kept Peter.<note n="364" id="iii.IX-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p7"><scripRef passage="Acts xii. 19" id="iii.IX-p7.1" parsed="|Acts|12|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.12.19">Acts xii.

massacred in the place of Him who was sought; even so then, too, Peter
having been delivered from his prison and chains by the angel, one of
like name with this tyrant, and like temper too, when he had sought
him, and found him not, slew instead of him the soldiers that kept
him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p8">“But what is this?” it may be said;
“why this is not a solution, but an enhancement of our
difficulty.” I know it too, and for this intent I bring forward
all such cases, that to all I may adduce one and the same solution.
What then is the solution of these things? or what fair account of them
can we give? That Christ was not the cause of their slaughter, but the
king’s cruelty; as indeed neither was Peter to those others, but
the madness of Herod. For if he had seen the wall broken through, or
the doors overthrown, he might, perhaps, have had ground to accuse the
soldiers that kept the apostle, of neglect; but now when all things
continued in due form,<note n="365" id="iii.IX-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p9"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p9.1">ἐπ

and the chains fastened to the hands of them that kept him
(for in fact they were bound unto him), he might have inferred from
these things (that is, if he had been strictly doing a judge’s
office on the matters before him), that the event was not of human
power or craft, but of some divine and wonder-working power; he might
have adored the doer of these things, instead of waging war with the
sentinels. For God had so done all that He did, that so far from
exposing the keepers, He was by their means leading the king unto the
truth. But if he proved senseless, what signifies to<note n="366" id="iii.IX-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p10">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p10.1">τ πρς</span>,

insubordination of him that is diseased?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p11">And just this one may say in the present case likewise.
For, wherefore art thou wroth, O Herod, at being mocked of the wise
men? didst thou not know that the birth was divine? didst thou not
summon the chief priests? didst thou not gather together the scribes?
did not they, being called, bring the prophet also with them into thy
court of judgment, proclaiming these things beforehand from of old?
Didst thou not see how the old things agreed with the new? Didst thou
not hear that a star also ministered to these men? Didst thou not
reverence the zeal of the barbarians? Didst thou not marvel at their
boldness? Wast thou not horror-struck at the truth of the prophet?
Didst thou not from the former things perceive the very last also?
Wherefore didst thou not reason with thyself from all these things,
that this event was not of the craft of the wise men, but of a Divine
Power, duly dispensing all things? And even if thou wert deceived by
the wise men, what is that to<note n="367" id="iii.IX-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p12">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p12.1">τ
πρς</span>.]</p></note>the young children, who have done no wrong?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p13">2. “Yea,” saith one, “Herod thou hast
full well deprived of excuse, and proved him blood-thirsty; but thou
hast not yet solved the question about the injustice of what took
place. For if he did unjustly, wherefore did God permit it?” Now,
what should we say to this? That which I do not cease to say
continually, in church, in the market-place and everywhere; that which
I also wish you carefully to keep in mind, for it is a sort of rule for
us, suited to every such perplexity. What then is our rule, and what
our saying? That although there be many that injure, yet is there not
so much as one that is injured. And in order that the riddle may not
disturb you too much, I add the solution too with all speed. I mean,
that what we may suffer unjustly from any one, it tells either to the
doing away of our sins, God so putting that wrong to our account; or
unto the recompense of rewards.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p14">And that what I may say may be clearer, let us conduct
our argument in the way of illustration. As thus: suppose a certain
servant who owes much money to his master, and then that this servant
has been despitefully used by unjust men, and robbed of some of his
goods. If then the master, in whose power it was to stay the plunderer
and wrong doer, should not indeed restore that same property, but
should reckon what was taken away towards what was owed him by his
servant, is the servant then injured? By no means. But what if he
should repay him even more? Has he not then even gained more than he
has lost? Every one, I suppose, perceives it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p15">Now this same reckoning we are to make in regard of our
own sufferings. For as to the fact, that in consideration of what we
may suffer wrongfully, we either have sins done away, or receive more
glorious crowns, if the amount of our sins be not so great: hear what
Paul says concerning him that had committed fornication, “Deliver
ye such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
spirit may be saved.”<note n="368" id="iii.IX-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 5" id="iii.IX-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.5">1 Cor. v.

sufferer. But, to bring my argument nearer the very point inquired of;
remember David, how, when he saw Shimei at a certain time assailing
him, and trampling on his affliction, and pouring on him revilings
without end, his captains desiring to slay him, he utterly forbade
them, saying, “Let him curse, that the Lord may look upon mine
abasement, and that he may requite me good for this cursing this

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p20">3. “But what kind of sin had these
children,” it may be said, “that they should do it away?
for touching those who are of full age, and have been guilty of many
negligences, one might with show of reason speak thus: but they who so
underwent premature death, what sort of sins did they by their
sufferings put away?” Didst thou not hear me say, that though
there were no sins, there is a recompense of rewards hereafter for them
that suffer ill here? Wherein then were the young children hurt in
being slain for such a cause, and borne away speedily into that
waveless harbor? “Because,” sayest thou, “they would
in many instances have achieved, had they lived, many and great deeds
of goodness.” Why, for this cause He lays up for them beforehand
no small reward, the ending their lives for such a cause. Besides, if
the children were to have been any great persons, He would not have
suffered them to be snatched away beforehand. For if they that
eventually will live in continual wickedness are endured by Him with so
great long-sufferings, much more would He not have suffered these to be
so taken off had He foreknown they would accomplish any great
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p21">And these are the reasons we have to give; yet these are
not all; but there are also others more mysterious than these, which He
knoweth perfectly, who Himself ordereth these things. Let us then give
up unto Him the more perfect understanding of this matter, and apply
ourselves to what follows, and in the calamities of others let us learn
to bear all things nobly. Yea, for it was no little scene of woe, which
then befell Bethlehem, the children were snatched from their
mother’s breast, and dragged unto this unjust slaughter.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p22">And if thou art yet faint-hearted, and not equal to
controlling thyself in these things, learn the end of him who dared all
this, and recover thyself a little. For very quickly was he overtaken
by punishment for these things; and he paid the due penalty of such an
abominable act, ending his life by a grievous death, and more pitiable
than that which he now dared inflict;<note n="372" id="iii.IX-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p23">See Josephus, A.J. xvii. 6, 5.</p></note>suffering also countless additional ills, which ye may know of by
perusing Josephus’ account of these events. But, lest we should
make our discourse long, and interrupt its continuity, we have not
thought it necessary to insert that account in what we are saying.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p27">Thus having filled the hearer with horror by relating
these things: the slaughter so violent and unjust, so extremely cruel
and lawless; he comforts him again, by saying, Not from God’s
wanting power to prevent it did all this take place, nor from any
ignorance of His, but when He both knew it, and foretold it,<note n="375" id="iii.IX-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p28">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p28.1">προανακηρττοντο</span>,

looking unto His unspeakable providence, which one may most clearly
see, alike by what He works, and by what He permits. And this He
intimated in another place also, when discoursing to His disciples. I
mean where, having forewarned them of the judgment seats, and
executions, and of the wars of the world, and of the battle that knows
no truce, to uphold their spirit and to comfort them He saith,
“Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your Father which is in Heaven.”<note n="376" id="iii.IX-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p29"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 29" id="iii.IX-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|10|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.29">Matt. x.

knowledge, but while He knows all, yet not in all doth He act.
“Be not then troubled,” He saith, “neither be
disturbed.” For if He know what ye suffer, and hath power to
hinder it, it is quite clear that it is in His providence and care for
you that He doth not hinder it. And this we ought to bear in mind in
our own temptations also, and great will be the consolation we shall
thence receive.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p30">But what, it may be said, hath Rachel to do with
Bethlehem? For it saith, “Rachel weeping for her children.”
And what hath Rama to do with Rachel? Rachel was the mother of

was near this place.<note n="377" id="iii.IX-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p31"><scripRef passage="Gen. 35.19; 48.7" id="iii.IX-p31.1" parsed="|Gen|35|19|0|0;|Gen|48|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.35.19 Bible:Gen.48.7">Gen. xxxv. 19, LXX. and xlviii. 7</scripRef>.</p></note> The tomb then being near, and the portion pertaining unto Benjamin her

saith, “she would not be comforted because they are
not.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p33">Hence again we are taught this, which I mentioned
before, never to be confounded when what is happening is contrary to
the promise of God. Behold, for instance, when

<pb n="55" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_55.html" id="iii.IX-Page_55" />

He was come for the salvation of the people, or
rather for the salvation of the world, of what kind were His
beginnings. His mother, first, in flight; His birth-place is involved
in irremediable calamities, and a murder is perpetrated of all murders
the bitterest, and there is lamentation and great mourning, and
wailings everywhere. But be not troubled; for He is wont ever to
accomplish His own dispensations by their contraries, affording us from
thence a very great demonstration of His power.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p34">Thus did He lead on His own disciples also, and prepared
them to do all their duty, bringing about things by their contraries,
that the marvel might be greater. They, at any rate, being scourged and
persecuted, and suffering terrors without end, did in this way get the
better of them that were beating and persecuting them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p37">He no more saith “fly,” but
“go.” Seest thou again after the temptation refreshment?

from his banishment, and came back again to his own country; and beheld
the murderer of the children brought to the slaughter;<note n="380" id="iii.IX-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p38"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p38.1">σφαγιασθντα</span>.

of the former perils, the son of the tyrant living, and being king.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p39">But how did Archelaus reign over Judæa, when
Pontius Pilate was governor? Herod’s death had recently taken
place, and the kingdom had not yet been divided into many parts; but as
he had only just ended his life, the son for a while kept possession of
the kingdom “in the room of his father Herod;” his brother
also bearing this name, which is the reason why the evangelist added,
“in the room of <i>his father</i> Herod.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p40">It may be said, however, “if he was afraid to
settle in Judæa on account of Archelaus, he had cause to fear
Galilee also on account of Herod.” I answer, By his changing the
place, the whole matter was thenceforward thrown into shade; for the
whole assault was upon “Bethlehem and the coasts thereof.”
Therefore now that the slaughter had taken place, the youth Archelaus
had no other thought, but that the whole was come to an end, and that
amongst the many, He that was sought had been destroyed. And besides,
his father having come to such an end of his life before his eyes, he
became for the future more cautious about farther proceedings, and
about urging on that course of iniquity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p41">Joseph therefore comes to Nazareth, partly to avoid the
danger, partly also delighting to abide in his native place. To give
him the more courage, he receives also an oracle from the angel
touching this matter. Luke, however, doth not say that he came there by
Divine warning, but that when they had fulfilled all the purification,
they returned to Nazareth.<note n="381" id="iii.IX-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p42"><scripRef passage="Luke ii. 39" id="iii.IX-p42.1" parsed="|Luke|2|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.2.39">Luke ii.
39</scripRef>.</p></note> What then may one say? That Luke is giving an account of the time
before the going down to Egypt, when he saith these things. For He
would not have brought them down thither before the purification, in
order that nothing should be done contrary to the law, but he waited
for her to be purified, and to go to Nazareth, and that then they
should go down to Egypt. Then, after their return, He bids them go to
Nazareth. But before this they were not warned of God to go thither,
but yearning after their native place, they did so of their own accord.
For since they had gone up for no other cause but on account of the
taxing, and had not so much as a place where to stay, when they had
fulfilled that for which they had come up, they went down to Nazareth.<note n="382" id="iii.IX-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p43">[Of this there is no hint in the narrative; it is a

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p44">6. We see here the cause why the angel also, putting
them at ease for the future, restores them to their home. And not even
this simply, but he adds to it a prophecy, “That it might be

shall be called a Nazarene.”<note n="383" id="iii.IX-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. ii. 23" id="iii.IX-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|2|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.2.23">Matt. ii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p46">And what manner of prophet said this? Be not curious,

over the others, and thoroughly excite them to the same emulation. For
when he is speaking of those noble and great men, hear how he saith,
“They that say these things, show plainly that they seek a

enrolled him as their father, the rule of the people passed away to
another, to him who had become his son in the way of virtue. And what
harm was it to Timothy, that he was of a Greek father? Or what on the
other hand again was Noah’s son profited by the virtue of his
father, when he became a slave instead of free? Seest thou, how little

nature, and cast him not only out of the nobility which he had in
respect of his father, but also out of his free estate. And what of
Esau? Was he not son of Isaac, and had he not his father to stand his
friend? Yea, his father too endeavored and desired that he should
partake of the blessings, and he himself for the sake of this did all
that was commanded him. Nevertheless, because he was untoward,<note n="399" id="iii.IX-p64.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p65"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p65.1">σκαο</span>.</p></note>none of these things profited him; but although he was by birth first,

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p70">8. Let us not therefore pride ourselves either on high
birth, or on wealth, but rather despise them who are so minded: neither
let us be dejected at poverty. But let us seek that wealth, which
consists in good works; let us flee that poverty, which causes men to
be in wickedness, by reason of which also that rich man was poor;<note n="403" id="iii.IX-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p71"><scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 24" id="iii.IX-p71.1" parsed="|Luke|16|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.24">Luke xvi.

that, although he made much entreaty. Whereas, who can be so poor
amongst us,<note n="404" id="iii.IX-p71.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p72">The words in italics are omitted in several <span class="c20" id="iii.IX-p72.1">mss</span>. [In four <span class="c20" id="iii.IX-p72.2">mss</span> and two

Homily.—R.]</p></note><i>as to want water enough even for comfort</i>? There is none such.
For even they that are pining with extreme hunger, may have the comfort
of a drop of water; and not of a drop only, but of refreshment too far
more abundant. Not so that rich man, but he was poor even to this
degree: and what was yet more grievous, he could not so much as soothe
his poverty from any source. Why then do we gape after riches, since
they bring us not into Heaven?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p73">For tell me, if any king among those upon earth had
said, It is impossible for him that is rich to be distinguished at
court, or to enjoy any honor; would ye not have thrown away every one
his riches with contempt? So then, if they cast us out from such honor
as is in the palaces below, they shall be worthy of all contempt: but,
when the King of Heaven is day by day crying aloud and saying,
“It is hard with them, to set foot on that sacred
threshold;” shall we not give up all, and withdraw from our
possessions, that with boldness we may enter into the kingdom? And of
what consideration are we worthy, who are at great pains to encompass
ourselves with the things that obstruct our way thither; and to hide
them not only in chests, but even in the earth, when we might entrust
them to the guard of the very Heavens? Since now surely thou art doing
the same, as if any husbandman, having gotten wheat wherewith to sow a
rich land, was to leave the land alone, and bury all the wheat in a
pit, so as neither to enjoy it himself, nor for the wheat to come to
ought, but decay and waste. But what is their common plea, when we
accuse them of these things? It gives no little comfort, say they, to
know that all is laid up for us in safety at home. Nay, rather not to
know of its being laid up is a comfort. For even if thou art not afraid
of famine, yet other more grievous things, on account of this store,
must needs be a terror to thee: deaths, wars, plots laid against thee.
And if a famine should ever befall us, the people again, constrained by
the belly, takes weapon in hand against thy house. Or rather, in so
doing, thou art first of all bringing famine into our cities, and next
thou art forming for thine own house this gulf, more grievous than
famine. For by stress of famine I know not any who have come to a
speedy end; there being in fact many means in many quarters which may
be devised to assuage that evil: but for possessions and riches, and
the pursuits connected with them, I can show many to have come by their
ruin, some in secret, some openly. And with many such instances the
highways abound, with many the courts of law, and the market-places.
But why speak I of the highways, the courts of law and the
market-places? Why, the very sea thou mayest behold filled with their
blood. For not over the land only, as it seems, hath this tyranny
prevailed, but over the ocean also hath walked in festal procession
with great excess. And one makes a voyage for gold, another, again, is
stabbed for the same; and the same tyrannical power hath made one a
merchant, the other a murderer.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p74">What then can be less trustworthy than Mammon, seeing
that for his sake one travels, and ventures, and is slain? “But
who,” it is said, “will pity a charmer that is bitten with
a serpent?”<note n="405" id="iii.IX-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p75"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 12.13" id="iii.IX-p75.1" parsed="|Sir|12|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.12.13">Ecclus. xii. 13</scripRef>.</p></note> For we ought, knowing its cruel tyranny, to flee that slavery, and
destroy that grievous longing. “But how,” saith one,
“is this possible?” By introducing another longing, the
longing for Heaven. Since he that desires the kingdom will laugh
covetousness to scorn; he that is become Christ’s slave is no
slave of mammon, but rather his lord; for him that flieth from him, he
is wont to follow, and to fly from him that pursues. He honors not so
much his pursuer as his despiser; no one doth he so laugh to scorn, as
them that desire him; nor

<pb n="58" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_58.html" id="iii.IX-Page_58" />

doth he
only laugh them to scorn, but wraps round them also innumerable
bonds.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p76">Be it ours then, however late, to loose these grievous
chains. Why bring thy reasonable soul into bondage to brute matter, to
the mother of those untold evils? But, oh the absurdity! that while we
are warring against it in words, it makes war with us by deeds, and
leads and carries us everywhere about, insulting us as purchased with
money, and meet for the lash; and what can be more disgraceful and
dishonorable than this?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p77">Again: if we do not get the better of senseless forms of
matter, how shall we have the advantage of the incorporeal powers? If
we despise not vile earth and abject stones, how shall we bring into
subjection the principalities and authorities? How shall we practise
temperance? I mean, if silver dazzle and overpower us, when shall we be
able to hurry by a fair face? For, in fact, some are so sold under this
tyranny, as be moved somehow even at the mere show of the gold, and in
playfulness to say, that the very eyes are the better for a gold coin
coming in sight. But make not such jests, whoever thou art;<note n="406" id="iii.IX-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p78">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.IX-p78.1">ἄνθρωπε</span>.]</p></note>for nothing so injures the eyes, both those of the body and those of
the soul, as the lust of these things. For instance; it was this
grievous longing that put out the lamps of those virgins, and cast them
out of the bride chamber. This sight, which (as thou saidst)
“doeth good to the eyes,” suffered not the wretched Judas
to hearken unto the Lord’s voice, but led him even to the halter,
made him burst asunder in the midst; and, after all that, conducted him
on to hell.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p79">What then can be more lawless than this? what more
horrible? I do not mean the substance of riches, but the unseasonable
and frantic desire of them? Why, it even drops human gore, and looks
murder, and is fiercer than any wild beast, tearing in pieces them that
fall in its way, and what is much worse, it suffers them not even to
have any sense of being so mangled. For reason would that those who are
so treated should stretch forth their hand to them that pass by, and
call them to their assistance, but these are even thankful for such
rendings of their flesh, than which what can be more wretched?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.IX-p80">Let us then, bearing in mind all these things, flee the
incurable disease; let us heal the wounds it hath made, and withdraw
ourselves from such a pest: in order that both here we may live a
secure and untroubled life, and attain to the future treasure; <i>unto
which God grant that we may all attain</i>,<note n="407" id="iii.IX-p80.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.IX-p81">Om. in one or two <span class="c41" id="iii.IX-p81.1">mss</span>. [The

<p class="c48" id="iii.X-p3">“In those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching
in the wilderness of Judæa, and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom
of Heaven is at hand.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.X-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.X-p4.1">How</span> “in those
days”? For not then, surely, when He was a child, and came to
Nazareth, but thirty years after, John cometh; as Luke also testifies.
How then is it said, “in those days”? The Scripture is
always wont to use this manner of speech, not only when it is
mentioning what occurs in the time immediately after, but also of
things which are to come to pass many years later. Thus also, for
example, when His disciples came unto Him as He sat on the Mount of
Olives, and sought to learn about His coming, and the taking of
Jerusalem:<note n="408" id="iii.X-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p5"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 3" id="iii.X-p5.1" parsed="|Matt|24|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.3">Matt. xxiv.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>and yet ye know how great is the interval between those several
periods. I mean, that having spoken of the subversion of the mother
city,

<pb n="59" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_59.html" id="iii.X-Page_59" />

and completed His discourse
on that subject, and being about to pass to that on the consummation,
he inserted, “<i>Then</i> shall these things also come to
pass;”<note n="409" id="iii.X-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p6"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 23" id="iii.X-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|24|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.23">Matt. xxiv.
23</scripRef>.</p></note>not bringing together the times by the word <i>then</i>, but indicating
that time only in which these things were to happen. And this sort of
thing he doth now also, saying, “In those days.” For this
is not put to signify the days that come immediately after, but those
in which these things were to take place, which he was preparing to
relate.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p7">“But why was it after thirty years,” it may
be said, “that Jesus came unto His baptism”? After this
baptism He was thenceforth to do away with the law: wherefore even
until this age, which admits of all sins, He continues fulfilling it
all; that no one might say, that because He Himself could not fulfill
it, He did it away. For neither do all passions assail us at all times;
but while in the first age of life there is much thoughtlessness and
timidity, in that which comes after it, pleasure is more vehement, and
after this again the desire of wealth. For this cause he awaits the
fullness of His adult age, and throughout it all fulfills the law, and
so comes to His baptism, adding it as something which follows upon the
complete keeping of all the other commandments.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p8">To prove that this was to Him the last good work of
those enjoined by the law, hear His own words: “For thus it
becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.”<note n="410" id="iii.X-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p9"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 15" id="iii.X-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.15">Matt. iii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> Now what He saith is like this: “We have performed all the duties
of the law, we have not transgressed so much as one commandment. Since
therefore this only remains, this too must be added, and so shall we
“fulfill all righteousness.” For He here calls by the name
of “righteousness” the full performance of all the
commandments.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p10">2. Now that on this account Christ came to His baptism,
is from this evident. But wherefore was this baptism devised for Him?
For that not of himself did the son of Zacharias proceed to this, but
of God who moved him,—this Luke also declares, when he saith,
“The word of the Lord came unto him,”<note n="411" id="iii.X-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p11"><scripRef passage="Luke iii. 2" id="iii.X-p11.1" parsed="|Luke|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.3.2">Luke iii.
2</scripRef>.</p></note>that is, His commandment. And he himself too saith, “He that sent
me to baptize with water, the same said to me, upon whom thou shalt see
the Spirit descending like a dove, and remaining on Him, the same is He
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.”<note n="412" id="iii.X-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p12"><scripRef passage="John i. 33" id="iii.X-p12.1" parsed="|John|1|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.33">John i.
33</scripRef>.</p></note> Wherefore then was he sent to baptize? The Baptist again makes this
also plain to us, saying, “I knew Him not, but that He should be
made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with
water.”<note n="413" id="iii.X-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p13"><scripRef passage="John i. 31" id="iii.X-p13.1" parsed="|John|1|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.31">John i.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p14">And if this was the only cause, how saith Luke, that
“he came into the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins?”<note n="414" id="iii.X-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p15"><scripRef passage="Luke iii. 3" id="iii.X-p15.1" parsed="|Luke|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.3.3">Luke iii.

that was given afterwards; for in this “we are buried with
Him,”<note n="415" id="iii.X-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p16"><scripRef passage="Col. ii. 12; Rom. vi. 4" id="iii.X-p16.1" parsed="|Col|2|12|0|0;|Rom|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.12 Bible:Rom.6.4">Col. ii.
12; Rom. vi. 4</scripRef>.</p></note>and our old man was then crucified with Him, and before the cross there
doth not appear remission anywhere; for everywhere this is imputed to
His blood. And Paul too saith, “But ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified,” not by the baptism of John, but “in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.”<note n="416" id="iii.X-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p17"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 11" id="iii.X-p17.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.11">1 Cor. vi.

repentance,” (he saith not “of remission,”)
“that they should believe on Him that should come after
him.”<note n="417" id="iii.X-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p18"><scripRef passage="Acts xix. 4" id="iii.X-p18.1" parsed="|Acts|19|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.4">Acts xix.

come down, nor sin was put away, nor the enmity removed, nor the curse
destroyed; how was remission to take place?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p19">What means then, “for the remission of
sins?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p20">The Jews were senseless, and had never any feeling of
their own sins, but while they were justly accountable for the worst
evils, they were justifying themselves in every respect; and this more
than anything caused their destruction, and led them away from the
faith. This, for example, Paul himself was laying to their charge, when
he said, that “they being ignorant of God’s righteousness,
and going about<note n="418" id="iii.X-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p21">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p21.1">ζητοντε</span>,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p26">Since therefore this was the cause of their evils, John
cometh, doing nothing else but bringing them to a sense of their own
sins. This, among other things, his very garb declared, being that of
repentance and confession. This was indicated also by what he preached,
for nothing else did he say, but

<pb n="60" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_60.html" id="iii.X-Page_60" />

“bring forth fruits meet for
repentance.”<note n="423" id="iii.X-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 8" id="iii.X-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.8">Matt. iii.
8</scripRef>.</p></note> Forasmuch then as their not condemning their own sins, as Paul also
hath explained, made them start off from Christ, while their coming to
a sense thereof would set them upon longing to seek after their
Redeemer, and to desire remission; this John came to bring about, and
to persuade them to repent, not in order that they might be punished,
but that having become by repentance more humble, and condemning
themselves, they might hasten to receive remission.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p28">But let us see how exactly he hath expressed it; how,
having said, that he “came preaching the baptism of repentance in
the wilderness of Judæa,” he adds, “for
remission,” as though he said, For this end he exhorted them to
confess and repent of their sins; not that they should be punished, but
that they might more easily receive the subsequent remission. For had
they not condemned themselves, they could not have sought after His
grace; and not seeking, they could not have obtained remission.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p29">Thus that baptism led the way for this; wherefore also
he said, that “they should believe on Him which should come after
him;”<note n="424" id="iii.X-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p30"><scripRef passage="Acts xix. 4" id="iii.X-p30.1" parsed="|Acts|19|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.19.4">Acts xix.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>together with that which hath been mentioned setting forth this other
cause of His baptism. For neither would it have been as much for him to
have gone about to their houses, and to have led Christ around, taking
Him by the hand, and to have said, “Believe in This Man;”
as for that blessed voice to be uttered, and all those other things
performed in the presence and sight of all.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p31">On account of this He cometh to the baptism. Since in
fact both the credit of him that was baptizing, and the purport of the
thing itself,<note n="425" id="iii.X-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p32"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p32.1">ἡ το πργματο
πθεσι</span>.</p></note>was attracting the whole city, and calling it unto Jordan; and it
became a great spectacle.<note n="426" id="iii.X-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p33"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p33.1">θατρον</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p34">Therefore he humbles them also when they are come, and
persuades them to have no high fancies about themselves; showing them
liable to the utmost evils, unless they would repent, and leaving their
forefathers, and all vaunting in them, would receive Him that was
coming.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p35">Because in fact the things concerning Christ had been up
to that time veiled, and many thought He was dead, owing to the
massacre which took place at Bethlehem. For though at twelve years old
He discovered Himself, yet did He also quickly veil Himself again. And
for this cause there was need of that splendid exordium and of a
loftier beginning. Wherefore also then for the first time he with clear
voice proclaims things which the Jews had never heard, neither from
prophets, nor from any besides; making mention of Heaven, and of the
kingdom there, and no longer saying anything touching the earth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p36">But by the kingdom in this place he means His former and
His last advent.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p37">3. “But what is this to the Jews?” one may
say, “for they know not even what thou sayest.” “Why,
for this cause,” saith he, “do I so speak, in order that
being roused by the obscurity of my words, they may proceed to seek
Him, whom I preach.” In point of fact, he so excited them with
good hopes when they came near, that even many publicans and soldiers
inquired what they should do, and how they should direct their own
life; which was a sign of being thenceforth set free from all worldly
things, and of looking to other greater objects, and of foreboding<note n="427" id="iii.X-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p38"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p38.1">ὀνειροπολεν</span>
.</p></note>things to come. Yea, for all, both the sights and the words of that
time, led them unto lofty thoughts.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p39">Conceive, for example, how great a thing it was to see a
man after thirty years coming down from the wilderness, being the son
of a chief priest, who had never known the common wants of men, and was
on every account venerable, and had Isaiah with him. For he too was
present proclaiming him, and saying, “This is he who I said
should come crying, and preaching throughout the whole wilderness with
a clear voice.” For so great was the earnestness of the prophets
touching these things, that not their own Lord only, but him also who
was to minister unto Him, they proclaimed a long time beforehand, and
they not only mentioned him, but the place too in which he was to
abide, and the manner of the doctrine which he had to teach when he
came, and the good effect that was produced by him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p40">See, at least, how both the prophet and the Baptist go
upon the same ideas, although not upon the same words.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p41">Thus the prophet saith that he shall come saying,
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths
straight.”<note n="428" id="iii.X-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p42"><scripRef passage="Is. xl. 3" id="iii.X-p42.1" parsed="|Isa|40|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.3">Is. xl.

for repentance,”<note n="429" id="iii.X-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 8" id="iii.X-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.8">Matt. iii.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>which corresponds with, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord.”
Seest thou that both by the words of the prophet, and by his own
preaching, this one thing is manifested alone; that he was come, making
a way and preparing beforehand, not bestowing the gift, which was the
remission, but ordering in good time the souls of such as should
receive the God of all?</p>

<pb n="61" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_61.html" id="iii.X-Page_61" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p44">But Luke expresses somewhat further: not repeating the
exordium, and so passing on, but setting down likewise all the
prophecy. “For every valley,” saith he, “shall be
filled; and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the
crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth; and all
flesh shall see the salvation of God.”<note n="430" id="iii.X-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p45"><scripRef passage="Luke iii. 5, 6" id="iii.X-p45.1" parsed="|Luke|3|5|3|6" osisRef="Bible:Luke.3.5-Luke.3.6">Luke iii.
5, 6</scripRef>.</p></note> Dost thou perceive how the prophet hath anticipated all by his words;
the concourse of the people, the change of things for the better, the
easiness of that which was preached, the first cause of all that was
occurring, even if he hath expressed it rather as in figure, it being
in truth a prophecy which he was uttering? Thus, when he saith,
“Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall
be brought low, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;” he is
signifying the exaltation of the lowly, the humiliation of the
self-willed, the hardness of the law changed into easiness of faith.
For it is no longer toils and labors, saith he, but grace, and
forgiveness of sins, affording great facility of salvation. Next he
states the cause of these things, saying, “All flesh shall see
the salvation of God;” no longer Jews and proselytes only, but
also all earth and sea, and the whole race of men. Because by
“the crooked things” he signified our whole corrupt life,
publicans, harlots, robbers, magicians, as many as having been
perverted before afterwards walked in the right way: much as He Himself
likewise said, “publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God
before you,”<note n="431" id="iii.X-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 31" id="iii.X-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|21|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.31">Matt. xxi.
31</scripRef>.</p></note>because they believed. And in other words also again the prophet
declared the self-same thing, thus saying, “Then wolves and lambs
shall feed together.”<note n="432" id="iii.X-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p47"><scripRef passage="Isa. xi. 6" id="iii.X-p47.1" parsed="|Isa|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.11.6">Isa. xi.

of character<note n="433" id="iii.X-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p48"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p48.1">τ
νμαλον το
θου</span>.</p></note>are blended into one and the same evenness of self-restraint, so also
there, by the characters of the brute animals indicating the different
dispositions of men, he again spoke of their being linked in one and
the same harmony of godliness. Here also, as before, stating the cause.
That cause is, “There shall be He that riseth to reign over the
Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles trust:”<note n="434" id="iii.X-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p49"><scripRef passage="Isa. 11.10; Rom. 15.12" id="iii.X-p49.1" parsed="|Isa|11|10|0|0;|Rom|15|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.11.10 Bible:Rom.15.12">Isa. xi. 10; see also Rom. xv. 12</scripRef>. [“Hope” instead of
“trust;” see foot-note on Hom. vii. 2, p. 45.—R.]</p></note>much the same as here too he said, “All flesh shall see the
salvation of God,” everywhere declaring that the power and
knowledge of these our Gospels would be poured out to the ends of the
world, converting the human race, from a brutish disposition and a
fierce temper to something very gentle and mild.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p50">4. “And the same John had his raiment of
camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins.”<note n="435" id="iii.X-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 4" id="iii.X-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|3|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.4">Matt. iii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p52">Observe, how the prophets foretold some things, others
they left to the evangelists. Wherefore also Matthew both sets down the
prophecies, and adds his own part, not accounting even this
superfluous, to speak of the dress of the righteous man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p53">For indeed it was a marvellous and strange thing to
behold so great austerity in a human frame: which thing also
particularly attracted the Jews, seeing in him the great Elijah, and
guided by what they then beheld, to the memory of that blessed man; or
rather, even to a greater astonishment. For the one indeed was brought
up in cities and in houses, the other dwelt entirely in the wilderness
from his very swaddling clothes. For it became the forerunner of Him
who was to put away all the ancient ills, the labor, for example, the
curse, the sorrow, the sweat; himself also to have certain tokens of
such a gift, and to come at once to be above that condemnation. Thus he
neither ploughed land, nor opened furrow, he ate not his bread by the
sweat of his face, but his table was hastily supplied, and his clothing
more easily furnished than his table, and his lodging yet less
troublesome than his clothing. For he needed neither roof, nor bed, nor
table, nor any other of these things, but a kind of angel’s life
in this our flesh did he exhibit. For this cause his very garment was
of hair, that by his dress he might instruct men to separate themselves
from all things human, and to have nothing in common with the earth,
but to hasten back to their earlier nobleness, wherein Adam was before
he wanted garments or robe. Thus that garb bore tokens of <i>nothing
less than</i> a kingdom, and of repentance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p54">And do not say to me, “Whence had he a garment of
hair and a girdle, dwelling as he did in the wilderness?” For if
thou art to make a difficulty of this, thou wilt also inquire into more
things besides; how in the winters, and how in the heats of summer, he
continued in the wilderness, and this with a delicate body, and at an
immature age? how the nature of his infant flesh endured such great
inconstancy of weather, and a diet so uncommon, and all the other
hardships arising from the wilderness?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p55">Where now are the philosophers of the Greeks, who at
random and for nought emu

lated the
shamelessness of the Cynics (for what is the profit of being shut up in
a tub, and afterwards running into such wantonness)? they who
encompassed themselves with rings and cups, and men servants and maid
servants, and with much pomp besides, falling into either extreme. But
this man was not so; but he dwelt in the wilderness as in Heaven,
showing forth all strictness of self-restraint. And from thence, like
some angel from Heaven, he went down unto the cities, being a champion
of godliness, and a crowned victor over the world, and a philosopher of
that philosophy which is worthy of the heavens. And these things were,
when sin was not yet put away, when the law had not yet ceased, when
death was not yet bound, when the brazen gates were not yet broken up,
but while the ancient polity still was in force.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p56">Such is the nature of a noble and thoroughly vigilant
soul, for it is everywhere springing forward, and passing beyond the
limits set to it; as Paul<note n="436" id="iii.X-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p57">As in refusing to be supported (in several cases) by
those to whom he preached the gospel. See his account of his views in

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p58">But why, it may be asked, did he use a girdle with his
raiment? This was customary with them of old time, before men passed
into this soft and loose kind of dress. Thus, for instance, both

work continually, laboring, and busying themselves either in
journeyings, or about some other necessary matter; and not for this
cause only, but also with a view of trampling under foot all ornaments,
and practising all austerity. This very kind of thing accordingly
Christ declares to be the greatest praise of virtue, thus saying,
“What went ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft raiment?
behold, they that wear soft clothing are in king’s
houses.”<note n="440" id="iii.X-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p62"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 8" id="iii.X-p62.1" parsed="|Matt|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.8">Matt. xi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p63">But if he, who was so pure, and more glorious than the
heaven, and above all prophets, than whom none greater was born, and
who had such great boldness of speech, thus exercised himself in
austerity, scorning so exceedingly all dissolute delicacy, and training
himself to this hard life; what excuse shall we have, who after so
great a benefit, and the unnumbered burdens of our sins, do not show
forth so much as the least part of his penance,<note n="441" id="iii.X-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p64"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p64.1">ἐξομολογσεω</span>

and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him,
confessing their sins.”<note n="443" id="iii.X-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p67"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 5, 6" id="iii.X-p67.1" parsed="|Matt|3|5|3|6" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.5-Matt.3.6">Matt. iii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p68">Seest thou how great power was in the coming of the
prophet? how he stirred up all the people; how he led them to a
consideration of their own sins? For it was indeed worthy of wonder to
behold him in human form showing forth such things and using so great
freedom of speech, and rising up in condemnation of all as children,
and having his great grace beaming out from his countenance. And,
moreover, the appearance of a prophet after the great interval of time
contributed to their amazement, because the gift had failed them, and
returned to them after a long time. And the nature of his preaching too
was strange and unusual. For they heard of none of those things to
which they were accustomed; such as wars and battles and victories
below, and famine and pestilence, and Babylonians and Persians, and the
taking of the city, and the other things with which they were familiar,
but of Heaven and of the kingdom there, and of the punishment in hell.
And it was for this cause, let me add, that although they that
committed revolt in the wilderness, those in the company of Judas, and
of Theudas,<note n="444" id="iii.X-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p69"><scripRef passage="Acts v. 36, 37" id="iii.X-p69.1" parsed="|Acts|5|36|5|37" osisRef="Bible:Acts.5.36-Acts.5.37">Acts v. 36,
37</scripRef>.</p></note>had been all of them slain no great while before, yet they were not the
more backward to go out thither. For neither was it for the same
objects that he summoned them, as for dominion, or revolt, or
revolution; but in order to lead them by the hand to the kingdom on
high. Wherefore neither did he keep them in the wilderness to take them
about with him, but baptizing them, and teaching them the rules
concerning self-denial, he dismissed them; by all means instructing
them to scorn whatever things are on earth, and to raise themselves up
to the things to come, and press on every day.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p70">6. This man then let us also emulate, and forsaking
luxury and drunkenness let us go over unto the life of restraint. For
this surely is the time of confession both for the uninitiated and for
the baptized; for the one, that upon their repentance they may partake
of the sacred mysteries; for the others, that having washed away their
stain after baptism, they may approach the table with a clean

<pb n="63" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_63.html" id="iii.X-Page_63" />

conscience. Let us then forsake this
soft and effeminate way of living. For it is not, it is not possible at
once both to do penance<note n="445" id="iii.X-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p71"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p71.1">ἐξομολογεσθαι</span>
.</p></note>and to live in luxury. And this let John teach you by his raiment, by
his food, by his abode. What then? dost thou require us, you may say,
to practise such self-restraint as this? I do not require it, but I
advise and recommend it. But if this be not possible to you, let us at
least, though in cities, show forth repentance, for the judgment is
surely at our doors. But even if it were further off, we ought not even
so to be emboldened, for the term of each man’s life is the end
of the world virtually to him that is summoned. But that it is even at
the doors, hear Paul saying, “The night is far spent, the day is
at hand;”<note n="446" id="iii.X-p71.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p72"><scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 12" id="iii.X-p72.1" parsed="|Rom|13|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.12">Rom. xiii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p74">For the signs too are now complete, which announce that
day. For “this Gospel of the Kingdoms,” saith He,
“shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
nations; and then shall the end come.”<note n="448" id="iii.X-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p75"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 14" id="iii.X-p75.1" parsed="|Matt|24|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.14">Matt. xxiv.

nations,” so R.V., and comp. what follows here.—R.]</p></note> Attend with care to what is said. He said not, “when it hath been
believed by all men,” but “when it hath been preached to<note n="449" id="iii.X-p75.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p76">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p76.1">παρ

πασ</span>, is the explanation of Chrysostom,
paraphrasing the New Testament passage.—R.]</p></note>all.” For this cause he also said, “for a witness to the
nations,” to show, that He doth not wait for all men to believe,
and then for Him to come. Since the phrase, “for a
witness,” hath this meaning, “for accusation,”
“for reproof,” “for condemnation of them that have
not believed.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p77">But we, while hearing these things and seeing them,
slumber, and see dreams, sunk in a lethargy, as in some very deepest
night.<note n="450" id="iii.X-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p78">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p78.1">ἐν βαθυττ

prosperous, or whether they be painful. Wherefore I entreat you now at
length to be awakened, and to look another way, unto the Sun of
Righteousness. For no man while sleeping can see the sun, nor delight
his eyes with the beauty of its beams; but whatever he may see, he
beholds all as in a dream. For this cause we need much penance, and
many tears; both as being in a state of insensibility while we err, and
because our sins are great, and beyond excuse. And that I lie not, the
more part of them that hear me are witnesses. Nevertheless, although
they be beyond excuse, let us repent, and we shall receive crowns.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.X-p79">7. But by repentance I mean, not only to forsake our
former evil deeds, but also to show forth good deeds greater than
those. For, “bring forth,” saith he, “fruits meet for
repentance.”<note n="451" id="iii.X-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p80"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 8" id="iii.X-p80.1" parsed="|Matt|3|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.8">Matt. iii.

Chrysostom.—R.]</p></note> But how shall we bring them forth? If we do the opposite things: as for
instance, hast thou seized by violence the goods of others? henceforth
give away even thine own. Hast thou been guilty of fornication for a
long time? abstain even from thy wife for certain appointed days;
exercise continence. Hast thou insulted and stricken such as were
passing by? Henceforth bless them that insult thee, and do good to them
that smite thee. For it sufficeth not for our health to have plucked
out the dart only, but we must also apply remedies to the wound. Hast
thou lived in self-indulgence, and been drunken in time past? Fast, and
take care to drink water, in order to destroy the mischief that hath so
grown up within thee. Hast thou beheld with unchaste eyes beauty that
belonged to another? Henceforth do not so much as look upon a woman at
all, that thou mayest stand in more safety. For it is said,
“Depart from evil, and do good;”<note n="452" id="iii.X-p80.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p81"><scripRef passage="Ps. xxxiv. 14" id="iii.X-p81.1" parsed="|Ps|34|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.34.14">Ps. xxxiv.

he hath well said, “pursue” her: for she is driven away,
and cast out; she hath left the earth, and is gone to sojourn in
Heaven. Yet shall we be able to bring her back again, if we will put
away pride and boasting, and whatsoever things stand in her way, and
will follow this temperate and frugal life.<note n="454" id="iii.X-p82.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.X-p83">[“If we desire (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.X-p83.1">θλωμεν</span>), by putting away,

men both puffed up and servile, by the former making them ridiculous,
by the other hateful; and bringing in opposite vices, pride and
flattery, at the same time. But if we will cut off the greediness of
this passion, we shall be both lowly with exactness, and exalted with
safety. For in our bodies too all distempers arise from excess; and
when the elements thereof leave their proper limits, and go on beyond
moderation, then all these countless diseases are generated, and
grievous kinds of death. Somewhat of the same kind one may see take
place with respect to the soul likewise.</p>

salutary medicine of moderation,

heed to our prayers. Though we receive not, let us persevere that we
may receive; and if we do receive, then because we have received. For

preached. For so they thought they regarded their prophets and their

shall say, From heaven, He will say unto us, How then did ye not
believe him?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p8">So that from all these things it is manifest that they
came indeed and were baptized, yet they did not abide in the belief of
that which was preached. For John also points out their wickedness, by
their sending<note n="459" id="iii.XI-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p9">[“When some of them were
sending.”—R.]</p></note>unto the Baptist, and saying, “Art thou Elias? Art thou

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p11">“What then? were not the multitudes also of this
same mind”? one may say. Nay, the multitudes in simplicity of
mind had this suspicion, but the Pharisees, wishing to lay hold of Him.
For since it was acknowledged that Christ comes out of the village of
David, and this man was of the tribe of Levi, they laid a snare by the
question, in order that if he should say any such thing they might
quickly come upon him. This at any rate he hath declared by what
follows; for on his not acknowledging any of the things which they
expected, even so they take hold of him, saying, “Why baptizest
thou then, if thou be not the Christ?”<note n="461" id="iii.XI-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p12"><scripRef passage="John i. 25" id="iii.XI-p12.1" parsed="|John|1|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.25">John i.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p13">And to convince thee that the Pharisees came with one
mind, and the people with another, hear how the evangelist hath
declared this too; saying of the people, “that they came and were
baptized of him, confessing their sins;”<note n="462" id="iii.XI-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 6" id="iii.XI-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.6">Matt. iii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>but concerning the Pharisees, no longer like that, but that “when
he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming, he said, O
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to
come?” O greatness of mind! How doth he discourse unto men ever
thirsting after the blood of the prophets, and in disposition no better
than serpents! how doth he disparage both themselves and their
progenitors with all plainness!</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p15">2. “Yea,” saith one; “he speaks
plainly enough, but the question is if there be any reason in this
plainness. For he did not see them sinning, but in the act of change;
wherefore they did not deserve blame, but rather praise and
approbation, for having left city and houses, and making haste to hear
his preaching.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p16">What then shall we say? That he had not things present,
and even now doing, in his view, but he knew the secrets of their mind,
God having revealed this. Since then they were priding themselves on
their forefathers, and this was like to prove the cause of their
destruction, and was casting them into a state of carelessness, he cuts
away the roots of their pride. For this cause Isaiah also calls them,
“rulers of Sodom,” and “people of
Gomorrah;”<note n="463" id="iii.XI-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p17"><scripRef passage="Is. i. 10" id="iii.XI-p17.1" parsed="|Isa|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.10">Is. i.
10</scripRef>.</p></note>and another prophet saith, “Are ye not as children of the
Ethiopians;”<note n="464" id="iii.XI-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p18"><scripRef passage="Amos ix. 7" id="iii.XI-p18.1" parsed="|Amos|9|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.9.7">Amos ix.
7</scripRef>.</p></note>and all withdraw them from this way of thinking, bringing down their
pride, which had caused them unnumbered evils.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p19">“But the prophets,” you will say,
“naturally did so; for they saw them sinning: but in this case,
with what view and for what cause doeth he the same, seeing them obey
him.” To make them yet more tender-hearted.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p20">But if one accurately mark his words, he hath also
tempered his rebuke with commendation. For he spake these things, as
marveling at them, that they were become able, however late, to do what
seemed almost an impossibility for them. His rebuke, you see, is rather
that of one bringing them over, and working upon them to arouse
themselves. For in that he appears amazed, he implies both their former
wickedness to be great, and their conversion marvellous and beyond
expectation. Thus, “what hath come to pass,” saith he,
“that being children of those men, and brought up so badly, they
have repented? Whence hath come so great a change? Who hath softened
down the harshness of their spirit? Who corrected that which was
incurable?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p21">And see how straightway from the beginning he alarmed
them, by laying first, for a foundation, his words concerning hell. For
he spake not of the usual topics: “Who hath warned you to flee
from wars, from the inroads of the barbarians, from captivities, from
famines, from pestilences?” but concerning another sort of
punishment, never before made manifest to them, he was striking the
first preparatory note, saying thus, “Who hath warned you to flee
from the wrath to come?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p22">And full well did he likewise call them,
“generation of vipers.” For that animal too is said to
destroy the mother that is in travail with her, and eating through her
belly, thus to come forth unto light; which kind of thing these men
also did being “murderers of fathers, and murderers of
mothers,”<note n="465" id="iii.XI-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p23"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. i. 9" id="iii.XI-p23.1" parsed="|1Tim|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.1.9">1 Tim. i.

<pb n="66" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_66.html" id="iii.XI-Page_66" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p24">3. However, he stops not at the rebuke, but introduces
advice also. For, “Bring forth,” says he, “fruits
meet for repentance.”<note n="466" id="iii.XI-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p25">[R.V., “worth of repentance,” marg.,
“your repentance.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p26">For to flee from wickedness is not enough, but you must
show forth also great virtue. For let me not have that contradictory
yet ordinary<note n="467" id="iii.XI-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p27">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p27.1">συνθη</span> ]</p></note>case, that<note n="468" id="iii.XI-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p28">The correct reading seems to be <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p28.1">ὅτε</span>,
“when,” not <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p28.2">ὅτι</span>, “that.”—R]</p></note>refraining yourselves for a little while, ye return unto the same
wickedness. For we are not come for the same objects as the prophets
before. Nay, the things that are now are changed, and are more exalted,
forasmuch as the Judge henceforth is coming, His very self, the very
Lord of the kingdom, leading unto greater self-restraint, calling us to
heaven, and drawing us upward to those abodes. For this cause do I
unfold the doctrine also touching hell, because both the good things
and the painful are for ever. Do not therefore abide as ye are, neither
bring forward the accustomed pleas, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the noble
race of your ancestors.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p29">And these things he said, not as forbidding them to say
that they were sprung from those holy men, but as forbidding them to
put confidence in this, while they were neglecting the virtue of the
soul; at once bringing forward publicly what was in their minds, and
foretelling things to come. Because after this they are found to say,
“We have Abraham to our father, and were never in bondage to any
man.”<note n="469" id="iii.XI-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p30"><scripRef passage="John viii. 33" id="iii.XI-p30.1" parsed="|John|8|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.33">John viii.
33</scripRef>.</p></note> Since then it was this, which most of all lifted them up with pride and
ruined them, he first puts it down.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p31">And see how with his honor paid to the patriarch he
combines his correction touching these things. Namely, having said,
“Think not to say, We have Abraham to our father,” he said
not, “for the patriarch shall not be able to profit you
anything,” but somehow in a more gentle and acceptable manner he
intimated the self-same thing, by saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p32">“For God is able of these stones to raise up
children to Abraham.”<note n="470" id="iii.XI-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 9" id="iii.XI-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.9">Matt. iii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p34">Now some say, that concerning the Gentiles he saith
these things, calling them <i>stones</i>, metaphorically; but I say,
that the expression hath also another meaning. But of what kind is
this? Think not, saith he, that if you should perish, you would make
the patriarch childless. This is not, this is not so. For with God it
is possible, both out of stones to give him men, and to bring them to
that relationship; since at the beginning also it was so done. For it
was like the birth of men out of stones, when a child came forth from
that hardened womb.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p35">This accordingly the prophet also was intimating, when
he said, “Look unto the hard rock, whence ye are hewn, and to the
hole of the pit, whence ye are digged: look unto Abraham your father,
and unto Sarah that bare you.”<note n="471" id="iii.XI-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p36"><scripRef passage="Is. li. 1, 2" id="iii.XI-p36.1" parsed="|Isa|51|1|51|2" osisRef="Bible:Isa.51.1-Isa.51.2">Is. li. 1,
2</scripRef>.</p></note> Now of this prophecy, you see, he reminds them, showing that if at the
beginning he made him a father, as marvellously as if he had made him
so out of stones, it was possible for this now also to come to pass.
And see how he both alarms them, and cuts them off: in that he said
not, “He had already raised up,” lest they should despair
of themselves, but that He “is able to raise up:” and he
said not, “He is able out of stones to make men,” but what
was a much greater thing, “kinsmen and children of
Abraham.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p37">Seest thou how for the time he drew them off from their
vain imagination about things of the body, and from their refuge in
their forefathers; in order that they might rest the hope of their
salvation in their own repentance and continence? Seest thou how by
casting out their carnal relationship, he is bringing in that which is
of faith?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p38">4. Mark then how by what follows also he increases their
alarm, and adds intensity to their agonizing fear.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p39">For having said that “God is able of these stones
to raise up children unto Abraham,” he added, “And now also
the axe is laid unto the root of the trees,”<note n="472" id="iii.XI-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 10" id="iii.XI-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.10">Matt. iii.
10</scripRef>. [R.V., “And even
now is the axe laid,” etc.—R.]</p></note>by all means making his speech alarming. For as he from his way of life
had much freedom of speech, so they needed his severe rebuke, having
been left barren<note n="473" id="iii.XI-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p41"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p41.1">χερσωθντε</span>.</p></note>now for a long time. For “why do I say” (such are his
words) “that ye are on the point of falling away from your
relationship to the patriarch and of seeing others, even those that are
of stones, brought in to your pre-eminence? Nay, not to this point only
will your penalty reach, but your punishment will proceed further.
“For now,” saith he, “the axe is laid unto the root
of the trees.” There is nothing more terrible than this turn of
his discourse. For it is no longer “a flying sickle,”<note n="474" id="iii.XI-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p42"><scripRef passage="Zech. v. 1" id="iii.XI-p42.1" parsed="|Zech|5|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Zech.5.1">Zech. v.
1</scripRef>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XI-p42.2">LXX</span>.</p></note>nor “the taking down of a hedge,” nor “the treading

5</scripRef>.</p></note>but an axe exceeding sharp, and what is worse, it is even at the doors.
For inasmuch as they continually disbelieved the prophets, and used to
say, “Where is the day of the Lord:”<note n="476" id="iii.XI-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p44">See <scripRef passage="Amos v. 18; Jer. xvii. 15; Ezek. xii. 22, 27" id="iii.XI-p44.1" parsed="|Amos|5|18|0|0;|Jer|17|15|0|0;|Ezek|12|22|0|0;|Ezek|12|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.5.18 Bible:Jer.17.15 Bible:Ezek.12.22 Bible:Ezek.12.27">Amos v.

the counsel of the
Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it,”<note n="477" id="iii.XI-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p45"><scripRef passage="Is. v. 19" id="iii.XI-p45.1" parsed="|Isa|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.5.19">Is. v.
19</scripRef>.</p></note>by reason that it was many years before what they said came to pass; to
lead them off from this encouragement also, he sets the terrors close
to them. And this he declared by saying “now,” and by his
putting it to “the root.” “For the space between is
nothing now,” saith he, “but it is laid to the very
root.” And he said not, “to the branches,” nor
“to the fruits,” but “to the root.” Signifying,
that if they were negligent, they would have incurable horrors to
endure, and not have so much as a hope of remedy. It being no servant
who is now come, as those before Him were, but the very Lord of all,
bringing on them His fierce and most effectual vengeance.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p46">Yet, although he hath terrified them again, he suffers
them not to fall into despair; but as before he said not “He hath
raised up,” but “He is able to raise up children to
Abraham” (at once both alarming and comforting them); even so
here also he did not say that “it hath touched the root,”
but “it is laid to the root, and is now hard by it, and shows
signs of no delay.” However, even though He hath brought it so
near, He makes its cutting depend upon you. For if ye change and become
better men, this axe will depart without doing anything; but if ye
continue in the same ways, He will tear up the tree by the roots. And
therefore, observe, it is neither removed from the root, nor applied as
it is doth it cut at all: the one, that ye may not grow supine, the
other to let you know that it is possible even in a short time to be
changed and saved. Wherefore he doth also from all topics heighten
their fear, thoroughly awakening and pressing them on to repentance.
Thus first their falling away from their forefathers; next, others
being introduced instead; lastly, those terrors being at their doors,
the certainty of suffering incurable evils (both which he declared by
the root and the axe), was sufficient to rouse thoroughly those even
that were very supine, and to make them full of anxiety. I may add,
that Paul too was setting forth the same, when he said, “A short
word<note n="478" id="iii.XI-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p47"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p47.1">λγον</span>.</p></note>will the Lord make upon the whole world.”<note n="479" id="iii.XI-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p48"><scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 28" id="iii.XI-p48.1" parsed="|Rom|9|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.28">Rom. ix.
28</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p49">But be not afraid; or rather, be afraid, but despair
not. For thou hast yet a hope of change; the sentence is not quite
absolute,<note n="480" id="iii.XI-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p50.1">ατοτελς</span>,
<i>self-executed</i>.</p></note>neither did the axe come to cut (else what hindered it from cutting,
close as it was to the root?); but on purpose by this fear to make thee
a better man, and to prepare thee to bring forth fruit. For this cause
he added, “Therefore every tree, which bringeth not forth good
fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire.”<note n="481" id="iii.XI-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 10" id="iii.XI-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.10">Matt. iii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> Now by the word “every,” he rejects again the privilege
which they had from their noble descent; “Why, if thou be
Abraham’s own descendant,” saith he, “if thou have
thousands of patriarchs to enumerate, thou wilt but undergo a double
punishment, abiding unfruitful.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p52">By these words he alarmed even publicans, the
soldiers’ mind was startled by him, not casting them into
despair, yet ridding them of all security. For along with the terror,
there is also much encouragement in what he saith; since by the
expression, “which bringeth not forth good fruit,” he
signified that what bears fruit is delivered from all vengeance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p53">5. “And how,” saith one, “shall we be
able to bring forth fruit, when the edge is being applied, and the time
so strait, and the appointed season cut short.” “Thou wilt
be able,” saith he, “for this fruit is not of the same kind
as that of common trees, waiting a long time, and in bondage to the
necessities<note n="482" id="iii.XI-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p54"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p54.1">ἀναγκα</span>.</p></note>of seasons, and requiring much other management; but it is enough to be
willing, and the tree at once hath put forth its fruit. For not the
nature of the root only, but also the skill of the husbandman
contributes the most to that kind of fruit-bearing.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p55">For (let me add) on account of this,—lest they
should say, “Thou art alarming and pressing, and constraining us,
applying an axe, and threatening us with being cut down, yet requiring
produce in time of punishment,”—he hath added, to signify
the ease of bearing that fruit, “I indeed baptize you with water,
but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, the latchet of whose
shoe I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you with the Holy
Ghost and with fire:”<note n="483" id="iii.XI-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p56"><scripRef passage="Matt. 3.11; Luke 3.16" id="iii.XI-p56.1" parsed="|Matt|3|11|0|0;|Luke|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.11 Bible:Luke.3.16">Matt. iii. 11.

repeated in the Greek text. Chrysostom (see sec. 6) interprets
“fire” as part of the blessing promised. So many modern
commentators.—R.]</p></note>implying hereby that consideration<note n="484" id="iii.XI-p56.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p57">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p57.1">γνμη</span>.]</p></note>only is needed and faith, not labors and toils; and as it is easy to be
baptized, so is it easy to be converted, and to become better men. So
having stirred their mind by the fear of <i>God’s</i> judgment,
and the expectation of <i>His</i> punishment, and by the mention of the
axe, and by the loss of their ancestors, and by the bringing in of
those other children, and by the double vengeance of cutting off and
burning, and having by all means softened their hardness, and brought
them to desire deliverance from so great evils; then he brings in what

<pb n="68" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_68.html" id="iii.XI-Page_68" />

he hath to say touching Christ; and
not simply, but with a declaration of His great superiority. Then in
setting forth the difference between himself and Him, lest he should
seem to say this out of favor, he establishes the fact by comparison of
the gifts bestowed by each of them. For he did not at once say,
“I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe;” but
when he had first set forth the little value of his own baptism, and
had shown that it hath nothing more than to lead them to repentance
(for he did not say with water of remission, but of repentance), he
sets forth Christ’s also, which is full of the unspeakable gift.
Thus he seems to say, “Lest, on being told that He cometh after
me, thou shouldest despise Him as having come later; learn thou the
virtue<note n="485" id="iii.XI-p57.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p58">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p58.1">δναμιν</span>.]</p></note>of His gift, and thou wilt clearly know that I uttered nothing worthy
nor great, when I said, “I am not worthy to unloose the latchet
of His shoe.” So too when thou art told, “He is mightier
than I,” do not think I said this in the way of making a
comparison. For I am not worthy to be ranked so much as among His
servants, no, not even the lowest of His servants, nor to receive the
least honored portion of His ministry.” Therefore He did not
merely say, “His shoes,” but not even “the
latchet,” which kind of office was counted the last of all. Then
to hinder thy attributing what he had said to humility, he adds also
the proof from the facts: “For He shall baptize you,” saith
he, “with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p59">6. Seest thou how great is the wisdom of the Baptist?
how, when He Himself is preaching, He saith everything to alarm, and
fill them with anxiety; but when He is sending men to Him, whatever was
mild and apt to recover them: not bringing forward the axe, nor the
tree that is cut down and burnt, and cast into the fire, nor the wrath
to come, but remission of sins, and removing of punishment, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, and adoption, and
brotherhood, and a partaking of the inheritance, and an abundant supply
of the Holy Ghost. For all these things he obscurely denoted, when he
said, “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost;” at once,
by the very figure of speech, declaring the abundance of the grace (for
he said not, “He will give you the Holy Ghost,” but
“He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost”); and by the
specification of fire on the other hand indicating the vehement and
uncontrollable quality of His grace.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p60">Imagine only what sort of men it was meet for the
hearers to become, when they considered that they were at once to be
like the prophets, and like those great ones. For it was on this
account, you see, that he made mention at all of fire; that he might
lead them to reflect on the memory of those men. Because, of all the
visions that appeared unto them, I had almost said, the more part
appeared in fire; thus God discoursed with Moses in the bush, thus with
all the people in the mount Sinai, thus with Ezekiel on the
cherubim.<note n="486" id="iii.XI-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p61"><scripRef passage="Ezek. i. 27" id="iii.XI-p61.1" parsed="|Ezek|1|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.1.27">Ezek. i.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p62">And mark again how he rouses the hearer, by putting that
first which was to take place after all. For the Lamb was to be slain,
and sin to be blotted out, and the enmity to be destroyed, and the
burial to take place, and the resurrection, and then the Spirit to
come. But none of these things doth he mention as yet, but that first
which was last, and for the sake of which all the former were done, and
which was fittest to proclaim His dignity; so that when the hearer
should be told that he was to receive so great a Spirit he might search
with himself, how and in what manner this shall be, while sin so
prevails; that finding him full of thought and prepared for that
lesson, he might thereupon introduce what he had to say touching the
Passion, no man being any more offended, under the expectation of such
a gift.</p>

message, and soothed and relaxed the hearer, he again binds him up,
that he may not become remiss. For such was the nature of the Jewish
nation; by all encouraging things they were easily puffed up, and
corrupted. Wherefore he again adduces his terrors, saying, “Whose

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p71">Thus, as before he had spoken of the punishment, so here
he points out the Judge likewise, and introduces the eternal vengeance.
For “He will burn the chaff,” saith he, “with
unquenchable fire.” Thou seest that He is Lord of all things, and
that He is Himself the Husbandman; albeit in another place He calls His
Father the same. For “My Father,” saith He, “is the
Husbandman.”<note n="492" id="iii.XI-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p72"><scripRef passage="John xv. 1" id="iii.XI-p72.1" parsed="|John|15|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.1">John xv.

that the thing needed labor, and the separation was hard to make; by
another comparison he suggests the easiness of it, implying that all
the world is His; since He could not punish those who were not His own.
For the present, it is true, all are mingled together (for though the
wheat appears gleaming through, yet it lies with the chaff, as on a
threshing floor, not as in a garner), but then, great will be the
separation.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p73">Where now are they by whom hell-fire<note n="493" id="iii.XI-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p74">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p74.1">γενν</span>.]</p></note>is disbelieved? Since surely here are two points laid down, one, that
He will baptize with the Holy Ghost, the other, that He will burn up
the disobedient. If then that is credible, so is this too, assuredly.
Yea, this is why the two predictions are put by him in immediate
connection, that by that which hath taken place already, he might
accredit the other, as yet unaccomplished. For Christ too Himself in
many places doth so, often of the same things, and often of opposites,
setting down two prophecies; the one of which He performs here, the
other He promises in the future; that such as are too contentious may,
from the one which has already come to pass, believe the other also,
which is not yet accomplished. For instance, to them that strip
themselves of all that they have for His sake<note n="494" id="iii.XI-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p75"><scripRef passage="Mark x. 30; Luke xviii. 30" id="iii.XI-p75.1" parsed="|Mark|10|30|0|0;|Luke|18|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.10.30 Bible:Luke.18.30">Mark x. 30;
Luke xviii. 30</scripRef>.</p></note> He promised to give an hundred fold in the present world, and life
eternal in that which is to come; by the things already given making
the future also credible. Which, as we see, John likewise hath done in
this place; laying down two things, that He shall both baptize with the
Holy Ghost, and burn up with unquenchable fire. Now then, if He had not
baptized with the Spirit the apostles, and all every day who are
willing, thou mightest have doubts concerning those other things too;
but if that which seems to be greater and more difficult, and which
transcends all reason, hath been done, and is done every day; how
deniest thou that to be true, which is easy, and comes to pass
according to reason? Thus having said, “He shall baptize with the
Holy Ghost and with fire,” and having thence promised great
blessings; lest thou, released wholly from the former things, grow
supine, he hath added the fan, and the judgment thereby declared. Thus,
“think not at all,” saith he, “that your baptism
suffices, if ye become ordinary persons<note n="495" id="iii.XI-p75.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p76">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p76.1">φαλοι</span>,
“worthless.”—R.]</p></note>hereafter:” for we need both virtue, and plenty of that known
self-restraint.<note n="496" id="iii.XI-p76.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p77"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p77.1">φιλοσοφα</span>.</p></note> Therefore as by the axe he urges them unto grace, and unto the font, so
after grace he terrifies them by the fan, and the unquenchable fire.
And of the one sort, those yet unbaptized, he makes no distinction, but
saith in general, “Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit
is hewn down,”<note n="497" id="iii.XI-p77.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p78"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 10" id="iii.XI-p78.1" parsed="|Matt|3|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.10">Matt. iii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note>punishing all the unbelievers. Whereas after baptism He works out a
kind of division, because many of them that believed would exhibit a
life unworthy of their faith.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p79">Let no man then become chaff, let no one be tossed to
and fro, nor lie exposed to wicked desires, blown about by them easily
every way. For if thou continue wheat, though temptation be brought on
thee, thou wilt suffer nothing dreadful; nay, for in the threshing
floor, the wheels of the car, that are like saws,<note n="498" id="iii.XI-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p80"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p80.1">πριστηροειδ</span>,

of chaff, thou wilt both here suffer incurable ills, being smitten of
all men, and there thou wilt undergo the eternal punishment. For all
such persons both before that furnace become food for the irrational
passions here, as chaff is for the brute animal: and there again they
are material and food for the flame.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p81">Now to have said directly that He will judge men’s
doings, would not so effectually procure acceptance for His doctrine:
but to blend with it the parable, and so establish it all, was apter to
persuade the hearer, and attract him by a more ample encouragement.
Wherefore also Christ Himself<note n="499" id="iii.XI-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p82">[The better supported text seems to be <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p82.1">ατς</span>, without <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p82.2">ὁ

and harvest, and vineyard, and
wine-press, and field, and net, and fishing, and all things familiar,
and among which they were busied He makes ingredients in His
discourses. This kind of thing then the Baptist likewise did here, and
offered an exceeding great demonstration of his words, the giving of
the Spirit. For “He who hath so great power, as both to forgive
sins, and to give the Spirit, much more will these things also be
within His power:” so he speaks.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p86">“And wherefore,” it may be said, “did
he not mention the signs and wonders which were straightway to be done
by Him?” Because this was greater than all, and for its sake all
those were done. Thus, in his mention of the chief thing, he
comprehended all; death dissolved, sins abolished, the curse blotted
out, those long wars done away; our entrance into paradise,<note n="502" id="iii.XI-p86.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p87">[“The loosing of death, the abolition of
sins,” etc., “the entrance into Paradise,” etc. The
construction is the same throughout the list.—R.]</p></note>our ascent into heaven, our citizenship with the angels, our partaking
of the good things to come: for in truth this is the earnest of them
all. So that in mentioning this, he hath mentioned also the
resurrection of our bodies, and the manifestation of His miracles here,
and our partaking of His kingdom, and the good things, which “eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of
man.”<note n="503" id="iii.XI-p87.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p88"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 9" id="iii.XI-p88.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.9">1 Cor. ii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> For all these things He bestowed on us by that gift. It was therefore
superfluous to speak of the signs that were immediately to ensue, and
which sight can judge of; but those were meet to be discoursed on,
whereof they doubted; as for instance, that He is the Son of God; that
He exceeds John beyond comparison; that He “beareth<note n="504" id="iii.XI-p88.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p89">[See note 3 on sec. 6, p. 71.—R.]</p></note>the sin of the world;” that He will require an account of all
that we do; that our interests are not limited to the present, but
elsewhere every one will undergo the due penalty. For these things were
not as yet proveable by sight.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p90">8. Therefore, knowing these things, let us use great
diligence, while we are in the threshing floor; for it is possible
while we are here, to change even out of chaff into wheat, even as on
the other hand many from wheat have become chaff. Let us not then be
supine, nor be carried about with every wind; neither let us separate
ourselves from our brethren, though they seem to be small and mean;
forasmuch as the wheat also compared with the chaff is less in measure,
but better in nature. Look not therefore to the forms of outward pomp,
for they are prepared for the fire, but to this godly humility, so firm
and indissoluble, and which cannot be cut, neither is burnt by the
fire. It being for their sake that He bears long with the very chaff,
that by their intercourse with them they may become better. Therefore
judgment is not yet, that we may be all crowned together, that from
wickedness many may be converted unto virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p91">Let us tremble then at hearing this parable. For indeed
that fire is unquenchable. “And how,” it may be said,
“is it unquenchable?” Seest thou not this sun ever burning,
and never quenched? didst thou not behold the bush burning, and not
consumed? If then thou also desirest to escape the flame, lay up alms
beforehand, and so thou wilt not even taste of that fire. For if, while
here, thou wilt believe what is told thee, thou shalt not so much as
see this furnace, after thy departure into that region; but if thou
disbelieve it now, thou shalt know it there full well by experience,
when no sort of escape is possible. Since in truth no entreaty shall
avert the punishment from them who have not shown forth an upright
life. For believing surely is not enough, since even the devils tremble
at God, but for all that they will be punished.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p92">9. Wherefore our care of our conduct hath need to be
great. Why, this is the very reason of our continually assembling you
here; not simply that ye should enter in, but that ye should also reap
some fruit from your continuance here. But if ye come indeed
constantly, but go away again reaping no fruit from thence, ye will
have no advantage from your entering in and attendance in this
place.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p93">For if we, when sending children to teachers, should we
see them reaping no benefit thereby, begin to be severe in blaming the
teachers, and remove them often to others; what excuse shall we have
for not bestowing upon virtue even so much diligence as upon these
earthly things, but forever bringing our tablets home empty? And yet
our teachers here are more in number and greater. For no less than
prophets and apostles and patriarchs, and all righteous men, are by us
set over you as teachers in every Church. And not even so is there any
profit, but if you have joined in chanting two or three Psalms, and
making the accustomed prayers at random and anyhow, are so dismissed,
ye think this enough for your salvation. Have ye not heard the prophet,
saying (or rather God by the prophet), “This people honoreth me

<pb n="71" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_71.html" id="iii.XI-Page_71" />

with their lips, but their heart
is far from me?”<note n="505" id="iii.XI-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p94"><scripRef passage="Isa. 29.13; Mark 7.6" id="iii.XI-p94.1" parsed="|Isa|29|13|0|0;|Mark|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.29.13 Bible:Mark.7.6">Is. xxix. 13; comp. Mark vii. 6</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p95">Therefore, lest this be our case too, wipe thou out the
letters, or rather the impressions, which the devil hath engraven in
thy soul; and bring me a heart set free from worldly tumults, that
without fear I may write on it what I will. Since now at least there is
nothing else to discern, except his letters;—rapines, covetings,
envy, jealousy. Wherefore of course, when I receive your tablets, I am
not able so much as to read them. For I find not the letters, which we
every Lord’s day inscribe on you, and so let you go; but others,
instead of these, unintelligible and misshapen. Then, when we have
blotted them out, and have written those which are of the Spirit, ye
departing, and giving up your hearts to the works of the devil, give
him again power to substitute his own characters in you. What then will
be the end of all this, even without any words of mine, each
man’s own conscience knoweth. For I indeed will not cease to do
my part, and to write in you the right letters. But if ye mar our
diligence, for our part our reward is unaltered, but your danger is not
small.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p96">Now, though I would fain say nothing to disgust you, yet
I beseech again and entreat you,<note n="506" id="iii.XI-p96.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p97">[The first clause stands independently in the Greek
text, forming the conclusion of the preceding paragraph. The new
exhortation begins, “But I beseech again,”
etc.—R.]</p></note>imitate at least the little children’s diligence in these
matters. For so they first learn the form of the letters, after that
they practise themselves in distinguishing them put out of shape, and
then at last in their reading they proceed orderly by means of them.
Just so let us also do; let us divide virtue, and learn first not to
swear, nor to forswear ourselves, nor to speak evil; then proceeding to
another row,<note n="507" id="iii.XI-p97.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XI-p98"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XI-p98.1">στχον</span>.</p></note>not to envy, not to lust, not to be gluttonous, not to be drunken, not
fierce, not slothful, so that from these we may pass on again to the
things of the Spirit, and practise continence, and neglect of the
belly, temperance, righteousness, to be above glory, and gentle and
contrite in mind; and let us join these one with another, and write
them upon our soul.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p99">10. And all these let us practise at home, with our own
friends, with our wife, with our children. And, for the present, let us
begin with the things that come first, and are easier; as for instance,
with not swearing; and let us practise this one letter continually at
home. For, in truth, there are many at home to hinder this our
practice; sometimes a man’s servant provoking him, sometimes his
wife annoying and angering him, sometimes an indocile and disorderly
child urges him on to threatening and swearing. If now at home, when
thus continually galled, thou shouldest attain not to be tempted into
swearing, thou wilt in the market-place also have power with ease to
abide unconquered.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p100">Yea, and in like sort, thou wilt attain to keep thyself
from insulting any, by not insulting thy wife, nor thy servants, nor
any one else among those in thy house. For a man’s wife too not
seldom, praising this or that person, or bemoaning herself, stirs him
up to speak evil of that other. But do not thou let thyself be
constrained to speak evil of him that is praised, but bear it all
nobly. And if thou shouldest perceive thy servants praising other
masters, be not perturbed, but stand nobly. Let thy home be a sort of
lists, a place of exercise for virtue, that having trained thyself well
there, thou mayest with entire skill encounter all abroad.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p101">Do this with respect to vainglory also. For if thou
train thyself not to be vainglorious in company of thy wife and thy
servants, thou wilt not ever afterwards be easily caught by this
passion with regard to any one else. For though this malady be in every
case grievous and tyrannical, yet is it so especially when a woman is
present. If we therefore in that instance put down its power, we shall
easily master it in the other cases also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p102">And with respect to the other passions too, let us do
this self-same thing, exercising ourselves against them at home, and
anointing ourselves every day.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p103">And that our exercise may be easier, let us further
enact a penalty for ourselves, upon our transgressing any of our
purposes. And let the very penalty again be such as brings with it not
loss, but reward,—such as procures some very great gain. And this
is so, if we sentence ourselves to intenser fastings, and to sleeping
often on the bare ground, and to other like austerity. For in this way
will much profit come unto us from every quarter; we shall both live
the sweet life of virtue here, and we shall attain unto the good things
to come and be perpetually friends of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p104">But in order that the same may not happen
again,—that ye may not, having here admired what is said, go your
way, and cast aside at random, wherever it may chance, the tablet of
your mind, and so allow the devil to blot out these things;—let
each one, on returning home, call his own wife, and tell her these
things, and take her to help him; and from this day let him enter into
that noble school of exercise, using for oil the supply of the

<pb n="72" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_72.html" id="iii.XI-Page_72" />

Spirit. And though thou fall once, twice,
many times in thy training, despair not, but stand again, and wrestle;
and do not give up until thou hast bound on thee the glorious crown of
triumph over the devil, and hast for the time to come stored up the
riches of virtue in an inviolable treasure-house.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XI-p105">For if thou shouldest establish thyself in the habits of
this noble self-restraint, then, not even when remiss, wilt thou be
able to transgress any of the commandments, habit imitating the
solidity of nature. Yea, as to sleep is easy, and to eat, and to drink,
and to breathe, so also will the deeds of virtue be easy to us, and we
shall reap to ourselves that pure pleasure, resting in a harbor without
a wave, and enjoying continual calm, and with a great freight bringing
our vessel into haven, in that City, on that day; and we shall attain
unto the undecaying crowns, unto which may we all attain, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory and
might, now and always, and world without end. Amen.</p>

baptized, and to come with the rest to His servant. For the amazement
lay in that one thing, that being God, He would be made Man; but the
rest after this all follows in course of reason.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p5">For this cause, let me add, John also by way of
anticipation said all that he had said before, that he “was not
worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe;” and all the rest, as
for instance, that He is Judge, and rewards every man according to his
desert, and that He will bestow His Spirit abundantly on all; in order
that when thou shouldest see Him coming to the baptism, thou mightest
not suspect anything mean. Therefore he forbids Him, even when He was
come, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p6">“I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest
Thou to me.”<note n="508" id="iii.XII-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p7"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 14" id="iii.XII-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.14">Matt. iii.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> For, because the baptism was “of repentance,” and led men
to accuse themselves for their offenses, lest any one should suppose
that He too “cometh to Jordan” in this sort of mind, John
sets it right beforehand, by calling Him both Lamb, and Redeemer from
all the sin that is in the world. Since He that was able to take away
the sins of the whole race of men, much more was He Himself without
sin. For this cause then he said not, “Behold, He that is without
sin,” but what was much more, He “that beareth the sin of
the world,” in order that together with this truth thou mightest
receive that other with all assurance, and having received it mightest
perceive, that in the conduct of some further economy He cometh to the
baptism. Wherefore also he said to Him when He came, “I have need
to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p8">And he said not, “And art Thou baptized of
me?” nay, for this he feared to say: but what? “And comest
Thou to me?” What then doth Christ? What He did afterwards with
respect to Peter, this did He then also. For so he too would have
forbidden Him to wash his feet, but when he had heard, “What I do
thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter,” and
“thou hast no part with me,”<note n="509" id="iii.XII-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p9"><scripRef passage="John xiii. 7, 8" id="iii.XII-p9.1" parsed="|John|13|7|13|8" osisRef="Bible:John.13.7-John.13.8">John xiii.
7, 8</scripRef>.</p></note>he speedily withdrew from his determination, and went over to the
contrary. And this man again in like manner, when he had heard,
“Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
righteousness,”<note n="510" id="iii.XII-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 15" id="iii.XII-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.15">Matt. iii.

<i>it</i> (or <i>me</i>) now, for thus it becometh,”
etc.—R.]</p></note>straightway obeyed. For they were not unduly contentious, but they
manifested

<pb n="73" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_73.html" id="iii.XII-Page_73" />

both love and obedience,
and made it their study to be ruled by their Lord in all things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p11">And mark how He urges him on that very ground which
chiefly caused him to look doubtfully on what was taking place; in that
He did not say, “thus it is just,” but “thus it
becometh.” For, inasmuch as the point unworthy of Him was in his
mind chiefly this, His being baptized by His servant, He stated this
rather than anything else, which is directly opposed to that
impression: as though He had said, “Is it not as unbecoming that
thou avoidest and forbiddest this? nay, for this self-same cause I bid
thee suffer it, that it is becoming, and that in the highest
degree.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p12">And He did not merely say, “suffer,” but He
added, “now.” “For it will not be so forever,”
saith He, “but thou shalt see me such as thou desirest; for the
present, however, endure this.” Next He shows also how this
“becometh” Him. How then doth it so? “In that we
fulfill the whole law;” and to express this He said, “all
righteousness.” For righteousness is the fulfilling of the
commandments. “Since then we have performed all the rest of the
commandments,” saith He, “and this alone remains, it also
must be added: because I am come to do away the curse that is appointed
for the transgression of the law. I must therefore first fulfill it
all, and having delivered you from its condemnation, in this way bring
it to an end. It becometh me therefore to fulfill the whole law, by the
same rule that it becometh me to do away the curse that is written
against you in the law: this being the very purpose of my assuming
flesh, and coming hither.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p13">2. “Then he suffereth Him. And Jesus, when He was
baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and, lo, the heavens
were opened unto Him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a
dove, and lighting upon Him.”<note n="511" id="iii.XII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 15, 16" id="iii.XII-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|3|15|3|16" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.15-Matt.3.16">Matt. iii.
15, 16</scripRef>. [R.V., “from
the water,” and “coming” for
“lighting.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p15">For inasmuch as many supposed that John was greater than
He, because John had been brought up all his time in the wilderness,
and was son of a chief priest, and was clothed with such raiment, and
was calling all men unto his baptism, and had been born of a barren
mother; while Jesus, first of all, was of a damsel of ordinary rank
(for the virgin birth was not yet manifest to all); and besides, He had
been brought up in an house, and held converse with all men, and wore
this common raiment; they suspected Him to be less than John, knowing
as yet nothing of those secret things;—and it fell out moreover
that He was baptized of John, which thing added support to this
surmise, even if none of those mentioned before had existed; for it
would come into their mind that this man was one of the many (for were
He not one of the many, He would not have come with the many to the
baptism), but that John was greater than He and far more
admirable:—in order therefore that this opinion might not prevail
with the multitude, the very heavens are opened, when He is baptized,
and the Spirit comes down, and a voice with the Spirit, proclaiming the
dignity of the Only Begotten. For since the voice that said,
“This is my beloved Son,” would seem to the multitude
rather to belong to John, for It added not, “This that is
baptized,” but simply <i>This</i>, and every hearer would
conceive it to be said concerning the baptizer, rather than the
baptized, partly on account of the Baptist’s own dignity, partly
for all that hath been mentioned; the Spirit came in form of a dove,
drawing the voice towards Jesus, and making it evident to all, that
<i>This</i> was not spoken of John that baptized, but of Jesus who was
baptized.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p16">And how was it, one may say, that they did not believe,
when these things came to pass? Because in the days of Moses also many
wonderful works were done, albeit not such as these; and after all
those, the voices, and the trumpets, and the lightnings, they both
forged a calf, and “were joined unto Baal-peor.” And those
very persons too, who were present at the time, and saw Lazarus arise,
so far from believing in Him, who had wrought these things, repeatedly
attempted even to slay Him. Now if seeing before their eyes one rise
from the dead, they were so wicked, why marvel at their not receiving a
voice wafted from above? Since when a soul is uncandid and perverse,
and possessed by the disease of envy, it yields to none of these
things; even as when it is candid it receives all with faith, and hath
no great need of these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p17">Speak not therefore thus, “They believed
not,” but rather inquire, “Did not all things take place
which ought to have made them believe?” For by the prophet also
God frames this kind of defense of His own ways in general. That is,
the Jews being on the point of ruin, and of being given over to extreme
punishment; lest any from their wickedness should calumniate His
providence, He saith, “What ought I to have done to this
vineyard, that I have not done?”<note n="512" id="iii.XII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p18"><scripRef passage="Is. v. 4" id="iii.XII-p18.1" parsed="|Isa|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.5.4">Is. v.

his argument.—R.]</p></note> Just so

<pb n="74" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_74.html" id="iii.XII-Page_74" />

here likewise do thou
reflect; “what ought to have been done, and was not done?”
And indeed whensoever arguments arise on God’s Providence, do
thou make use of this kind of defense, against those who from the
wickedness of the many try to raise a prejudice against it. See, for
instance, what astonishing things are done, preludes of those which
were to come; for it is no more paradise, but Heaven that is
opened.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p19">But let our argument with the Jews stand over unto some
other time; for the present, God working with us, we would direct our
discourse to what is immediately before us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p20">3. “And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up
straightway out of the water; and lo! the heavens were opened unto
Him.”<note n="513" id="iii.XII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 16" id="iii.XII-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|3|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.16">Matt. iii.
16</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p22">Wherefore were the heavens opened? To inform thee that
at thy baptism also this is done, God calling thee to thy country on
high, and persuading thee to have nothing to do with earth. And if thou
see not, yet never doubt it. For so evermore at the beginnings of all
wonderful and spiritual transactions, sensible visions appear, and
such-like signs, for the sake of them that are somewhat dull in
disposition, and who have need of outward sight, and who cannot at all
conceive an incorporeal nature, but are excited only by the things that
are seen: that so, though afterward no such thing occur, what hath been
declared by them once for all at the first may be received by thy
faith.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p23">For in the case of the apostles too, there was a
“sound of a mighty wind,”<note n="514" id="iii.XII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p24"><scripRef passage="Acts ii. 2" id="iii.XII-p24.1" parsed="|Acts|2|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.2">Acts ii.
2</scripRef>.</p></note>and visions of fiery tongues appeared, but not for the apostles’
sake, but because of the Jews who were then present. Nevertheless, even
though no sensible signs take place, we receive the things that have
been once manifested by them. Since the dove itself at that time
therefore appeared, that as in place of a finger (so to say) it might
point out to them that were present, and to John, the Son of God. Not
however merely on this account, but to teach thee also, that upon thee
no less at thy baptism the Spirit comes. But since then we have no need
of sensible vision, faith sufficing instead of all. For signs are
“not for them that believe, but for them that believe
not.”<note n="515" id="iii.XII-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p25"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiv. 22" id="iii.XII-p25.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.22">1 Cor. xiv.
22</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p26">But why in the fashion of a dove? Gentle is that
creature, and pure. Forasmuch then as the Spirit too is “a Spirit
of meekness,”<note n="516" id="iii.XII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p27"><scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 1" id="iii.XII-p27.1" parsed="|Gal|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.1">Gal. vi.

a suggestion of the influence of the Holy Spirit.—R.]</p></note> He therefore appears in this sort. And besides, He is reminding us of
an ancient history. For so, when once a common shipwreck had overtaken
the whole world, and our race was in danger of perishing, this creature
appeared, and indicated the deliverance from the tempest, and bearing
an olive branch,<note n="517" id="iii.XII-p27.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p28"><scripRef passage="Gen. viii" id="iii.XII-p28.1" parsed="|Gen|8|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.8">Gen.
viii</scripRef>.</p></note>published the good tidings of the common calm of the whole world; all
which was a type of the things to come. For in fact the condition of
men was then much worse, and they deserved a much sorer punishment. To
prevent thy despairing, therefore, He reminds thee of that history.
Because then also, when things were desperate, there was a sort of
deliverance and reformation; but then by punishment, now, on the
contrary, by grace and an unspeakable gift.<note n="518" id="iii.XII-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p29"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 15" id="iii.XII-p29.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.15">2 Cor. ix.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> Therefore the dove also appears, not bearing an olive branch, but
pointing out to us our Deliverer from all evils, and suggesting the
gracious hopes. For not from out of an ark doth she lead one man only,
but the whole world she leads up into heaven at her appearing, and
instead of a branch of peace from an olive, she conveys the adoption to
all the world’s offspring in common.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p30">Reflect now on the greatness of the gift, and do not
account His dignity the less for His appearing in such a likeness. For
I actually hear some saying,<note n="519" id="iii.XII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p31"><i>i.e</i>., the Macedonians, who were censured at
Constantinople, A.D. 381.</p></note>that “such as is the difference between a man and a dove, so
great is that between Christ and the Spirit: since the one appeared in
our nature, the other in the likeness of a dove.” What must we
say then to these things? That the Son of God did indeed take upon Him
the nature of man, but the Spirit took not on Him the nature of a dove.
Therefore the evangelist also said not, “in the nature of a
dove,” but “in the form of a dove.” Accordingly,
never after did He so much as appear in this fashion, but at that
moment only. And if on this account thou affirmest His dignity to be
less, the cherubim too will be made out by this reasoning much His
superior, even as much so as an eagle is to a dove: because they too
were figured into that visible shape. And the angels too superior
again, for they no less have many times appeared in the fashion of men.
But these things are not so, indeed they are not. For the truth of an
economy is one thing, and the condescension of a temporary vision
another.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p32">Do not now, I pray thee, become unthankful towards thy
Benefactor nor with the very contraries<note n="520" id="iii.XII-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p33">“The contraries:” for whereas the Spirit
came to exalt, and make us partakers of the Divine Nature, the heretics
would degrade Him to something like our own.</p></note>requite Him that hath bestowed

<pb n="75" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_75.html" id="iii.XII-Page_75" />

on
thee the fountain of blessedness. For where adoption is vouchsafed,
there is also the removing of evils, and the giving of all good
things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p34">4. On this very account the Jewish baptism ceases, and
ours takes its beginning. And what was done with regard to the
Passover, the same ensues in the baptism also. For as in that case too,
He acting with a view to both, brought the one to an end, but to the
other He gave a beginning: so here, having fulfilled the Jewish
baptism, He at the same time opens also the doors of that of the
Church; as on one table then, so in one river now, He had both sketched
out the shadow, and now adds the truth. For this baptism alone hath the
grace of the Spirit, but that of John was destitute of this gift. For
this very cause in the case of the others that were baptized no such
thing came to pass, but only in the instance of Him who was to hand
on<note n="521" id="iii.XII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p35">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XII-p35.1">παραδιδναι</span>;
“hand down” would express the sense more
clearly.—R.]</p></note>this; in order that, besides what we have said, thou mightest learn
this also, that not the purity of the baptizer, but the power of the
baptized, had this effect. Not until then, assuredly, were either the
heavens opened, nor did the Spirit make His approach.<note n="522" id="iii.XII-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p36">[The sentence in the Greek is not negative but
affirmative: “Then assuredly” both these events
occurred.—R.]</p></note> Because henceforth He leads us away from the old to the new polity,
both opening to us the gates on high, and sending down His Spirit from
thence to call us to our country there; and not merely to call us, but
also with the greatest mark of dignity. For He hath not made us angels
and archangels, but He hath caused us to become “sons of
God,” and “beloved,” and so He draws us on towards
that portion of ours.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p37">Having then all this in thy mind, do thou show forth a
life worthy of the love of Him who calls thee, and of thy citizenship
in that world, and of the honor that is given thee. Crucified as thou
art to the world, and having crucified it to thyself, show thyself with
all strictness a citizen of the city of the heavens. And do not,
because thy body is not translated unto heaven, suppose that thou hast
anything to do with the earth; for thou hast thy Head abiding above.
Yea with this very purpose the Lord, having first come here and having
brought His angels, did then, taking thee with Him, depart thither;
that even before thy going up to that place, thou mightest understand
that it is possible for thee to inhabit earth as it were heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p38">Let us then keep watch over that noble birth, which we
received from the beginning; and let us every day seek more and more
the palaces there, and account all that is here to be a shadow and a
dream. For so, had any king among those on earth, finding thee poor and
a beggar, made thee suddenly his son, never wouldest thou have thought
upon thy cottage, and thy cottage’s mean appointments. Yet surely
in that case the difference is not much. Do not then either in this
case take account of any of the former things, for thou art called unto
much greater. For both He who calls is the Lord of the angels, and the
good things that are given surpass all both word and thought. Since not
from earth to earth doth He remove thee, as the king doth, but from
earth to heaven, and from a mortal nature to an immortal, and to glory
unspeakable, then only possible to be properly manifested, when we
shall actually enjoy it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p39">Now then, having to partake of such blessings, do I see
thee minding money, and clinging to the pomp which is here? And dost
thou not esteem all that is seen to be more vile than beggars rags? And
how wilt thou appear worthy of this honor? And what excuse wilt thou
have to plead? or rather, what punishment wilt thou not have to suffer,
who after so great a gift art running to thy former vomit? For no
longer art thou punished merely as a man, but as a son of God that hath
sinned; and the greatness of thy honor becomes a mean of bringing a
sorer punishment on thee. Since we too punish not equally slaves that
do wrong, and sons committing the same offense; and most of all when
they have received some great kindness from us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p40">For if he who had paradise for his portion, for one
disobedience underwent such dreadful things after his honor; we, who
have received Heaven, and are become joint heirs with the Only
Begotten, what excuse shall we have, for running to the serpent after
the dove? For it will be no longer, “Dust thou art, and unto dust
shalt thou return,”<note n="523" id="iii.XII-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p41"><scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 19" id="iii.XII-p41.1" parsed="|Gen|3|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.19">Gen. iii.

of teeth;” and this with great reason. For he that is not made
better even by so great a benefit, would justly suffer the most
extreme, and a yet more grievous punishment. Elias once opened and shut
Heaven, but

<pb n="76" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_76.html" id="iii.XII-Page_76" />

that was to bring down
rain, and restrain it; whereas to thee the heaven is not so opened, but
in order for thee to ascend thither; and what is yet more, not to
ascend only, but to lead up others also, if thou wilt; such great
confidence and power hath He bestowed on thee in all that is His.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p45">5. Forasmuch then as our house is there, there let us
store up all, and leave nothing here, lest we lose it. For here, though
thou put a lock on it, and doors, and bars, and set thousands of
servants to watch it; though thou get the better of all the crafty
ones, though thou escape the eyes of the envious, the worms, the
wasting that comes of time; which is impossible;—death at any
rate thou wilt never escape, but wilt be deprived of all those things
in one moment of time; and not deprived of them only, but wilt have to
transfer them into the hands often of thy very enemies. Whereas if thou
wouldest transfer them into that house, thou wilt be far above all. For
there is no need to apply either key, or doors, or bars; such is the
virtue<note n="527" id="iii.XII-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p46">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XII-p46.1">δναμι</span> ]</p></note>of that city, so inviolable is this place, and by nature inaccessible
to corruption and all wickedness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p47">How then is it not of the utmost folly, where
destruction and waste is the lot of all that is stored, there to heap
up all, but where things abide untouched and increase, there not to lay
up even the least portion; and this, when we are to live there forever?
For this cause the very heathens<note n="528" id="iii.XII-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XII-p48">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XII-p48.1">῞Ελληνε</span>.]
“Greeks.” But the ecclesiastical use is correctly given in
the translation. In the New Testament, the term was equivalent to
“Gentiles,” as opposed to Jews; but was afterwards applied
to heathen as opposed to Christians. See <span class="c20" id="iii.XII-p48.2">Sophocles</span> <i>Greek Lexicon</i> of the Roman and Byzantine
periods, <i>sub voce</i>.—R.]</p></note>disbelieve the things that we say, since our doings, not our sayings,
are the demonstration which they are willing to receive from us; and
when they see us building ourselves fine houses, and laying out gardens
and baths, and buying fields, they are not willing to believe that we
are preparing for another sort of residence away from our city.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p49">“For if this were so,” say they, “they
would turn to money all they have here, and lay them up beforehand
there;” and this they divine from the things that are done in
this world. For so we see those who are very rich getting themselves
houses and fields and all the rest, chiefly in those cities in which
they are to stay. But we do the contrary; and with all earnest zeal we
get possession of the earth, which we are soon after to leave; giving
up not money only, but even our very blood for a few acres and
tenements: while for the purchase of Heaven we do not endure to give
even what is beyond our wants, and this though we are to purchase it at
a small price, and to possess it forever, provided we had once
purchased it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XII-p50">Therefore I say we shall suffer the utmost punishment,
departing thither naked and poor; or rather it will not be for our own
poverty that we shall undergo these irremediable calamities, but also
for our making others to be such as ourselves. For when heathens see
them that have partaken of so great mysteries earnest about these
matters, much more will they cling themselves to the things heaping
much fire upon our head. For when we, who ought to teach them to
despise all things that appear, do ourselves most of all urge them to
the lust of these things; when shall it be possible for us to be saved,

thorough darkness, and make them more dissolute, what hope shall we
have of salvation? There is none at all; but wailing and gnashing our
teeth, and bound hand and foot, we shall depart into the fire of hell,

freedom from both. Unto which that we also may attain, let us break in
pieces the grievous yoke of avarice, and make ourselves wings toward
Heaven; by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.XIII-p3">“Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the
wilderness, to be tempted of the devil.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XIII-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XIII-p4.1">Then.</span> When? After the descent
of the Spirit, after the voice that was borne from above, and said,
“This is My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” And
what was marvellous, it was of the Holy Spirit; for this, he here
saith, led Him up. For since with a view to our instruction He both did
and underwent all things; He endures also to be led up thither, and to
wrestle against the devil: in order that each of those who are
baptized, if after his baptism he have to endure greater temptations
may not be troubled as if the result were unexpected, but may continue
to endure all nobly, as though it were happening in the natural course
of things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p5">Yea, for therefore thou didst take up arms, not to be
idle, but to fight. For this cause neither doth God hinder the
temptations as they come on, first to teach thee that thou art become
much stronger; next, that thou mayest continue modest neither be
exalted even by the greatness of thy gifts, the temptations having
power to repress thee; moreover, in order that that wicked demon, who
is for a while doubtful about thy desertion of him, by the touchstone
of temptations may be well assured that thou hast utterly forsaken and
fallen from him; fourthly, that thou mayest in this way be made
stronger, and better tempered than any steel; fifthly, that thou mayest
obtain a clear demonstration of the treasures entrusted to thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p6">For the devil would not have assailed thee, unless he
had seen thee brought to greater honor. Hence, for example, from the
beginning, he attacked Adam, because he saw him in the enjoyment of
great dignity. For this reason he arrayed himself against Job, because
he saw him crowned and proclaimed by the God of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p7">How then saith He, “Pray that ye enter not into
temptation.”<note n="530" id="iii.XIII-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p8"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 41" id="iii.XIII-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|26|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.41">Matt. xxvi.

“led up” according to the principle of the Economy;<note n="531" id="iii.XIII-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p9"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p9.1">κατ τν
λγον τ
οκονομα</span>.</p></note>signifying obscurely by this, that we ought not of ourselves to leap
upon it, but being dragged thereto, to stand manfully.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p10">And see whither the Spirit led Him up, when He had taken
Him; not into a city and forum, but into a wilderness. That is, He
being minded to attract the devil, gives him a handle not only by His
hunger, but also by the place. For then most especially doth the devil
assail, when he sees men left alone, and by themselves. Thus did he
also set upon the woman in the beginning, having caught her alone, and
found her apart from her husband. Just as when he sees us with others
and banded together, he is not equally confident, and makes no attack.
Wherefore we have the greatest need on this very account to be flocking
together continually, that we may not be open to the devil’s
attacks.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p11">2. Having then found Him in the wilderness, and in a
pathless wilderness (for that the wilderness was such, Mark hath
declared, saying, that He “was with the wild beasts”<note n="532" id="iii.XIII-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p12"><scripRef passage="Mark i. 13" id="iii.XIII-p12.1" parsed="|Mark|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.1.13">Mark i.
13</scripRef>.</p></note>), behold with how much craft he draws near, and wickedness; and for
what sort of opportunity he watches. For not in his fast, but in his
hunger he approaches Him; to instruct thee how great a good fasting is,
and how it is a most powerful shield against the devil, and that after
the font,<note n="533" id="iii.XIII-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p13">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p13.1">λουντρ</span>, “laver;”
here by metonymy for the rite of baptism.—R.]</p></note>men should give themselves up, not to luxury and drunkenness, and a
full table, but to fasting. For, for this cause even He fasted, not as
needing it Himself, but to instruct us. Thus, since our sins before the
font<note n="534" id="iii.XIII-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p14">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p14.1">λουντρ</span>, “laver;”
here by metonymy for the rite of baptism.—R.]</p></note>were brought in by serving the belly: much as if any one who had made a
sick man whole were to forbid his doing those things, from which the
distemper arose; so we see here likewise that He Himself after the font
brought in fasting. For indeed both Adam by the incontinence of the
belly was cast out of paradise; and the flood in Noah’s time,
this produced; and this brought down the thunders on Sodom. For
although there was also a charge of whoredom, nevertheless from this
grew the root of each of those punishments; which Ezekiel also
signified when he said, “But this was the iniquity of Sodom, that
she waxed wanton in pride and in fullness of bread, and in abundance of
luxury.”<note n="535" id="iii.XIII-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p15"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xvi. 49" id="iii.XIII-p15.1" parsed="|Ezek|16|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.16.49">Ezek. xvi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p17">On this account then even He too fasts forty days,
pointing out to us the medicines of our salvation; yet proceeds no
further, lest on the other hand, through the exceeding greatness of the
miracle the truth of His Economy<note n="537" id="iii.XIII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p18"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p18.1">οκονομα</span>, that is, the
assumption of humanity. [Justin Martyr and Ignatius so use the term;
see reffs. in <span class="c20" id="iii.XIII-p18.2">Sophocles</span>, <i>Greek Lexicon</i>,
etc., <i>sub voce</i>.—R.]</p></note>should be discredited. For as it is, this cannot be, seeing that both
Moses and Elias, anticipating Him, could advance to so great a length
of time, strengthened by the power of God. And if He had proceeded
farther, from this among other things His assumption of our flesh would
have seemed incredible to many.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p19">Having then fasted forty days and as many nights,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p20">“He was afterwards an hungered;<note n="538" id="iii.XIII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 2" id="iii.XIII-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.2">Matt. iv.
2</scripRef>.</p></note>” affording him a point to lay hold of and approach, that by
actual conflict He might show how to prevail and be victorious. Just so
do wrestlers also: when teaching their pupils how to prevail and
overcome, they voluntarily in the lists engage with others, to afford
these in the persons of their antagonists the means of seeing and
learning the mode of conquest. Which same thing then also took place.
For it being His will to draw him on so far, He both made His hunger
known to him, and awaited his approach, and as He waited for him, so He
dashed him to earth, once, twice, and three times, with such ease as
became Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p22">3. But that we may not, by hurrying over these
victories, mar your profit, let us begin from the first assault, and
examine each with exact care.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p23">Thus, after He was an hungered, it is said, “The
tempter came, and said unto Him, If Thou be Son of God, command that
these stones be made bread.”<note n="539" id="iii.XIII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 3" id="iii.XIII-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|4|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.3">Matt. iv.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p25">For, because he had heard a voice borne from above, and
saying, “This is My beloved Son;” and had heard also John
bearing so large witness concerning Him, and after that saw Him an
hungered; he was thenceforth in perplexity, and neither could believe
that He was a mere man, because of the things spoken concerning Him;
nor on the other hand receive it that He was Son of God, seeing Him as
he did in hunger. Whence being in perplexity he utters ambiguous sounds.
And much as when coming to Adam at the beginning, he feigns things that
are not, that he may learn the things that are; even so here also, not
knowing clearly the unutterable mystery of the Economy, and who He may
be that is come, he attempts to weave other nets, whereby he thought to
know that which was hidden and obscure. And what saith he? “If
Thou be Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” He
said not, because thou art an hungered, but, “if Thou be Son of
God;” thinking to cheat Him with his compliments. Wherefore also
he was silent touching the hunger, that he might not seem to be
alleging it, and upbraiding Him. For not knowing the greatness of the
Economy which was going on, he supposed this to be a reproach to Him.
Wherefore flattering Him craftily, he makes mention of His dignity
only.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p26">What then saith Christ? To put down his pride, and to
signify that there was nothing shameful in what had happened, nor
unbecoming His wisdom; that which the other had passed over in silence
to flatter Him, He brings forward and sets it forth, saying, “Man
shall not live by bread alone.”<note n="540" id="iii.XIII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 4" id="iii.XIII-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.4">Matt. iv.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p28">So that He begins with the necessity of the belly. But
mark, I pray thee, the craft of that wicked demon, and whence he begins
his wrestlings, and how he doth not forget his proper art. For by what
means he cast out also the first man, and encompassed him with
thousands of other evils, with the same means here likewise he weaves
his deceit; I mean, with incontinence of the belly. So too even now one
may hear many foolish ones say their bad words by thousands because of
the belly. But Christ, to show that the virtuous man is not compelled
even by this tyranny to do anything that is unseemly, first hungers,
then submits not to what is enjoined Him; teaching us to obey the devil
in nothing. Thus, because the first man did hereby both offend God, and
transgress the law, as much and more doth He teach thee:—though
it be no transgression which he commands, not even so to obey.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p29">And why say I, “transgression”? “Why,
even though something expedient be suggested by the devils,<note n="541" id="iii.XIII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p30">[Here “demons” is the more correct
rendering.—R.]</p></note>do not thou,” saith He, “even so give heed unto
them.” Thus, for instance, He stopped the mouths of those devils<note n="542" id="iii.XIII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p31">[Here “demons” is the more correct
rendering.—R.]</p></note>also, proclaiming Him Son of God. And Paul too again<note n="543" id="iii.XIII-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p32"><scripRef passage="Acts xvi. 18" id="iii.XIII-p32.1" parsed="|Acts|16|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.18">Acts xvi.
18</scripRef>.</p></note>rebuked them, crying this self-same thing; and yet what they said was
profitable; but he more abundantly dishonoring them, and obstructing
their plot against us, drove them away even when doctrines of salvation
were preached by them,

<pb n="79" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_79.html" id="iii.XIII-Page_79" />

closing up
their mouths, and bidding them be silent.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p33">And therefore neither in this instance did He consent to
what was said. But what saith He? “Man shall not live by bread
alone.” Now His meaning is like this: “God is able even by
a word to nourish the hungry man;” bringing him a testimony out
of the ancient Scripture, and teaching us, though we hunger, yea,
whatever we suffer, never to fall away from our Lord.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p34">But if a man say, “still He should have displayed
Himself;” I would ask him, with what intent, and for what reason?
For not at all that he might believe did the other so speak, but that
he might, as he thought, over-argue<note n="544" id="iii.XIII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p35">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p35.1">ἐλγξ</span>, “might convince,”
“argue over.”—R.]</p></note> Him into unbelief. Since the first of mankind were in this way beguiled
and over-argued by him, not putting earnest faith in God. For the
contrary of what God had said he promised them, and puffed them up with
vain hopes, and brought them to unbelief, and so cast them out of the
blessings they actually possessed. But Christ signifies Himself not to
have consented, either to him then or afterwards to the Jews his
partisans, in their demand of signs: invariably instructing us,
whatever we may have power to do, yet to do nothing vainly and at
random; nor even when want urges to obey the devil.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p36">4. What then doth this accursed one? Overcome, and
unable to persuade Him to do his bidding, and that when pressed by such
violent hunger, he proceeds to another thing, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p37">“If Thou be Son of God, cast Thyself down; for it
is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, and in
their hands they shall bear Thee up.”<note n="545" id="iii.XIII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 6" id="iii.XIII-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.6">Matt. iv.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p39">What can the reason be, that at each temptation He adds
this, “If Thou be Son of God?” Much the same as he did in
that former case, he doth also at this time. That is, as he then
slandered God, saying, “In the day ye eat, your eyes shall be
opened;”<note n="546" id="iii.XIII-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p40"><scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 5" id="iii.XIII-p40.1" parsed="|Gen|3|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.5">Gen. iii.
5</scripRef>.</p></note>thereby intending to signify, that they were beguiled and overreached,
and had received no benefit; even so in this case also he insinuates
this same thing, saying, “in vain God hath called Thee Son, and
hath beguiled Thee by His gift; for, if this be not so, afford us some
clear proof that Thou art of that power.” Then, because Christ
had reasoned with him from Scripture, he also brings in a testimony of
the prophet.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p41">How then doth Christ? He is not indignant, nor provoked,
but with that extreme gentleness He reasons with him again from the
Scriptures, saying, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God:”<note n="547" id="iii.XIII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 7" id="iii.XIII-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|4|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.7">Matt. iv.
7</scripRef>.</p></note>teaching us that we must overcome the devil, not by miracles, but by
forbearance and long-suffering, and that we should do nothing at all
for display and vainglory.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p43">But mark thou his folly, even by the very testimony
which he produced. For while the testimonies cited by the Lord were
both of them spoken with exceeding fitness: his, on the other hand,
were chance and random sayings, neither did he bring forward on his
part that which applied to the matter in hand. For that it is written,
“He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee,” this
surely is not advice to dash and toss one’s self down headlong;
and moreover, this was not so much as spoken concerning the Lord.
However, this for the time He did not expose, although there was both
insult in his manner of speech, and great inconsistency. For of
God’s Son no man requires these things: but to cast one’s
self down is the part of the devil, and of demons. Whereas God’s
part is to raise up even them that are down. And if He ought to have
displayed His own power, it would not have been by casting and tossing
Himself down at random, but by saving others. But to cast ourselves
down precipices, and into pits, pertains properly to his troop. Thus,
for example, the juggler among them doth everywhere.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p44">But Christ, even when these things are said, doth not
yet reveal Himself, but as man for a while discourses with him. For the
sayings, “Man shall not live by bread alone;” and,
“Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,” suited one not
greatly revealing Himself, but representing Himself as one of the
many.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p45">But marvel thou not, if he in reasoning with Christ
oftentimes turn himself about. For as pugilists, when they have
received deadly blows, reel about, drenched in much blood, and blinded;
even so he too, darkened by the first and the second blow, speaks at
random what comes uppermost: and proceeds to his third assault.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p46">5. “And he leadeth Him up into a high mountain,
and showeth Him all the kingdoms, and saith, All these things will I
give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith He, Get
thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”<note n="548" id="iii.XIII-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p47"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 8-10" id="iii.XIII-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|4|8|4|10" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.8-Matt.4.10">Matt. iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p48">For since he was now come to sinning against the Father,
saying, that all that is the Father’s was his, and was
endeavoring to

<pb n="80" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_80.html" id="iii.XIII-Page_80" />

make himself out to
be God, as artificer of the universe; He then rebuked him: but not even
then with vehemence, but simply, “Get thee hence, Satan;”
which itself had in it something of command rather than of rebuke. For
as soon as He had said to him, “Get thee hence,” He caused
him to take to flight; since he brought not against Him any other
temptations.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p49">And how saith Luke, that “he ended all
temptation.”<note n="549" id="iii.XIII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p50">[<scripRef passage="Luke iv. 13" id="iii.XIII-p50.1" parsed="|Luke|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.4.13">Luke iv.
13</scripRef>. The form of the passage
is changed by Chrysostom, but the words are identical. The R.V.
renders: “And when the devil had completed every
temptation.” Chrysostom puts the emphasis on the word
“every,” as his argument shows.—R.]</p></note> To me it seems that in mentioning the chief of the temptations, he had
spoken of all, as though the rest too were included in these. For the
things that form the substance of innumerable evils are these: to be a
slave to the belly, to do anything for vainglory, to be in subjection
to the madness of riches. Which accordingly that accursed one
considering, set last the most powerful of all, I mean the desire of
more: and though originally, and from the beginning, he was travailing
to come to this, yet he kept it for the last, as being of more force
than the rest. For in fact this is the manner of his wrestling, to
apply those things last, which seem more likely to overthrow. And this
sort of thing he did with respect to Job likewise. Wherefore in this
instance too, having begun with the motives which seem to be viler and
weaker, he goes on to the more prevailing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p51">How then are we to get the better of him? In the way
which Christ that taught us, by fleeing to God for refuge; and neither
to be depressed in famine, as believing in God who is able to feed even
with a word; nor amidst whatever good things we may receive to tempt
Him who gave them, but to be content with the glory which is from
above, making no account of that which is of men, and on every occasion
to despise what is beyond our need. For nothing doth so make us fall
under the power of the devil, as longing for more, and loving
covetousness. And this we may see even by what is done now. For now
also there are those who say, “All these things will we give
thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship;” who are indeed men by
nature, but have become his instruments. Since at that time too he
approached Him, not by himself only, but also by others. Which Luke
also was declaring, when he said, that “he departed from Him for
a season;”<note n="550" id="iii.XIII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p52"><scripRef passage="Luke iv. 13" id="iii.XIII-p52.1" parsed="|Luke|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.4.13">Luke iv.

distress. For as I have already said, Christ on this occasion exhibits
many things, which we ourselves are to enjoy.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p56">6. Forasmuch then as all these things have been done for
thee, do thou emulate and imitate His victory. And should any one
approach thee of those who are that evil spirit’s servants, and
savor the things that be of him, upbraiding thee and saying, “If
thou art marvellous and great, remove the mountain;” be not
troubled, nor confounded, but answer with meekness, and say some such
thing as thou hast heard thy Lord say: “Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p57">Or should he, offering glory and dominion, and an
endless amount of wealth, enjoin thee to worship him, do thou stand
again manfully. For neither did the devil deal so with the common Lord
of us all only, but every day also he brings these his machinations to
bear on each of His servants, not in mountains only and in
wildernesses, nor by himself: but in cities likewise, in market-places,
and in courts of justice, and by means of our own kindred, even men.
What then must we do? Disbelieve him altogether, and stop our ears
against him, and hate him when he flatters, and when he proffers more,
then so much the more shun him. Because in Eve’s case also, when
he was most lifting her up with hopes, then he cast her down, and did
her the greatest evils. Yea, for he is an implacable enemy, and hath
taken up against us such war as excludes all treaty. And we are not so
earnest for our own salvation, as he is for our ruin. Let us then shun
him, not with words only, but also with works; not in mind only, but
also in deed; and let us do none of the things which he approves, for
so shall we do all those which God approves. Yea, for he makes also
many promises, not that he may give, but that he may take. He promises
by rapine, that he may deprive us of the kingdom, and of righteousness;
and sets treasures in the earth as a kind of gins or

<pb n="81" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_81.html" id="iii.XIII-Page_81" />

traps, that he may deprive us both of these and
of the treasures in Heaven, and he would have us be rich here, that we
may not be rich there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p58">And if he should not be able by wealth to cast us out of
our portion there, he comes another way, the way of poverty; as he did
with respect to Job. That is, when he saw that wealth did him no harm,
he weaves his toils by poverty, expecting on that side to get the
better of him. But what could be more foolish than this? Since he that
hath been able to bear wealth with moderation, much more will he bear
poverty with manliness; and he who desires not riches when present,
neither will he seek them when absent; even as that blessed man did
not, but by his poverty, on the other hand, he became still more
glorious. For of his possessions that wicked demon had power indeed to
deprive him, but his love toward God he not only could not take away,
but made it even stronger, and when he had stripped him of all, he
caused him to abound with more blessings; wherefore also he was in
perplexity. For the more plagues he brought upon him, the more mighty
he then saw him become. And therefore, as you know, when he had gone
through all, and had thoroughly tried his metal,<note n="553" id="iii.XIII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p59"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p59.1">διακωδνισα</span>
.</p></note>because he made no way, he ran to his old weapon, the woman, and
assumes a mask of concern, and makes a tragical picture of his
calamities in most pitiable tone, and feigns that for removal of his
evil he is introducing that deadly counsel.<note n="554" id="iii.XIII-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p60">“Curse God and die,” <scripRef passage="Job ii. 9" id="iii.XIII-p60.1" parsed="|Job|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.2.9">Job ii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> But neither so did he prevail; nay, for his bait was perceived by that
wondrous man, who with much wisdom stopped the mouth of the woman
speaking at his instigation.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p61">Just so we likewise must act: though it be a brother, a
tried friend, a wife, whom you will of those nearest to us, whom he
hath entered into, and so utters something not convenient,<note n="555" id="iii.XIII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p62">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p62.1">τι τν ο
προηκντων</span>.—R.]</p></note>we must not receive the counsel for the person of him who so speaks,
but for the deadly counsel turn away from the speaker. Since in fact
now also he doth many such things, and puts before him a mask of
sympathy, and while he seems to be friendly, he is instilling his
pernicious words, more grievous than poisons. Thus, as to flatter for
evil is his part, so to chastise for our good, is God’s.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p63">7. Let us not then be deceived, neither let us by every
mean seek after the life of ease. For “whom the Lord
loveth,” it is said, “He chasteneth.”<note n="556" id="iii.XIII-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p64"><scripRef passage="Heb. xii. 6" id="iii.XIII-p64.1" parsed="|Heb|12|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.6">Heb. xii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> Wherefore when we enjoy prosperity, living in wickedness, then most of
all should we grieve. For we ought ever to be afraid while we sin, but
especially when we suffer no ill. For when God exacts our penalties by
little and little, he makes our payment for these things easy to us;
but when he is long-suffering for each of our negligences, He is
storing us up, if we continue in such things, unto a great punishment.
Since, if for the well-doers affliction be a necessary thing, much more
for them that sin.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p65">See for instance how much long-suffering Pharaoh met
with, and afterwards underwent for all most extreme punishment: in how
many things Nebuchadnezzar offended, yet at the end expiated all; and
the rich man, because he had suffered no great ill here, for this very
cause chiefly became miserable, for that having lived in luxury in the
present life, he departed to pay the penalty of all these things there,
where he could not obtain anything at all to soothe his calamity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p66">Yet for all this some are so cold and senseless, as to
be always seeking only the things that are here, and uttering those
absurd sayings, “Let me enjoy all things present for a time, and
then I will consider about things out of sight: I will gratify my
belly, I will be a slave to pleasures, I will make full use of the
present life; give me to-day, and take tomorrow.” Oh excess of
folly! Why, wherein do they who talk so differ from goats and swine?
For if the prophet<note n="557" id="iii.XIII-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p67"><scripRef passage="Jerem. v. 8" id="iii.XIII-p67.1" parsed="|Jer|5|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.5.8">Jerem. v.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>permits not them to be accounted men, that “neigh after their
neighbors wife,” who shall blame us for esteeming these to be
goats and swine, and more insensible than asses, by whom those things
are held uncertain, which are more evident than what we see? Why, if
thou believest nothing else, attend to the devils in their scourging,
to them who had our hurt for their object in all their practice, both
in word and deed. For thou wilt not, I am sure, contradict this, that
they do all to increase our security, and to do away with the fear of
hell, and to breed disbelief of the tribunals in that world.
Nevertheless, they that are so minded, by cryings and wailings do
oftentimes proclaim the torments that are there.<note n="558" id="iii.XIII-p67.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p68">St. Cyril (about A.D. 350) Catech. x. 19, says,
“The demons who even to this day are being driven out by the
faithful bear witness to Christ.” St. Augustin (A.D. 426), in
many places speaks of the like miracle as no unusual thing in his time,
particularly at the tombs of the martyrs. <i>De Civ. Dei</i>. x. 22.;
xxii. 8; contra. <i>Lit. Petil</i>. ii. 55.</p></note> Whence is it then that they so speak, and utter things contrary to
their own will? From no other cause, but because they are under the
pressure of stronger compulsion. For they would have not been minded of
their own accord to confess either that they

<pb n="82" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_82.html" id="iii.XIII-Page_82" />

are tormented by dead men, or that they at all suffer
anything dreadful.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p69">Wherefore now have I said this? Because evil demons
confess hell, who would fain have hell disbelieved; but thou who
enjoyest honor so great, and hast been a partaker in unutterable
mysteries, dost not so much as imitate them, but art become more
hardened even than they.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p70">8. “But who,” one will say, “hath come
from those in hell, and hath declared these things?” Why, who
hath arrived here from heaven, and told us that there is a God who
created all things? And whence is it clear that we have a soul? For
plainly, if thou art to believe the things only that are in sight, both
God and angels, and mind and soul, will be matter of doubting to thee,
and in this way thou wilt find all the doctrines of the truth gone.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p71">Yet surely, if thou art willing to believe what is
evident, the things invisible ought to be believed by thee, rather than
those which are seen. Even though what I say be a paradox, nevertheless
it is true, and among men of understanding is fully acknowledged. For
whereas the eyes are often deceived, not in the things unseen only (for
of those they do not so much as take cognizance), but even in those
which men think they actually see, distance and atmosphere, and absence
of mind, and anger, and care, and ten thousand other things impeding
their accuracy; the reasoning power of the soul on the other hand, if
it receive the light of the divine Scriptures, will prove a more
accurate, an unerring standard of realities.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p72">Let us not then vainly deceive ourselves, neither in
addition to the carelessness of our life, which is the offspring of
such doctrines as these, heap up to ourselves, for the very doctrines
themselves, a more grievous fire. For if there be no judgment, and we
are not to give account of our deeds, neither shall we receive rewards
for our labors. Observe which way your blasphemies tend, when ye say,
that God, who is righteous, and loving, and mild, overlooks so great
labors and toils. And how can this be reasonable? Why, if by nothing
else, at any rate by the circumstances of thine own house, I bid thee
weigh these things, and then thou wilt see the absurdity. For though
thou wert thyself savage and inhuman beyond measure, and wilder than
the very wild beasts, thou wouldest not choose at thy death to leave
unhonored the servant that had been affectionate to thee, but requitest
him both with freedom, and with a gift of money; and forasmuch as in
thine own person hereafter, having departed, thou wilt be able to do
him no good, thou givest charge concerning him to the future inheritors
of thy substance, beseeching, exhorting, doing everything, so that he
may not remain unrewarded.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p73">So then thou, who art evil, art so kind and loving
towards thy servant; and will the Infinite Goodness, that is, God, the
Unspeakable Love to man, the kindness so vast: will He overlook and
leave uncrowned His own servants, Peter and Paul, and James, and John,
those who every day for His sake suffered hunger, were bound, were
scourged, were drowned in the sea, were given up to wild beasts, were
dying, were suffering so great things as we cannot so much as reckon
up? And whereas the Olympic judge proclaims and crowns the victor, and
the master rewards the servant, and the king the soldier, and each in
general him that hath done him service, with what good things he can;
shall God alone, after those so great toils and labors, repay them with
no good thing great or small? shall those just and pious men, who have
walked in every virtue, lie in the same state with adulterers, and
parricides, and manslayers, and violators of tombs? And in what way can
this be reasonable? Since, if there be nothing after our departure
hence, and our interests reach no further than things present, those
are in the same case with these, or rather not so much as in the same.
For what though hereafter, as thou sayest, they fare alike? yet here,
the whole of their time, the wicked have been at ease, the righteous in
chastisement. And this what sort of tyrant, what savage and relentless
man did ever so devise, touching his own servants and subjects?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p74">Didst thou mark the exceeding greatness of the
absurdity, and in what this argument issues? Therefore if thou wilt not
any other way, yet by these reasonings be instructed to rid thyself of
this wicked thought, and to flee from vice, and cleave to the toils
which end in virtue: and then shalt thou know certainly that our
concerns are not bounded by the present life. And if any one ask thee,
“Who hath come from thence and brought word what is there?”
say unto him, “of men not one; for surely he would have been
often disbelieved, as vaunting, and exaggerating the thing; but the
Lord of the angels hath brought word with exactness of all those
things. What need then have we of any man, seeing He, that will demand
account of us, crieth aloud every day, that He hath both made ready a
hell, and prepared a kingdom; and affords us clear demonstrations of
these things? For if He were not hereafter to

<pb n="83" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_83.html" id="iii.XIII-Page_83" />

judge, neither would he have exacted any
penalty here.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p75">9. “Well, but as to this very point how can it be
reasonable? that of the wicked some should be punished, others not? I
mean, if God be no respecter of persons, as surely He is not, why can
it be that of one He exacts a penalty, but another He suffers to go
away unpunished? Why, this is again more inexplicable than the
former.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p76">Yet if you are willing to hear what we say with candor,
we will solve this difficulty also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p77">What then is the solution? He neither exacts penalty of
all here, lest thou shouldest despair of the resurrection, and lose all
expectation of the judgment, as though all were to give account here;
nor doth He suffer all to go away unpunished, lest on the other hand
thou shouldest account all to be without His providence; but He both
punishes and abstains from punishing: by those whom He punishes,
signifying that in that world also He will exact a penalty of such as
are unpunished here; and by those whom He doth not punish, working upon
thee to believe that there is some fearful trial after our departure
hence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p78">But if He were altogether indifferent about our former
deeds, He neither would have punished any here, nor have conferred
benefits. But now thou seest Him for thy sake stretching out the
heaven, kindling the sun, founding the earth, pouring forth the sea,
expanding the air, and appointing for the moon her courses, setting
unchangeable laws for the seasons of the years, and all other things
too performing their own courses exactly at a sign from Him. For both
our nature, and that of creatures irrational, of them that creep, that
walk, that fly, that swim, in marshes, in springs, in rivers, in
mountains, in forests, in houses, in the air, in plains; plants also,
and seeds, and trees, both wild and cultivated, both fruitful and
unfruitful; and all things in general, moved by that unwearied Hand,
make provision for our life, affording to us of themselves their
ministry, not for our need only, but also for our feeling of high
station.<note n="559" id="iii.XIII-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p79"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIII-p79.1">φιλοτιμαν</span>
.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p80">Seeing therefore order so great and fair (and yet we
have not mentioned so much as the least portion thereof), darest thou
say, that He who for thy sake hath wrought things so many and great
will overlook thee in the most critical points, and suffer thee when
dead to lie with the asses and swine: and that having honored thee with
so great a gift, that of godliness, whereby He hath even equaled thee
with the angels, He will overlook thee after thy countless labors and
toils?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p81">And how can this be reasonable? Why, these things, if we
be silent “the stones will immediately cry out;”<note n="560" id="iii.XIII-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIII-p82"><scripRef passage="Luke xix. 40" id="iii.XIII-p82.1" parsed="|Luke|19|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.19.40">Luke xix.
40</scripRef>.</p></note>so plain are they, and manifest, and more lucid than the sunbeam
itself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIII-p83">Having then considered all these things, and having
convinced our own soul, that after our departure hence, we shall both
stand at the fearful judgment-seat, and give account of all that we
have done, and shall bear our penalty, and submit to our sentence, if
we continue in our negligences; and shall receive crowns and
unutterable blessings, if we are willing to give a little heed to
ourselves; let us both stop the mouths of them who gainsay these
things, and ourselves choose the way of virtue; that with due
confidence departing to that tribunal, we may attain unto the good
things that are promised us, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion, now and ever, world
without end. Amen.</p>

not casting one’s self into danger, but the failing to stand
manfully when fallen into it. To teach us this accordingly, and to
soothe the envy of the Jews, He retires to Capernaum; at once
fulfilling the prophecy,<note n="562" id="iii.XIV-p5.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p6"><scripRef passage="Matt. 4.14; Isa. 9.1,2" id="iii.XIV-p6.1" parsed="|Matt|4|14|0|0;|Isa|9|1|9|2" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.14 Bible:Isa.9.1-Isa.9.2">Matt. iv. 14, and Is. ix. 1, 2</scripRef>.</p></note>and making haste to catch the teachers of the world: for they, as

about to depart unto the Gentiles, He hath the occasion given Him by
Jews. For so in this instance, by plotting against His forerunner, and
casting him into prison, they thrust out Christ into the Galilee of the
Gentiles. For to show that He neither speaks of the Jewish nation by a
part of it, nor signifies obscurely all the tribes; mark how the
Prophet distinguishes that place, saying “The land of Nephthalim,

errors and ungodliness. Wherefore he also added, “They which sat
in the region and shadow of death, to them light is sprung up.”
For that thou mightest learn that neither the light nor the darkness
which he speaks of are sensible, in discoursing of the light, he called
it not merely light, but “a great light” which elsewhere he
expresses by the word, True:<note n="565" id="iii.XIV-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p10"><scripRef passage="John i. 9" id="iii.XIV-p10.1" parsed="|John|1|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.9">John i.

death.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p11">Then implying that they did not of themselves seek and
find, but that God showed Himself to them from above, he saith to them,
“Light is sprung up;” that is, the light of itself sprang
up and shone forth: it was not that they first ran to the light. For in
truth the condition of men was at the worst before Christ’s
coming. Since they more than “walked in darkness;” they
“sat in darkness;” a kind of sign that they did not even
hope to be delivered. For as persons not even knowing where to put a
step forward, so they sat, overtaken by the darkness, not being able so
much as to stand any more.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p17">And moreover it was necessary that what concerned Him
should be spoken by another first and not by Himself. For if even after

first borne record Himself; what would they not have said? For this
cause, neither did He preach before John, nor did He work miracles,
until John was cast into prison; lest in this way the multitude should
be divided. Therefore also John did no miracle at all; that by this
means also might give over the multitude to Jesus, His miracles drawing
them unto Him.</p>

jealously disposed towards Him, and the people too suspected not Him
but John to be the Christ; what would not the result have been, had
none of these things taken place? For this cause both Matthew
distinctly notes, that “from that time He began to preach;”
and when He began His preaching, He Himself also taught this same
doctrine, which the other used to preach; and no word as yet concerning
Himself doth the doctrine which he preached say. Because it was for the
time a great thing even for this to be received, forasmuch as they had
not as yet the proper opinion about Him. Therefore also at the
beginning He puts nothing severe or grievous, as the other did,
mentioning an axe, and a tree cut down; a fan, and a threshing-floor,
and unquenchable fire; but <i>His</i> preludes are gracious: the
Heavens and the kingdom there are the good tidings which he declares to
His hearers.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p21">3. “And walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two
brethren, Simon that was surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother,

them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they
left their nets, and followed Him.”<note n="570" id="iii.XIV-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 18, 19" id="iii.XIV-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|4|18|4|19" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.18-Matt.4.19">Matt. iv.

in another manner. Whence it is evident that
this was a second call; and from many things one may perceive this. For
there it is said, that they came to Him when “John was not yet
cast into prison;” but here, after he was in confinement. And
there Andrew calls Peter, but here Jesus calls both. And John saith,
Jesus seeing Simon coming, saith, “Thou art Simon, the Son of
Jona, thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a
stone.”<note n="571" id="iii.XIV-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p24"><scripRef passage="John i. 42" id="iii.XIV-p24.1" parsed="|John|1|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.42">John i.
42</scripRef>.</p></note> But Matthew saith that he was already called by that name; for his
words are, “Seeing Simon that was called Peter.” And from
the place whence they were called, and from many other things, one may
perceive this; and from their ready obedience, and abandonment of all.
For now they were well instructed beforehand. Thus, in the other case,
Andrew is seen coming into His house, and hearing many things; but
here, having heard one bare word, they followed immediately. Since
neither was it unnatural<note n="572" id="iii.XIV-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p25">[“it was natural.”—R.]</p></note>for them to follow Him at the beginning, and then leave Him again and
return anew to their own craft, when they saw both John thrown into
prison, and Himself departing. Accordingly you see that He finds them
actually fishing. But He neither forbad them at the first when minded
to withdraw, nor having withdrawn themselves, did He let them go
altogether; but He gave way when they started aside from Him, and comes
again to win them back; which kind of thing is the great point in
fishing.<note n="573" id="iii.XIV-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p26"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIV-p26.1">μγιστο
τρπο λεα</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p27">But mark both their faith, and their obedience. For
though they were in the midst of their work (and ye know how greedy a
thing fishing is), when they heard His command, they delayed not, they
procrastinated not, they said not, “let us return home, and
converse with our kinsfolk,” but “they forsook all and
followed,” even as Elisha did to Elijah.”<note n="574" id="iii.XIV-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Kings xix. 20, 21" id="iii.XIV-p28.1" parsed="|1Kgs|19|20|19|21" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.19.20-1Kgs.19.21">1 Kings
xix. 20, 21</scripRef>.</p></note> Because such is the obedience which Christ seeks of us, as that we
delay not even a moment of time, though something absolutely most
needful should vehemently press on us. Wherefore also when some other
had come unto Him, and was asking leave to bury his own father,<note n="575" id="iii.XIV-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p29"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 21, 22" id="iii.XIV-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|8|21|8|22" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.21-Matt.8.22">Matt. viii.
21, 22</scripRef>.</p></note>not even this did He permit him to do; to signify that before all we
ought to esteem the following of Himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p30">But if thou should say, “the promise is very
great;” even for this do I most admire them, for that when they
had not as yet seen any sign, they believed in so great a reach of
promise, and accounted all but second to that attendance. And this,
because they believed that by what words they were caught, by the same
they would be able to catch others also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p31">To these, then, such was His promise: but to James and
John He saith no such thing. For the obedience of those that had gone
before had by this time paved the way for these. And besides they had
also heard many things before concerning Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p32">And see how he doth with exact care intimate unto us
their poverty also: in that He found them sewing up their nets. So
exceeding great was their poverty, that they were mending what was worn
out, not being able to buy others. And this too was for the time no
small proof of virtue, their beating poverty with ease, their
supporting themselves by honest labor, their being bound one to another
by the power of love, their having their father with them, and
attending upon them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p33">4. When therefore He had caught them, then He begins in
their presence to work miracles, by His deeds confirming the words of
John concerning Him. And He was continually frequenting their
synagogues, even by this instructing them that He was not a sort of
adversary of God and deceiver, but that He was come in accordance with
the Father.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p34">And while frequenting them, He did not preach only, but
also showed forth miracles. And this, because on every occasion,
whensoever anything is done strange and surprising, and any polity is
introduced, God is wont to work miracles as pledges of his power, which
He affords to them that are to receive His laws. Thus, for instance,
when He was about to make man, He created a whole world, and then gave
him that law which he had in Paradise. And when He was to give laws to
Noah, He showed forth anew great miracles, in that He reduced again the
whole creation to its elements,<note n="576" id="iii.XIV-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p35"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIV-p35.1">ἀνεστοιχεου</span>
.</p></note>and made that fearful sea to prevail for a full year; and in that, amid
so great a tempest, He preserved that righteous man. And in the time of
Abraham too He vouchsafed many signs; as his victory in the war, the
plague upon Pharaoh, his deliverance from dangers. And when about to
legislate for the Jews, He showed forth those marvellous and great
prodigies, and then gave the law. Just so in this case also, being to
introduce a certain high polity, and to tell them what they had never
heard, by the display of the miracles He confirms what He saith.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p36">Thus because the kingdom He was preach

<pb n="86" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_86.html" id="iii.XIV-Page_86" />

ing appeared not, by the things that appear, He
makes it, though invisible, manifest.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p37">And mark the evangelist’s care to avoid
superfluity of words;<note n="577" id="iii.XIV-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p38"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIV-p38.1">τ

words speeds over showers of miracles.<note n="578" id="iii.XIV-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p39"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIV-p39.1">νιφδα
σημεων</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p40">For “they brought unto Him,” saith he,
“all that were sick with divers diseases, and torments, and those
which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and
those that had the palsy, and He healed them.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p41">But our inquiry is this; why it can have been that He
demanded faith of none of them? For He said not, what we find Him
saying after this, “Believe ye that I am able to do
this?”<note n="579" id="iii.XIV-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 28" id="iii.XIV-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|9|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.28">Matt. ix.
28</scripRef>.</p></note>because He had not as yet given proof of His power. And besides, the
very act of approaching Him, and of bringing others to Him, exhibited
no common faith. For they brought them even from far; whereas they
would never have brought them, unless they had persuaded themselves of
great things concerning Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p43">Now then, let us too follow Him; for we also have many
diseases of our soul, and these especially He would fain heal. Since
with this intent He corrects that other sort, that He may banish these
out of our soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p44">5. Let us therefore come unto Him, and let us ask
nothing pertaining to this life, but rather remission of sins. For
indeed He gives it even now, if we be in earnest. Since as then
“His fame went out into Syria,” so now into the whole
world. And they indeed ran together on hearing that He healed persons
possessed: and thou, after having much more and greater experience of
His power, dost thou not rouse thyself and run?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p45">But whereas they left both country, and friends, and
kinsfolk; endurest thou not so much as to leave thy house for the sake
of drawing near, and obtaining far greater things? Or rather we do not
require of thee so much as this, but leave thy evil habits only, and
thou canst easily be made whole, remaining at home with thy
friends.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p46">But as it is, if we have any bodily ailment, we do and
contrive everything to be rid of what pains us; but when our soul is
indisposed, we delay, and draw back. For which cause neither from the
other sort are we delivered: since the things that are indispensable
are becoming to us secondary, and the secondary indispensable; and
letting alone the fountain of our ills, we would fain cleanse out the
streams.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p47">For that our bodily ills are caused by the wickedness of
the soul, is shown both by him that had the palsy thirty and eight
years, and by him that was let down through the roof, and by Cain also
before these; and from many other things likewise one may perceive
this. Let us do away then with the well-spring of our evils, and all
the channels of our diseases will be stayed. For the disease is not
palsy only, but also our sin; and this more than that, by how much a
soul is better than a body.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p48">Let us therefore now also draw nigh unto Him; let us
entreat Him that He would brace our paralyzed soul, and leaving all
things that pertain to this life, let us take account of the things
spiritual only. Or if thou cleave unto these also, yet think of them
after the other.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p49">Neither must thou think lightly of it, because thou hast
no pain in sinning; rather on this very account most of all do thou
lament, that thou feelest not the anguish of thine offenses. For not
because sin bites not, doth this come to pass, but because the
offending soul is insensible. Regard with this view them that have a
feeling of their own sins, how they wail more bitterly than such as are
being cut, or burned; how many things they do, how many suffer, how
greatly they mourn and lament, in order to be delivered from their evil
conscience. They would not do any such thing, unless they were
exceedingly pained in soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p50">The best thing then is, to avoid sin in the first
instance: the next to it, is to feel that we sin, and thoroughly amend
ourselves. But if we have not this, how shall we pray to God, and ask
forgiveness of our sins, we who take no account of these matters? For
when thou thyself who hast offended art unwilling to know so much as
this very fact, that thou hast sinned; for what manner of offenses will
thou entreat God for pardon? For what thou knowest not? And how wilt
thou know the greatness of the benefit? Tell therefore thine offenses
in particular, that thou mayest learn for what thou receivest
forgiveness, that so thou mayest become grateful towards thy
Benefactor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p51">But thou, when it is a man whom thou hast provoked,
entreatest friends, neighbors, and door-keepers, and spendest money,
and consumest many days in visiting and petitioning, and though he that
is provoked utterly reject thee once, twice, ten thousand times over,
thou despondest not, but becoming more earnest thou makest the more
entreaty; but when the God of all is provoked, we gape, and throw
ourselves back, and live in luxury and in drunkenness, and do

<pb n="87" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_87.html" id="iii.XIV-Page_87" />

all things as usual. And when shall we be
able to propitiate Him? and how shall we by this very thing fail to
provoke Him so much the more? For not so much sinning, as signing
without even pain, causes in Him indignation and wrath. Wherefore it
were meet after all this to sink into the very earth, and not so much
as to behold this sun, nor to breathe at all, for that having so
placable a Master, we provoke Him first, and then have no remorse for
provoking Him. And yet He assuredly, even when He is wroth, doeth not
so as hating and turning away from us, but in order that in this way at
least He may win us over to Himself. For if He continued after insult
befriending thee, thou wouldest the more despise Him. Therefore in
order that this may not be, He turns away for a little while, to have
thee ever with Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p52">6. Let us now, I pray you, take courage at His love to
man, and let us show forth an anxious repentance, before the day come
on, which permits us not to profit thereby. For as yet all depends on
us, but then He that judges hath alone control over the sentence.
“Let us therefore come before His face with
confession;”<note n="580" id="iii.XIV-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIV-p53"><scripRef passage="Ps. xcv. 2" id="iii.XIV-p53.1" parsed="|Ps|95|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.95.2">Ps. xcv.
2</scripRef>, LXX.</p></note>let us bewail, let us mourn. For if we should be able to prevail upon
the Judge before the appointed day to forgive us our sins, then we need
not so much as enter into the court; as on the other hand, if this be
not done, He will hear us publicly in the presence of the world, and we
shall no longer have any hope of pardon. For no one of those who have
not done away with their sins here, when he hath departed thither shall
be able to escape his account for them; but as they who are taken out
of these earthly prisons are brought in their chains to the place of
judgment, even so all souls, when they have gone away hence bound with
the manifold chains of their sins, are led to the awful judgment-seat.
For in truth our present life is nothing better than a prison. But as
when we have entered into that apartment, we see all bound with chains;
so now if we withdraw ourselves from outward show, and enter into each
man’s life, into each man’s soul, we shall see it bound
with chains more grievous than iron: and this most especially if thou
enter into the souls of them that are rich. For the more men have about
them, so much the more are they bound. As therefore with regard to the
prisoner, when thou seest him with irons on his back, on his hands, and
often on his feet too, thou dost therefore most of all account him
miserable; so also as to the rich man, when thou seest him encompassed
with innumerable affairs, let him not be therefore rich, but rather for
these very things wretched, in thine account. For together with these
bonds, he hath a cruel jailor too, the wicked love of riches; which
suffers him not to pass out of this prison, but provides for him
thousands of fetters, and guards, and doors, and bolts; and when he
hath cast him into the inner prison, persuades him even to feel
pleasure in these bonds; that he may not find so much as any hope of
deliverance from the evils which press on him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p54">And if in thought thou wert to lay open that man’s
soul, thou wouldest see it not bound only, but squalid, and filthy, and
teeming with vermin. For no better than vermin are the pleasures of
luxury, but even more abominable, and destroy the body more, together
with the soul also; and upon the one and upon the other they bring ten
thousand scourges of sickness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIV-p55">On account then of all these things let us entreat the
Redeemer of our souls, that He would both burst asunder our bands, and
remove this our cruel jailor, and having set us free from the burden of
those iron chains, He would make our spirits lighter than any wing. And
as we entreat Him, so let us contribute our own part, earnestness, and
consideration, and an excellent zeal. For thus we shall be able both in
a short time to be freed from the evils which now oppress us, and to
learn in what condition we were before, and to lay hold on the liberty
which belongs to us; unto which God grant we may all attain, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
and power forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.XV-p3">“And Jesus seeing the multitudes went up into the
mountain, and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him. And He
opened His mouth, and taught them saying, Blessed,” etc.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XV-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XV-p4.1">See</span> how unambitious He was, and
void of boasting: in that He did not lead people about with Him, but
whereas, when healing was required, He had Himself gone about
everywhere, visiting both towns and country places; now when the
multitude is become very great, He sits in one spot: and that not in
the midst of any city or forum, but on a mountain and in a wilderness;
instructing us to do nothing for display, and to separate ourselves
from the tumults of ordinary life,<note n="581" id="iii.XV-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p5"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p5.1">τν ν μσ
θορβων</span>.</p></note>and this most especially, when we are to study wisdom, and to discourse
of things needful to be done.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p6">But when He had gone up into the mount, and “was
set down, His disciples came unto Him.” Seest thou their growth
in virtue? and how in a moment<note n="582" id="iii.XV-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p7">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p7.1">ἀθρον</span>, “all at
once.”—R.]</p></note>they became better men? Since the multitude were but gazers on the
miracles, but these from that hour desired also to hear some great and
high thing. And indeed this it was set Him on His teaching, and made
Him begin this discourse.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p8">For it was not men’s bodies only that He was
healing, but He was also amending their souls; and again from the care
of these He would pass to attendance on the other. Thus He at once
varied the succor that He gave, and likewise mingled with the
instruction afforded by His words, the manifestation of His glory from
His works; and besides, He stopped the shameless mouths of the
heretics, signifying by this His care of both parts of our being, that
He Himself is the Maker of the whole creation. Therefore also on each
nature He bestowed abundant providence, now amending the one, now the
other.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p9">And in this way He was then employed. For it is said,
that “He opened His mouth, and taught them.” And wherefore
is the clause added, “He opened His mouth”? To inform thee
that in His very silence He gave instruction, and not when He spoke
only: but at one time by “opening His mouth,” at another
uttering His voice by the works which He did.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p10">But when thou hearest that He taught them, do not think
of Him as discoursing with His disciples only, but rather with all
through them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p11">For since the multitude was such as a multitude ever
is,<note n="583" id="iii.XV-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p12"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p12.1">δημδε</span>.</p></note>and consisted moreover of such as creep on the ground,<note n="584" id="iii.XV-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p13"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p13.1">χμαι

them: in His conversation with them providing that the rest also, who
were yet very far from the level of His sayings, might find His lesson
of self-denial no longer grievous unto them. Of which indeed both Luke
gave intimation, when he said, that He directed His words unto them:<note n="585" id="iii.XV-p13.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p14"><scripRef passage="Luke vi. 20" id="iii.XV-p14.1" parsed="|Luke|6|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.20">Luke vi.

His eyes on His disciples, and said.” And <scripRef passage="Luke 6.27" id="iii.XV-p14.2" parsed="|Luke|6|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.27">ver. 27</scripRef>, “I say unto you which
hear.”</p></note>and Matthew too, clearly declaring the same, wrote, “His
disciples came unto Him, and He taught them.” For thus the others
also were sure to be more eagerly attentive to Him, than they would
have been, had He addressed Himself unto all.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p15">2. Whence then doth He begin? and what kind of
foundations of His new polity doth He lay for us?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p16">Let us hearken with strict attention unto what is said.
For though it was spoken unto them, it was written for the sake also of
all men afterwards. And accordingly on this account, though He had His
disciples in His mind in His public preaching, yet unto them He limits
not His sayings, but applies all His words of blessing without
restriction. Thus He said not, “Blessed are ye, if ye become
poor,” but “Blessed are the poor.” And I may add that
even if He had spoken of them, the advice would still be common to all.
For so, when He saith, “Lo! I am with you always, even unto the
end of the world,”<note n="586" id="iii.XV-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p17"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxviii. 20" id="iii.XV-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|28|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.28.20">Matt.
xxviii. 20</scripRef>.</p></note> He is discoursing not with them only, but also, through them, with all
the world. And in pronouncing them blessed, who are persecuted, and
chased, and suffer

<pb n="89" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_89.html" id="iii.XV-Page_89" />

all intolerable
things; not for them only, but also for all who arrive at the same
excellency, He weaves His crown.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p18">However, that this may be yet plainer, and to inform
thee that thou hast great interest in His sayings, and so indeed hath
all mankind, if any choose to give heed; hear how He begins these
wondrous words.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p19">“Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the
kingdom of Heaven.”<note n="587" id="iii.XV-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 3" id="iii.XV-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|5|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.3">Matt. v.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p21">What is meant by “the poor in spirit?” The
humble and contrite in mind. For by “spirit” He hath here
designated the soul, and the faculty of choice. That is, since many are
humble not willingly, but compelled by stress of circumstances; letting
these pass (for this were no matter of praise), He blesses them first,
who by choice humble and contract themselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p22">But why said he not, “the humble,” but
rather “the poor?” Because this is more than that. For He
means here them who are awestruck, and tremble at the commandments of
God. Whom also by His prophet Isaiah God earnestly accepting said,
“To whom will I look, but to him who is meek<note n="588" id="iii.XV-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p23"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p23.1">ταπεινν</span>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XV-p23.2">LXX</span>.</p></note>and quiet, and trembleth at My words?”<note n="589" id="iii.XV-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p24"><scripRef passage="Isa. lxvi. 2" id="iii.XV-p24.1" parsed="|Isa|66|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.66.2">Isa. lxvi.
2</scripRef>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XV-p24.2">LXX</span>.</p></note> For indeed there are many kinds of humility: one is humble in his own
measure, another with all excess of lowliness. It is this last
lowliness of mind which that blessed prophet commends, picturing to us
the temper that is not merely subdued, but utterly broken, when he

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p27">3. For whereas the greatest of evils, and those which
make havoc of the whole world, had their entering in from
pride:—for both the devil, not being such before, did thus become
a devil; as indeed Paul plainly declared, saying, “Lest being
lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the
devil:”<note n="592" id="iii.XV-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. iii. 6" id="iii.XV-p28.1" parsed="|1Tim|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.3.6">1 Tim. iii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>—and the first man, too, puffed up by the devil with these hopes,
was made an example of,<note n="593" id="iii.XV-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p29"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p29.1">ἐξετραχηλσθη</span>.</p></note>and became mortal (for expecting to become a god, he lost even what he
had; and God also upbraiding him with this, and mocking his folly,
said, “Behold, Adam is become as one of us”<note n="594" id="iii.XV-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p30"><scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 22" id="iii.XV-p30.1" parsed="|Gen|3|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.22">Gen. iii.
22</scripRef>.</p></note>; and each one of those that came after did hereby wreck himself in
impiety, fancying some equality with God:—since, I say, this was
the stronghold of our evils, and the root and fountain of all
wickedness, He, preparing a remedy suitable to the disease, laid this
law first as a strong and safe foundation. For this being fixed as a
base, the builder in security lays on it all the rest. But if this be
taken away, though a man reach to the Heavens in his course of life,<note n="595" id="iii.XV-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p31"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p31.1">πολιτευμενο</span>.</p></note>it is all easily undermined, and issues in a grievous end. Though
fasting, prayer, almsgiving, temperance, any other good thing whatever,
be gathered together in thee; without humility all fall away and
perish.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p32">It was this very thing that took place in the instance
of the Pharisee. For even after he had arrived at the very summit, he
“went down”<note n="596" id="iii.XV-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p33"><scripRef passage="Luke xviii. 14" id="iii.XV-p33.1" parsed="|Luke|18|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.14">Luke xviii.
14</scripRef>.</p></note>with the loss of all, because he had not the mother of virtues: for as
pride is the fountain of all wickedness, so is humility the principle
of all self-command. Wherefore also He begins with this, pulling up
boasting by the very root out of the soul of His hearers.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p34">“And what,” one may ask, “is this to
His disciples, who were on every account humble? For in truth they had
nothing to be proud of, being fishermen, poor, ignoble, and
illiterate.” Even though these things concerned not His
disciples, yet surely they concerned such as were then present, and
such as were hereafter to receive the disciples, lest they should on
this account despise them. But it were truer to say that they did also
concern His disciples. For even if not then, yet by and by they were
sure to require this help, after their signs and wonders, and their
honor from the world, and their confidence towards God. For neither
wealth, nor power, nor royalty itself, had so much power to exalt men,
as the things which they possessed in all fullness. And besides, it was
natural that even before the signs they might be lifted up, at that
very time when they saw the multitude, and all that audience
surrounding their Master; they might feel some human weakness.
Wherefore He at once represses their pride.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p35">And He doth not introduce what He saith by way of advice
or of commandments, but by way of blessing, so making His word less
burthensome, and opening to all the course of His discipline. For He
said not, “This or that person,” but “they who do so,
are all of them <i>blessed</i>.” So that though thou be a slave,
a beggar, in poverty, a stranger, unlearned,<note n="597" id="iii.XV-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p36">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p36.1">ἰδιτη</span>.]</p></note>there is nothing to hinder thee from being blessed, if thou emulate
this virtue.</p>

<pb n="90" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_90.html" id="iii.XV-Page_90" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p37">4. Now having begun, as you see, where most need was, He
proceeds to another commandment, one which seems to be opposed to the
judgment of the whole world. For whereas all think that they who
rejoice are enviable, those in dejection, poverty, and mourning,
wretched, He calls these blessed rather than those; saying thus,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p38">“Blessed are they that mourn.”<note n="598" id="iii.XV-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 4" id="iii.XV-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.4">Matt. v.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p40">Yet surely all men call them miserable. For therefore He
wrought the miracles beforehand, that in such enactments as these He
might be entitled to credit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p41">And here too again he designated not simply all that
mourn, but all that do so for sins: since surely that other kind of
mourning is forbidden, and that earnestly, which relates to anything of
this life. This Paul also clearly declared, when he said, “The
sorrow of the world worketh death, but godly sorrow worketh repentance
unto salvation, not to be repented of.”<note n="599" id="iii.XV-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p42"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 10" id="iii.XV-p42.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.10">2 Cor. vii.
10</scripRef>. [R.V., “<i>a
repentance</i> which bringeth no regret,” in the margin,
“unto a salvation which bringeth no regret.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p43">These then He too Himself calls blessed, whose sorrow is
of that kind; yet not simply them that sorrow did He designate, but
them that sorrow intensely. Therefore He did not say, “they that
sorrow,” but “they that mourn.” For this commandment
again is fitted to teach us entire self-control. For if those who
grieve for children, or wife, or any other relation gone from them,
have no fondness for gain or pleasure during that period of their
sorrow; if they aim not at glory, are not provoked by insults, nor led
captive by envy, nor beset by any other passion, their grief alone
wholly possessing them; much more will they who mourn for their own
sins, as they ought to mourn, show forth a self-denial greater than
this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p44">Next, what is the reward for these? “For they
shall be comforted,” saith He.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p45">Where shall they be comforted! tell me. Both here and
there. For since the thing enjoined was exceeding burthensome and
galling, He promised to give that, which most of all made it light.
Wherefore, if thou wilt be comforted, mourn: and think not this a dark
saying. For when God doth comfort, though sorrows come upon thee by
thousands like snow-flakes, thou wilt be above them all. Since in
truth, as the returns which God gives are always far greater than our
labors; so He hath wrought in this case, declaring them that mourn to
be blessed, not after the value of what they do, but after His own love
towards man. For they that mourn, mourn for misdoings, and to such it
is enough to enjoy forgiveness, and obtain wherewith to answer for
themselves. But forasmuch as He is full of love towards man, He doth
not limit His recompense either to the removal of our punishments, or
to the deliverance from our sins, but He makes them even blessed, and
imparts to them abundant consolation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p46">But He bids us mourn, not only for our own, but also for
other men’s misdoings. And of this temper were the souls of the
saints: such was that of Moses, of Paul, of David; yea, all these many
times mourned for evils not their own.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p47">5. “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit
the earth.”<note n="600" id="iii.XV-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p48">Or, “the land.”</p></note> Tell me, what kind of earth? Some<note n="601" id="iii.XV-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p49">So St. Aug. <i>de Serm. Dom. in Monte</i>, lib. i.

we find any mention of an earth that is merely figurative.<note n="602" id="iii.XV-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p50.1">νοητν</span>.</p></note> But what can the saying mean? He holds out a sensible prize; even as
Paul also doth, in that when he had said, “Honor thy father and
thy mother,”<note n="603" id="iii.XV-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p51"><scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 2" id="iii.XV-p51.1" parsed="|Eph|6|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.2">Eph. vi.

He Himself unto the thief again, “Today shalt thou be with me in
Paradise.”<note n="604" id="iii.XV-p51.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p52"><scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 43" id="iii.XV-p52.1" parsed="|Luke|23|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.43">Luke xxiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p53">Thus He doth not incite us by means of the future
blessings only, but of the present also, for the sake of the grosser
sort of His hearers, and such as before the future seek those
others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p54">Thus, for example, further on also He said, “Agree
with thine adversary.”<note n="605" id="iii.XV-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p55"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 25" id="iii.XV-p55.1" parsed="|Matt|5|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.25">Matt. v.

“Lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and
the judge to the officer.”<note n="606" id="iii.XV-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p56"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 25" id="iii.XV-p56.1" parsed="|Matt|5|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.25">Matt. v.

happens before our eyes. And again, “Whosoever shall say to his
brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council.”<note n="607" id="iii.XV-p56.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p57"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 22" id="iii.XV-p57.1" parsed="|Matt|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.22">Matt. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p58">And Paul too sets forth sensible rewards at great
length, and uses things present in his exhortations; as when he is
discoursing about virginity. For having said nothing about the heavens
there, for the time he urges it by things present, saying,
“Because of the present distress,” and, “But I spare
you,” and, “I would have you without
carefulness.”<note n="608" id="iii.XV-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p59"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 26, 28, 32" id="iii.XV-p59.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|26|0|0;|1Cor|7|28|0|0;|1Cor|7|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.26 Bible:1Cor.7.28 Bible:1Cor.7.32">1 Cor. vii.
26, 28, 32</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p60">Thus accordingly Christ also with the things spiritual
hath mingled the sensible. For whereas the meek man is thought to lose
all his own, He promises the contrary, saying,

<pb n="91" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_91.html" id="iii.XV-Page_91" />

“Nay, but this is he who possesses his
goods in safety, namely, he who is not rash, nor boastful: while that
sort of man shall often lose his patrimony, and his very
life.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p61">And besides, since in the Old Testament the prophet used
to say continually, “The meek shall inherit the
earth;”<note n="609" id="iii.XV-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p62"><scripRef passage="Ps. xxxvii. 11" id="iii.XV-p62.1" parsed="|Ps|37|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.37.11">Ps. xxxvii.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> He thus weaves into His discourse the words to which they were
accustomed, so as not everywhere to speak a strange language.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p63">And this He saith, not as limiting the rewards to things
present, but as joining with these the other sort of gifts also. For
neither in speaking of any spiritual thing doth He exclude such as are
in the present life; nor again in promising such as are in our life,
doth He limit his promise to that kind. For He saith, “Seek ye
the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto
you.”<note n="610" id="iii.XV-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p64"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 33" id="iii.XV-p64.1" parsed="|Matt|6|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.33">Matt. vi.

after righteousness.”<note n="612" id="iii.XV-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p67"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 6" id="iii.XV-p67.1" parsed="|Matt|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.6">Matt. v.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p68">What sort of righteousness? He means either the whole of
virtue, or that particular virtue which is opposed to
covetousness.<note n="613" id="iii.XV-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p69">See Aristot. <i>Eth. Nic</i>. v. 2.</p></note> For since He is about to give commandment concerning mercy, to show how
we must show mercy, as, for instance, not of rapine or covetousness, He
blesses them that lay hold of righteousness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p70">And see with what exceeding force He puts it. For He
said not, “Blessed are they which keep fast by
righteousness,” but, “Blessed are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness:” that not merely anyhow, but with all
desire we may pursue it. For since this is the most peculiar property
of covetousness, and we are not so enamored of meat and drink, as of
gaining, and compassing ourselves with more and more, He bade us to
transfer this desire to a new object, freedom from covetousness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p71">Then He appoints the prize, again from things sensible;
saying, “for they shall be filled.” Thus, because it is
thought that the rich are commonly made such by covetousness,
“Nay,” saith He, “it is just contrary: for it is
righteousness that doeth this. Wherefore, so long as thou doest
righteously, fear not poverty, nor tremble at hunger. For the
extortioners, they are the very persons who lose all, even as he
certainly who is in love with righteousness, possesses himself the
goods of all men in safety.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p72">But if they who covet not other men’s goods enjoy
so great abundance,<note n="614" id="iii.XV-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p73">Not that St. Chrysostom limited this or any of the
Gospel promises to a temporal sense. See below, sec. 7.</p></note>much more they who give up their own.</p>

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p76">Here He seems to me to speak not of those only who show
mercy in giving of money, but those likewise who are merciful in their
actions. For the way of showing mercy is manifold, and this commandment
is broad. What then is the reward thereof? “For they shall obtain
mercy.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p77">And it seems indeed to be a sort of equal recompence,
but it is a far greater thing than the act of goodness. For whereas
they themselves show mercy as men, they obtain mercy from the God of
all; and it is not the same thing, man’s mercy, and God’s;
but as wide as is the interval between wickedness and goodness, so far
is the one of these removed from the other.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p78">“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.”<note n="616" id="iii.XV-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p79"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 8" id="iii.XV-p79.1" parsed="|Matt|5|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.8">Matt. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p80">Behold again the reward is spiritual. Now He here calls
“pure,” either those who have attained unto all virtue, and
are not conscious to themselves of any evil; or those who live in
temperance. For there is nothing which we need so much in order to see
God, as this last virtue. Wherefore Paul also said, “Follow peace
with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord.”<note n="617" id="iii.XV-p80.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p81"><scripRef passage="Heb. xii. 14" id="iii.XV-p81.1" parsed="|Heb|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.14">Heb. xii.

have.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p82">For because there are many who show mercy, and who
commit no rapine, nor are covetous, who yet are guilty of fornication
and uncleanness; to signify that the former alone suffices not, He hath
added this, much in the same sense as Paul, writing to the Corinthians,
bore witness of the Macedonians, that they were rich not only in
almsgiving, but also in all other virtue. For having spoken of the
noble spirit<note n="618" id="iii.XV-p82.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p83">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p83.1">φιλοτιμα</span>. The term

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p87">Here He not only takes away altogether our own strife

more, namely, that we should set at one again others, who are at

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p98">As if He said, “Though they should call you
sorcerers, deceivers, pestilent persons, or whatever else, blessed are
ye:” so He speaks. What could be newer than these injunctions?
wherein the very things which all others avoid, these He declares to be
desirable; I mean, being poor, mourning, persecution, evil report. But
yet He both affirmed this, and convinced not two, nor ten, nor twenty,
nor an hundred, nor a thousand men, but the whole world. And hearing
things so grievous and galling, so contrary to the accustomed ways of
men, the multitudes “were astonished.” So great was the
power of Him who spake.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p99">However, lest thou shouldest think that the mere fact of
being evil spoken of makes men blessed, He hath set two limitations;
when it is for His sake, and when the things that are said are false:
for without these, he who is evil spoken of, so far from being blessed,
is miserable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p100">Then see the prize again: “Because your reward is
great in heaven.” But thou, though thou hear not of a kingdom
given in each one of the blessings, be not discouraged. For although He
give different names to the rewards, yet He brings all into His
kingdom. Thus, both when He saith, “they that mourn shall be
comforted;” and, “they that show mercy shall obtain
mercy;” and, “the pure in heart shall see God;” and,
the peacemakers “shall be called the children of God;”
nothing else but the Kingdom doth He shadow out by all these sayings.
For such as enjoy these, shall surely attain unto that. Think not
therefore that this reward is for the poor in spirit only, but for
those also who hunger after righteousness, for the meek, and for all
the rest without exception.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p101">Since on this account He hath set His blessing on them
all, that thou mightest not look for anything sensible: for that man
cannot be blessed, who is crowned with such things as come to an end
with this present life, and hurry by quicker than a shadow.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p102">8. But when He had said, “your reward is
great,” he added also another consolation, saying, “For so
persecuted they the prophets which were before you.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p103">Thus, since that first, the promise of the Kingdom, was
yet to come, and all in expectation, He affords them comfort from this
world; from their fellowship with those who before them had been
ill-treated.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p104">For “think not,” saith He, “that for
something inconsistent in your sayings and enactments ye suffer these
things: or, as being teachers of evil doctrines, ye are to be
persecuted by them; the plots and dangers proceed not of any wickedness
in your sayings, but of the malice of those who hear you. Wherefore
neither are they any blame to you who suffer wrong, but to them who do
the wrong. And to the truth of these things all preceding time bears
witness. For against the prophets they did not even bring any charge of
transgressing the law, and of sentiments of impiety, that they stoned
some, chased away others, encompassed others with innumerable
afflictions. Wherefore let not this trouble you, for of the very same
mind they do all that is done now.” Seest thou how He raised up
their spirits, by placing them near to the company of Moses and
Elias?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p105">Thus also Paul writing to the Thessalonians, saith,
“For ye became followers of the Churches of God, which are in
Judea; for ye also have suffered the same things of your own
fellow-countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: who both killed the
Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have driven us out; and they
please not God, and are contrary to all men.”<note n="624" id="iii.XV-p105.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p106"><scripRef passage="1 Thess. ii. 14, 15" id="iii.XV-p106.1" parsed="|1Thess|2|14|2|15" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.2.14-1Thess.2.15">1 Thess.
ii. 14, 15</scripRef>.</p></note> Which same point here also Christ hath established.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p107">And whereas in the other beatitudes, He said,
“Blessed are the poor,” and “the merciful;”
here He hath not put it generally, but addresses His speech unto
themselves, saying, “Blessed are ye, when they shall revile you,
and persecute you, and say every evil word:” signifying that this
is an especial privilege of theirs; and that beyond all others,
teachers have this for their own.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p108">At the same time He here also covertly signifies His own
dignity, and His equality in honor with Him who begat Him. For
“as they on the Father’s account,” saith He,
“so shall ye also for me suffer these things.” But when He
saith, “the prophets which

<pb n="93" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_93.html" id="iii.XV-Page_93" />

were before you,” He implies that they were also by
this time become prophets.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p109">Next, declaring that this above all profits them, and
makes them glorious, He did not say, “they will calumniate and
persecute you, but I will prevent it.” For not in their escaping
evil report, but in their noble endurance thereof, and in refuting them
by their actions, He will have their safety stand: this being a much
greater thing than the other; even as to be struck and not hurt, is
much greater than escaping the blow.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p110">9. Now in this place He saith, “Your reward is
great in heaven.” But Luke<note n="625" id="iii.XV-p110.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p111">See <scripRef passage="Luke vi. 23, 26" id="iii.XV-p111.1" parsed="|Luke|6|23|0|0;|Luke|6|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.23 Bible:Luke.6.26">Luke
vi. 23, 26</scripRef>.</p></note>reports Him to have spoken this, both earnestly, and with more entire
consolation; for He not only, as you know, pronounces them blessed, who
are evil spoken of for God’s sake, but declares them likewise
wretched, who are well spoken of by all men. For, “Woe unto
you,” saith He, “when all men shall speak well of
you.” And yet the apostles were well spoken of, but not by all
men. Wherefore He said not, “Woe unto you, when men shall speak
well of you,” but, “when all men” shall do so: for it
is not even possible that those who live in the practice of virtue
should be well spoken of by all men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p112">And again He saith, “When they shall cast out your
name as evil, rejoice ye, and leap for joy.”<note n="626" id="iii.XV-p112.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p113"><scripRef passage="Luke vi. 22, 23" id="iii.XV-p113.1" parsed="|Luke|6|22|6|23" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.22-Luke.6.23">Luke vi.
22, 23</scripRef>.</p></note> For not only of the dangers they underwent, but of the calumny also, He
appoints the recompence to be great. Wherefore He said not, “When
they shall persecute, and kill you,” but, “When they shall
revile you, and say all manner of evil.” For most assuredly,
men’s evil reports have a sharper bite than their very deeds. For
whereas, in our dangers, there are many things that lighten the toil,
as to be cheered<note n="627" id="iii.XV-p113.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p114"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p114.1">ἀλεφεσθκι</span>.</p></note>by all, to have many to applaud, to crown, to proclaim our praise; here
in our reproach even this consolation is destroyed. Because we seem not
to have achieved anything great; and this galls the combatant more than
all his dangers: at least many have gone on even to hang themselves,
not bearing evil report. And why marvellest thou at the others? since
that traitor, that shameless and accursed one, he who had ceased to
blush for anything whatever, was wrought upon by this chiefly to hurry
to the halter. And Job again, all adamant as he was, and firmer than a
rock; when he had been robbed of all his possessions, and was suffering
those incurable ills, and had become on a sudden childless, and when he
saw his body pouring out worms like a fountain, and his wife attacking
him, he repelled it all with ease; but when he saw his friends
reproaching and trampling upon him, and entertaining an evil opinion of
him, and saying that he suffered those things for some sins, and was
paying the penalty of wickedness: then was there trouble, then
commotion, even in that great and noble-hearted man.<note n="628" id="iii.XV-p114.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p115">[Literally, “then was disturbed, then was
troubled, that noble and great man.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p116">And David also, letting pass all that he had suffered,
sought of God a retribution for the calumny alone. For, “Let him
curse,” saith he, “for the Lord hath bidden him: that the
Lord may see my humiliation, and requite me for this cursing of his on
this day.”<note n="629" id="iii.XV-p116.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p117"><scripRef passage="2 Sam. xvi. 11, 12" id="iii.XV-p117.1" parsed="|2Sam|16|11|16|12" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.16.11-2Sam.16.12">2 Sam. xvi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p118">And Paul too proclaims the triumph not of those only who
incur danger, or are deprived of their goods, but of these also, thus
saying, “Call to remembrance the former days, in which after ye
were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly whilst
ye were made a gazing stock by reproaches, and afflictions.”<note n="630" id="iii.XV-p118.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p119"><scripRef passage="Heb. x. 32, 33" id="iii.XV-p119.1" parsed="|Heb|10|32|10|33" osisRef="Bible:Heb.10.32-Heb.10.33">Heb. x. 32,
33</scripRef>. [R.V., “in which,
after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;
partly, being made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and
afflictions.” The text of the Homily omits
“both.”—R.]</p></note> On this account then Christ hath appointed the reward also to be
great.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p120">After this, lest any one should say, “Here thou
givest no redress, nor stoppest men’s mouths; and dost thou
assign a reward there?” He hath put before us the prophets, to
show that neither in their case did God give redress. And if, where the
rewards were at hand, He cheered them with things to come; much more
now, when this hope is become clearer, and self-denial is
increased.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p121">And observe too, after how many commandments He hath put
this, for surely He did it not without reason, but to show that it is
not possible for one unprovided, and unarmed with all those other
virtues, to go forth unto these conflicts. Therefore, you see, in each
instance, by the former precept making way for the following one, He
hath woven a sort of golden chain for us. Thus, first, he that is
“humble,” will surely also “mourn” for his own
sins: he that so “mourns,” will be both “meek,”
and “righteous,” and “merciful;” he that is
“merciful,” and “righteous,” and
“contrite” will of course be also “pure in
heart:” and such a one will be “a peacemaker” too:
and he that hath attained unto all these, will be moreover arrayed
against dangers, and will not be troubled when evil is spoken of him,
and he is enduring grievous trials innumerable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p122">10. Now then, after giving them due exhortation, He
refreshes them again with

<pb n="94" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_94.html" id="iii.XV-Page_94" />

praises.
As thus: the injunctions being high, and far surpassing those in the
Old Testament; lest they should be disturbed and confounded, and say,
“How shall we be able to achieve these things?” hear what
He saith: “Ye are the salt of the earth.”<note n="631" id="iii.XV-p122.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p123"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 13" id="iii.XV-p123.1" parsed="|Matt|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.13">Matt. v.
13</scripRef>.</p></note> Implying, that of absolute necessity He enjoins all this. For
“not for your own life apart,” saith He, “but for the
whole world, shall your account be. For not to two cities, nor to ten
or twenty, nor to a single nation am I sending you, as I sent the
prophets; but to earth, and sea, and the whole world; and that in evil
case.” For by saying, “Ye are the salt of the earth,”
He signified all human nature to have “lost its savor,”<note n="632" id="iii.XV-p123.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p124"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p124.1">μωραι</span>?e<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p124.2">ῖσαν</span>.</p></note>and to be decayed by our sins. For which cause, you see, He requires of
them such virtues, as are most necessary and useful for the
superintendence of the common sort. For first, the meek, and yielding,
and merciful, and righteous, shuts not up his good deeds unto himself
only, but also provides that these good fountains should run over for
the benefit of others. And he again who is pure in heart, and a
peacemaker, and is persecuted for the truth’s sake; he again
orders his way of life for the common good. “Think not
then,” He saith, “that ye are drawn on to ordinary
conflicts, or that for some small matters you are to give
account.” “Ye are the salt of the earth.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p125">What then? did they restore the decayed? By no means;
for neither is it possible to do any good to that which is already
spoilt, by sprinkling it with salt. This therefore they did not. But
rather, what things had been before restored, and committed to their
charge, and freed from that ill savor, these they then salted,
maintaining and preserving them in that freshness,<note n="633" id="iii.XV-p125.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p126"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p126.1">νεαρτητι</span>.</p></note>which they had received of the Lord. For that men should be set free
from the rottenness of their sins was the good work of Christ; but
their not returning to it again any more was the object of these
men’s diligence and travail.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p127">Seest thou how by degrees He indicates their superiority
to the very prophets? in that He saith they are teachers, not of
Palestine, but of the whole world; and not simply teachers, but awful
ones too. For this is the marvellous thing, that not by flattering, nor
soothing, but by sharply bracing<note n="634" id="iii.XV-p127.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p128">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p128.1">ἐπιστφοντε</span>,
used of astringents.—R.]</p></note>them, as salt, even so they became dear to all men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p129">“Now marvel not,” saith He, “if
leaving all others, I discourse to you, and draw you on to so great
dangers. For consider over how many cities, tribes, and nations, I am
to send you to preside. Wherefore I would have you not only be prudent
yourselves, but that you should also make others the same. And such
persons have great need to be intelligent, in whom the salvation of the
rest is at stake: they ought so much to abound in virtue, as to impart
of the profit to others also. For if ye do not become such as this, ye
will not suffice even for your own selves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p130">“Be not then impatient, as though my sayings were
too burdensome. For while it is possible for others who have lost their
savor to return by your means, you, if you should come to this, will
with yourselves destroy others also. So that in proportion as the
matters are great, which ye have put into your hands, you need so much
the greater diligence.” Therefore He saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p131">“But if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith
shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast
out, and to be trodden under foot of men.”<note n="635" id="iii.XV-p131.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p132"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 13" id="iii.XV-p132.1" parsed="|Matt|5|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.13">Matt. v.
13</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p133">For other men, though they fall never so often, may
possibly obtain indulgence: but the teacher, should this happen to him,
is deprived of all excuse, and will suffer the most extreme vengeance.
Thus, lest at the words, “When they shall revile you, and
persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you,” they
should be too timid to go forth: He tells them, “unless ye are
prepared to combat with all this, ye have been chosen in vain.”
For it is not evil report that ye should fear, but lest ye should prove
partners in dissimulation.<note n="636" id="iii.XV-p133.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p134"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p134.1">συνυποκρινομνου</span>,

foot:” but if ye continue sharply to brace them up, and then are
evil spoken of, rejoice; for this is the very use of salt, to sting the
corrupt,<note n="637" id="iii.XV-p134.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p135"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p135.1">χανου</span>.</p></note>and make them smart. And so their censure follows of course, in no way
harming you, but rather testifying your firmness. But if through fear
of it you give up the earnestness that becomes you, ye will have to
suffer much more grievously, being both evil spoken of, and despised by
all. For this is the meaning of “trodden under foot.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p136">11. After this He leads on to another, a higher
image.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p137">“Ye are the light of the world.”<note n="638" id="iii.XV-p137.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p138"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 14" id="iii.XV-p138.1" parsed="|Matt|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.14">Matt. v.

mind, far better than this sunbeam: like as they were also a spiritual
<i>salt</i>. And before they are <i>salt</i>, and now <i>light;</i> to
teach thee how great

is the gain
of these strict<note n="640" id="iii.XV-p140.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p141"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p141.1">κατεστυμμνων</span>
.</p></note>precepts, and the profit of that grave discipline: how it binds, and
permits not to become dissolute; and causes clear sight, leading men on
to virtue.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p142">“A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid,
neither do men light a candle, and put it under the bushel.”<note n="641" id="iii.XV-p142.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p143"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 14, 15" id="iii.XV-p143.1" parsed="|Matt|5|14|5|15" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.14-Matt.5.15">Matt. v.
14, 15</scripRef>. [R.V.,
“lamp.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p144">Again, by these words He trains them to strictness of
life, teaching them to be earnest in their endeavors, as set before the
eyes of all men, and contending in the midst of the amphitheatre of the
world. For, “look not to this,” He saith, “that we
are now sitting here, that we are in a small portion of one corner. For
ye shall be as conspicuous to all as a city set on the ridge of a hill,
as a candle in a house on the candlestick, giving light.”<note n="642" id="iii.XV-p144.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p145">[“as a lamp in a house, giving light (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p145.1">φαυων</span>) on the
lampstand.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p146">Where now are they who persevere in disbelieving the
power of Christ? Let them hear these things, and let them adore His
might, amazed at the power of the prophecy. For consider how great
things he promised to them, who were not known even in their own
country: that earth and sea should know them, and that they should by
their fame reach to the limits of the inhabited world; or rather, not
by their fame, but by the working of the good they wrought. For it was
not fame that bearing them everywhere made them conspicuous, but also
the actual demonstration by their works. Since, as though they had
wings, more vehemently than the sunbeam did they overrun the whole
earth, sowing the light of godliness.<note n="643" id="iii.XV-p146.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p147"><i>Lumine conserit arva, Lucr</i>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p148">But here He seems to me to be also training them to
boldness of speech. For to say, “A city set on a hill cannot be
hid,” is to speak as declaring His own powers.<note n="644" id="iii.XV-p148.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p149">[Or, “is spoken of manifesting His
power.”—R.]</p></note> For as that city can by no means be hidden, so it was impossible that
what they preached should sink into silence and obscurity. Thus, since
He had spoken of persecutions and calumnies, of plots and wars, for
fear they might think that these would have power to stop their mouths;
to encourage them, He saith, that so far from being hid, it should
over-shine the whole world; and that on this very account they should
be illustrious and renowned.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p150">By this then He declares His own power. In what follows,
He requires that boldness of speech which was due on their part; thus
saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p151">“Neither do men light a candle and put it under
the bushel, but on the candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that
are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
Heaven.”<note n="645" id="iii.XV-p151.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p152"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 15, 16" id="iii.XV-p152.1" parsed="|Matt|5|15|5|16" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.15-Matt.5.16">Matt. v.
15, 16</scripRef>. [R.V., “Neither
do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and
it shineth unto all that are in the house. Even so let your light
shine,” etc.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p153">“For I,” saith He, “it is true, have
kindled the light, but its continuing to burn, let that come of your
diligence: not for your own sakes alone, but also for their sake, who
are to profit by these rays, and to be guided unto the truth. Since the
calumnies surely shall not be able to obscure your brightness, if you
be still living a strict life, and as becomes those who are to convert
the whole world. Show forth therefore a life worthy of His grace; that
even as it is everywhere preached, so this light may everywhere
accompany the same.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p154">Next He sets before them another sort of gain, besides
the salvation of mankind, enough to make them strive earnestly, and to
lead them unto all diligence. As thus, “Ye shall not only,”
saith He, “amend the world, if ye live aright, but ye will also
give occasion that God shall be glorified; even as if ye do the
contrary, ye will both destroy men, and make God’s name to be
blasphemed.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p155">And how, it may be asked, shall God be glorified through
us, if at least men are to speak evil of us? Nay, not all men, and even
they themselves who in envy do this, will in their conscience admire
and approve you; even as the outward flatterers of such as live in
wickedness do in mind accuse them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p156">What then? Dost thou command us to live for display and
vain glory? Far from it; I say not this; for I did not say, “Give
ye diligence to bring forward your own good deeds,” neither did I
say, “Show them;” but “Let your light shine.”
That is, “Let your virtue be great, and the fire abundant, and
the light unspeakable.” For when virtue is so great, it cannot
lie hid, though its pursuer shade it over ten thousand fold. Present
unto them an irreprehensible life, and let them have no true occasion
of evil speaking; and then, though there be thousands of evil-speakers,
no man shall be able to cast any shade upon you. And well did He say,
“your light,” for nothing makes a man so illustrious, how
manifold soever his will to be concealed, as the manifestation of
virtue. For as if he were clad with the very sunbeam, so he shines, yet
brighter than it; not spending his rays on earth, but surmounting also
Heaven itself.</p>

<pb n="96" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_96.html" id="iii.XV-Page_96" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p157">Hence also He comforts them more abundantly. For,
“What though the slander pain you,” saith He; “yet
shall ye have many to honor God on your account. And in both ways your
recompence is gathering, as well because God is glorified through you,
as because ye are defamed for God’s sake. Thus, lest we should on
purpose seek to be reproached, on hearing that there is a reward for
it: first, He hath not expressed that sentiment simply, but with two
limitations, namely, when what is said is false, and when it is for
God’s sake:—and next He signifies how not that only, but
also good report, hath its great profit, the glory of it passing on to
God. And He holds out to them those gracious hopes. “For,”
saith He, “the calumny of the wicked avails not so much as to put
all others in the dark, in respect of seeing your light. For then only
when you have “lost your savor” shall they tread you under
foot; but not when you are falsely accused, doing right. Yea, rather
then shall there be many admiring, not you only, but for your sake your
Father also.” And He said not “God,” but “your
Father;” already sowing beforehand the seeds of that noble birth,
which was about to be bestowed upon them. Moreover, indicating His
parity in honor, as He said above, “Grieve not when ye are evil
spoken of, for it is enough for you that for my sake you are thus
spoken of;” so here He mentions the Father: every where
manifesting His equality.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p158">12. Since then we know the gain that arises from this
earnestness, and the danger of indolence (for if our Lord be blasphemed
because of us, that were far worse than our perdition), let us
“give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
to the Church of God.”<note n="646" id="iii.XV-p158.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p159"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 32" id="iii.XV-p159.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.32">1 Cor. x.
32</scripRef>.</p></note> And while the life which we present before them is brighter than the
sun, yet if any one will speak evil of us, let us not grieve at being
defamed, but only if we be defamed with justice.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p160">For, on the one hand, if we live in wickedness, though
there be none to speak ill of us, we shall be the most wretched of all
men: on the other hand, if we apply ourselves to virtue, though the
whole world speak evil of us, at that very time we shall be more
enviable than any. And we shall draw on to follow us all who choose to
be saved, for not the calumny of the wicked, but our good life, will
draw their attention. For indeed no trumpet is so clear as the proof
that is given by our actions: neither is the light itself so
transparent as a pure life, though our calumniators be beyond
number.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p161">I say, if all the above-mentioned qualities be ours; if
we be meek and lowly and merciful; if we be pure, and peacemakers; if
hearing reproach, we revile not again, but rather rejoice; then shall
we attract all that observe us no less than the miracles do. And all
will be kindly disposed towards us, though one be a wild beast, a
demon, or what you will.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p162">Or if there should even be some who speak evil of thee,
be not thou at all troubled thereat, nor because they revile thee in
public, regard it; but search into their conscience, and thou shalt see
them applauding and admiring thee, and numbering up ten thousand
praises.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p163">See, for instance, how Nebuchadnezzar praises the
children in the furnace; yet surely he was an adversary and an enemy.
But upon seeing them stand nobly, he proclaims their triumph, and
crowns them: and that for nought else, but because they disobeyed him,
and hearkened unto the law of God. For the devil, when he sees himself
effecting nothing, from that time departs, fearing lest he should be
the cause of our winning more crowns. And when he is gone, even one who
is abominable and depraved will recognize virtue, that mist being
withdrawn. Or if men still argue perversely, thou shalt have from God
the greater praise and admiration.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p164">Grieve not now, I pray thee, neither despond; since the
very apostles were to some a “savor of death;”<note n="647" id="iii.XV-p164.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p165"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 16" id="iii.XV-p165.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.16">1 Cor. ii.
16</scripRef>.</p></note>to others, a “savor of life.” And if there be nothing to
lay hold of in thyself, thou art rid of all their charges; or rather,
thou art become the more blessed. Shine out therefore in thy life, and
take no account of them who speak evil of thee. For it cannot, it
cannot be, that one careful of virtue, should not have many enemies.
However, this is nothing to the virtuous man. For by such means his
brightness will increase the more abundantly.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p166">Let us then, bearing these things in mind, look to one
object only; how to order our own life with strictness. For thus we
shall also guide to the life that is there, such as are now sitting in
darkness. For such is the virtue of that light, as not only to shine
here, but also to conduct its followers thither. For when men see us
despising all things present, and preparing ourselves for that which is
to come, our actions will persuade them sooner than any discourse. For
who is there so senseless, that at sight of one, who within a day or
two was living in luxury and wealth, now stripping himself of all, and
putting on wings, and arrayed to meet both hunger and poverty, and all
hardship, and dangers, and

<pb n="97" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_97.html" id="iii.XV-Page_97" />

blood,
and slaughter, and everything that is counted dreadful; will not from
this sight derive a clear demonstration of the things which are to
come?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p167">But if we entangle ourselves in things present, and
plunge ourselves in them more and more, how will it be possible for
them to be persuaded that we are hastening to another sojourn?<note n="648" id="iii.XV-p167.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p168"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p168.1">ἀποδημαν</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p169">And what excuse after this shall we have, if the fear of
God avail not so much with us, as human glory availed with the Greek
philosophers? For some of them did really both lay aside wealth, and
despised death, that they might make a show before men; wherefore also
their hopes became vain. What plea then shall deliver us, when with so
great things set before us, and with so high a rule of self-denial laid
open to us, we are not able even to do as they did, but ruin both
ourselves and others besides? For neither is the harm so great when a
heathen commits transgression, as when a Christian doeth the same. Of
course not; for their character is already lost, but ours, by reason of
the grace of God, is even among the ungodly venerable and glorious.
Therefore when they would most revile us, and aggravate their evil
speech, they add some such taunt as, “Thou Christian:” a
taunt which they would not utter, did they not secretly entertain a
great opinion of our doctrine.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p170">Hast thou not heard how many, and how great precepts
Christ enjoined? Now when wilt thou be able to fulfill one of those
commandments, while thou leavest all, and goest about gathering
interest, tacking together usuries, setting on foot transactions of
business, buying herds of slaves, procuring silver vessels, purchasing
houses, fields, goods without end? And I would this were all. But when
to these unseasonable pursuits, thou addest even injustice, removing
landmarks,<note n="649" id="iii.XV-p170.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p171">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p171.1">γν

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p172">13. But sometimes thou showest mercy to the poor. I know
it as well as thou. But even in this again great is the mischief. For
thou doest this either in pride or in vainglory, so as not to profit
even by thy good deeds. What can be more wretched than this, to be
making thy shipwreck in the very harbor? To prevent this, when thou
hast done any good action, seek not thanks from me, that thou mayest
have God thy debtor. For, “Lend,” saith He, “unto
them from whom ye do not expect to receive.”<note n="650" id="iii.XV-p172.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p173">[Comp. <scripRef passage="Luke vi. 34" id="iii.XV-p173.1" parsed="|Luke|6|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.34">Luke

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p174">Thou hast thy Debtor; why leave Him, and require it of
me, a poor and wretched mortal? What? is that Debtor displeased, when
the debt is required of Him? What? is He poor? Is He unwilling to pay?
Seest thou not His unspeakable treasures? Seest thou not His
indescribable munificence? Lay hold then on Him, and make thy demand;
for He is pleased when one thus demands the debt of Him. Because, if He
see another required to pay for what He Himself owes, He will feel as
though He were insulted, and repay thee no more; nay, He justly finds
fault, saying, “Why, of what ingratitude hast thou convicted me?
what poverty dost thou know to be in me, that thou hastenest by me, and
resortest unto others? Hast thou lent to One, and dost thou demand the

Why, to what end dost thou display to me thy mercy shown to the poor.
What! was it I that said to thee, Give? was it from me that thou didst

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p179">“But He doth not repay the whole now.” Well,
this too He doth for thy good. For such a debtor is He: not as many,
who are anxious simply to repay that which is lent; whereas He manages
and doeth all things, with a view of investing likewise in security
that which hath been given unto Him. Therefore some, you see, He repays
here: some He assigns<note n="654" id="iii.XV-p179.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p180"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p180.1">ταμιεεται</span>

our mercifulness abundant, let us give proof of much love to man, both
by the use of our money, and by our actions. And if we see any one
ill-treated and beaten in the market-place, whether we can pay down
money, let us do it: or whether by words we may separate them, let us
not be backward. For even a word has its re

anxious endeavor, and many things besides are added, consider how great
the recompence becomes. Yea, for we too were enemies to God, and the
Only-begotten reconciled us, casting himself between, and for us
receiving stripes, and for us enduring death.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p183">Let us then likewise do our diligence to deliver from
countless evils such as are incurring them; and not as we now do, when
we see any beating and tearing one another: we are apt to stand by,
finding pleasure in the disgrace of others, and forming a devilish
amphitheatre around: than which what can be more cruel? Thou seest men
reviled, tearing each other to pieces, rending their clothes, smiting
each other’s faces, and dost thou endure to stand by quietly?</p>

miseries?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p188">“That I may receive blows myself,” saith
one; “is this also thy bidding?” Thou wilt not have to
suffer even this; but if thou shouldest, the thing would be to thee a
sort of martyrdom; for thou didst suffer on God’s behalf. And if
thou art slow to receive blows, consider that thy Lord was not slow to
endure the cross for thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p189">Since they for their part are drunken in darkness; wrath
being their tyrant and commander; and they need some one who is sound
to help them, both the wrong-doer, and he who is injured; the one that
he may be delivered from suffering evil, the other that he may cease to
do it. Draw nigh, therefore, and stretch forth the hand, thou that art
sober to him that is drunken. For there is a drunkenness of wrath too,
and that more grievous than the drunkenness of wine.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p190">Seest thou not the seamen, how, when they see any
meeting with shipwreck, they spread their sails, and set out with all
haste, to rescue those of the same craft out of the waves? Now, if
partakers in an art show so much care one for another, how much more
ought they who are partakers of the same nature to do all these things!
Because in truth here too is a shipwreck, a more grievous one than
that; for either a man under provocation blasphemes, and so throws all
away: or he forswears himself under the sway of his wrath, and that way
falls into hell: or he strikes a blow and commits murder, and thus
again suffers the very same shipwreck. Go thou then, and put a stop to
the evil; pull out them that are drowning, though thou descend into the
very depth of the surge; and having broken up the theatre of the devil,
take each one of them apart, and admonish him to quell the flame, and
to lull the waves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p191">But if the burning pile wax greater, and the furnace
more grievous, be not thou terrified; for thou hast many to help thee,
and stretch forth the hand, if thou furnish but a beginning; and above
all thou surely hast with thee the God of peace. And if thou wilt first
turn aside the flames, many others also will follow, and of what they
do well, thou wilt thyself receive the reward.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p192">Hear what precept Christ gave to the Jews, creeping as
they did upon the earth: “If thou see,” saith He,

is a much lighter thing than to lift up the fallen beast. And if we
ought to help in raising our enemies’ ass, much more our
friends’ souls: and most when the fall is more grievous; for not
into mire do these fall, but into the fire of hell, not bearing the
burden of their wrath. And thou, when thou seest thy brother lying
under the load, and the devil standing by, and kindling the pile, thou
runnest by, cruelly and unmercifully; a kind of thing not safe to do,
even where brutes are concerned.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p194">And whereas the Samaritan, seeing a wounded man,
unknown, and not at all appertaining to him, both staid, and set him on

thieves, but amongst a band of demons, and beset by anger; and this not
in a wilderness, but in the midst of the forum;

not having to lay out money, nor to hire a
beast, nor to bring him on a long way, but only to say some
words:—art thou slow to do it? and holdest back, and hurriest by
cruelly and unmercifully? And how thinkest thou, calling upon God, ever
to find Him propitious?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p195">15. But let me speak also to you, who publicly disgrace
yourselves: to him who is acting despitefully, and doing wrong. Art
thou inflicting blows? tell me; and kicking, and biting? art thou
become a wild boar, and a wild ass? and art thou not ashamed? dost thou
not blush at thus being changed into a wild beast, and betraying thine
own nobleness? For though thou be poor, thou art free; though thou be a
working man, thou art a Christian.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p196">Nay, for this very reason, that thou art poor, thou
shouldest be quiet. For fightings belong to the rich, not to the poor;
to the rich, who have many causes to force them to war. But thou, not
having the pleasure of wealth, goest about gathering to thyself the
evils of wealth, enmities, and strifes, and fightings; and takest thy
brother by the throat, and goest about to strangle him, and throwest
him down publicly in the sight of all men: and dost thou not think that
thou art thyself rather disgraced, imitating the violent passions of
the brutes; nay rather, becoming even worse than they? For they have
all things in common; they herd one with another, and go about
together: but we have nothing in common, but all in confusion:
fightings, strifes, revilings, and enmities, and insults. And we
neither reverence the heaven, unto which we are called all of us in
common; nor the earth, which He hath left free to us all in common; nor
our very nature; but wrath and the love of money sweeps all away.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p197">Hast thou not seen him who owed the ten thousand
talents, and then, after he was forgiven that debt, took his
fellow-servant by the throat for an hundred pence, what great evils he
underwent, and how he was delivered over to an endless punishment? Hast
thou not trembled at the example? Hast thou no fear, lest thou too
incur the same? For we likewise owe to our Lord many and great debts:
nevertheless, He forbears, and suffers long, and neither urges us, as
we do our fellow-servants, nor chokes and takes us by the throat; yet
surely had he been minded to exact of us but the least part thereof, we
had long ago perished.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p198">16. Let us then, beloved, bearing these things in mind,
be humbled, and feel thankful to those who are in debt to us. For they
become to us, if we command ourselves, an occasion of obtaining most
abundant pardon; and giving a little, we shall receive much. Why then
exact with violence, it being meet, though the other were minded to
pay, for thee of thine accord to excuse him, that thou mayest receive
the whole of God? But now thou doest all things, and art violent, and
contentious,<note n="659" id="iii.XV-p198.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p199">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p199.1">ὥστε</span>.]</p></note>to have none of thy debts forgiven thee; and whilst thou art thinking
to do despite unto thy neighbor, thou art thrusting the sword into
thyself, so increasing thy punishment in hell: whereas if thou wilt
show a little self-command here, thou makest thine own accounts easy.
For indeed God therefore wills us to take the lead in that kind of
bounty, that He may take occasion to repay us with increase.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XV-p200">As many therefore as stand indebted to thee, either for
money, or for trespasses, let them all go free, and require of God the
recompense of such <i>thy</i> magnanimity. For so long as they continue
indebted to thee, thou canst not have God thy debtor. But if thou let
them go free, thou wilt be able to detain thy God, and to require of
Him the recompense of so great self-restraint in bountiful measure. For
suppose a man had come up and seeing thee arresting thy debtor, had
called upon thee to let him go free, and transfer to himself thy
account with the other: he would not choose to be unfair<note n="660" id="iii.XV-p200.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XV-p201"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XV-p201.1">ἀγνωμονεν</span>.</p></note>after such remission, seeing he had passed the whole demand to himself:
how then shall God fail to repay us manifold, yea, ten thousand fold,
when for His commandment’s sake, if any be indebted to us, we
urge no complaint against them, great or small, but let them go exempt
from all liability? Let us not then think of the temporary pleasure
that springs up in us by exacting of our debtors, but of the loss,
rather, how great! which we shall thereby sustain hereafter, grievously
injuring ourselves in the things which are eternal. Rising accordingly
above all, let us forgive those who must give account to us, both their
debts and their offenses; that we may make our own accounts prove
indulgent, and that what we could not reach by all virtue besides, this
we may obtain by not bearing malice against our neighbors; and thus
enjoy the eternal blessings, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might now and always, even
forever and ever. Amen.</p>

out that which was sure to be harboring there. And what was it that was
harboring there, and making an obstacle?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p12">2. They thought that He, thus speaking, did so with a
view to the abrogation of the ancient institutions. This suspicion
therefore He heals; nor here only doth He so, but elsewhere also again.
Thus, since they accounted Him no less than an adversary of God, from
this sort of reason, namely, His not keeping the sabbath; He, to heal
such their suspicion, there also again sets forth His pleas, of which
some indeed were proper to Himself; as when He saith, “My Father
worketh, and I work;”<note n="665" id="iii.XVI-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p13"><scripRef passage="John v. 17" id="iii.XVI-p13.1" parsed="|John|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.17">John v.
17</scripRef>.</p></note>but some had in them much condescension, as when He brings forward the
sheep lost on the sabbath day,<note n="666" id="iii.XVI-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 11" id="iii.XVI-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.11">Matt. xii.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>and points out that the law is disturbed for its preservation, and
makes mention again of circumcision, as having this same effect.<note n="667" id="iii.XVI-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p15"><scripRef passage="John vii. 23" id="iii.XVI-p15.1" parsed="|John|7|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.23">John vii.
23</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p16">Wherefore we see also that He often speaks words
somewhat beneath Him, to remove the semblance of His being an adversary
of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p17">For this cause He who had raised thousands of the dead
with a word only, when He was calling Lazarus, added also a prayer; and
then, lest this should make Him appear less than Him that begat Him,
He, to correct this suspicion, added, “I said these things,
because of the people which standeth by, that they may believe that
thou hast sent me.”<note n="668" id="iii.XVI-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p18"><scripRef passage="John xi. 42" id="iii.XVI-p18.1" parsed="|John|11|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.42">John xi.
42</scripRef>. [“These
things” does not occur in the New Testament passage, but is
inserted here to complete the sense. Comp. R.V., “but because of
the multitude which standeth around I said it, that they may believe
that thou didst send me.”—R.]</p></note> And neither doth He work all things as one who acted by His own power,
that He might thoroughly correct their weakness; nor doth He all things
with prayer, lest He should leave matter of evil suspicion to them that
should follow, as though He were without strength or power: but He
mingles the latter with the former, and those again with these. Neither
doth He this indiscriminately, but with His own proper wisdom. For
while He doeth the greater works authoritatively, in the less He looks
up unto Heaven. Thus, when absolving sins, and revealing His secrets,
and opening Paradise, and driving away devils, and cleansing lepers,
and bridling death, and raising the dead by thousands, He did all by
way of command: but when, what was much less than these, He

<pb n="101" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_101.html" id="iii.XVI-Page_101" />

was causing many loaves to spring forth
out of few, then He looked up to Heaven: signifying that not through
weakness He doth this. For He who could do the greater with authority,
how in the lesser could He need prayer? But as I was saying, He doeth
this to silence their shamelessness. The same reckoning, then, I bid
thee make of His words also, when thou hearest Him speak lowly things.
For many in truth are the causes both for words and for actions of that
cast: as, for instance, that He might not be supposed alien from God;
His instructing and waiting on all men; His teaching humility; His
being encompassed with flesh; the Jews’ inability to hear all at
once; His teaching us to utter no high word of ourselves. For this
cause many times, having in His own person said much that is lowly of
Himself, the great things He leaves to be said by others. Thus He
Himself indeed, reasoning with the Jews, said, “Before Abraham
was, <span class="c20" id="iii.XVI-p18.2">I Am</span>:”<note n="669" id="iii.XVI-p18.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p19"><scripRef passage="John viii. 58" id="iii.XVI-p19.1" parsed="|John|8|58|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.58">John viii.
58</scripRef>.</p></note>but His disciple not thus, but, “In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”<note n="670" id="iii.XVI-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p20"><scripRef passage="John i. 1" id="iii.XVI-p20.1" parsed="|John|1|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.1">John i.
1</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p21">Again, that He Himself made Heaven, and earth, and sea,
and all things visible and invisible, in His own person He nowhere
expressly said: but His disciple, speaking plainly out, and suppressing
nothing, affirms this once, twice, yea often: writing that “all
things were made by Him;” and, “without Him was not one
thing made;” and, He was in the world, and the world was made by
Him.”<note n="671" id="iii.XVI-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p22"><scripRef passage="John i. 3, 10" id="iii.XVI-p22.1" parsed="|John|1|3|0|0;|John|1|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.3 Bible:John.1.10">John i. 3,
10</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p23">And why marvel, if others have said greater things of
Him than He of Himself; since (what is more) in many cases, what He
showed forth by His deeds, by His words He uttered not openly? Thus
that it was Himself who made mankind He showed clearly even by that
blind man; but when He was speaking of our formation at the beginning,
He said not, “I made,” but “He who made them, made
them male and female.”<note n="672" id="iii.XVI-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 4" id="iii.XVI-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|19|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.4">Matt. xix.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> Again, that He created the world and all things therein, He
demonstrated by the fishes, by the wine, by the loaves, by the calm in
the sea, by the sunbeam which He averted on the Cross; and by very many
things besides: but in words He hath nowhere said this plainly, though
His disciples are continually declaring it, both John, and Paul, and
Peter.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p25">For if they who night and day hear Him discourse, and
see Him work marvels; to whom He explained many things in private, and
gave so great power as even to raise the dead; whom He made so perfect,
as to forsake all things for Him: if even they, after so great virtue
and self-denial, had not strength to bear it all, before the supply of
the Spirit; how could the people of the Jews, being both void of
understanding, and far behind such excellency, and only by hazard
present when He did or said anything, how could they have been
persuaded but that He was alien from the God of all, unless he had
practised such great condescension throughout?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p26">For on this account we see that even when He was
abrogating the sabbath, He did not as of set purpose bring in such
<i>His</i> legislation, but He puts together many and various pleas of
defense. Now if, when He was about to cause one commandment to cease,
He used so much reserve in His language,<note n="673" id="iii.XVI-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p27"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p27.1">λγων
οκονομ</span>.</p></note>that He might not startle the hearers; much more, when adding to the
law, entire as it was, another entire code of laws, did He require much
management and attention, not to alarm those who were then hearing
Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p28">For this same cause, neither do we find Him teaching
everywhere clearly concerning His own Godhead. For if His adding to the
law was sure to perplex them so greatly, much more His declaring
Himself God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p29">3. Wherefore many things are uttered by Him, far below
His proper dignity, and here when He is about to proceed upon His
addition to the law, He hath used abundance for correction beforehand.
For neither was it once only that He said, “I do not abrogate the
law,” but He both repeated it again, and added another and a
greater thing; in that, to the words, “Think not that I am come
to destroy,” He subjoined, “I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfill.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p30">Now this not only obstructs the obstinacy of the Jews,
but stops also the mouths of those heretics,<note n="674" id="iii.XVI-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p31">The Gnostic and Manichæan sects.</p></note>who say that the old covenant is of the devil. For if Christ came to
destroy his tyranny, how is this covenant not only not destroyed, but
even fulfilled by Him? For He said not only, “I do not destroy
it;” though this had been enough; but “I even fulfill
it:” which are the words of one so far from opposing himself, as
to be even establishing it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p32">And how, one may ask, did He not destroy it? in what way
did He rather fulfill either the law or the prophets? The prophets He
fulfilled, inasmuch as He confirmed by His actions all that had been
said concerning Him; wherefore also the evangelist used to say in each
case, “That it might be

<pb n="102" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_102.html" id="iii.XVI-Page_102" />

fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet.” Both when
He was born,<note n="675" id="iii.XVI-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. i. 22, 23" id="iii.XVI-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|1|22|1|23" osisRef="Bible:Matt.1.22-Matt.1.23">Matt. i.
22, 23</scripRef>.</p></note>and when the children sung that wondrous hymn to Him, and when He sat
on the ass,<note n="676" id="iii.XVI-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 5-16" id="iii.XVI-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|21|5|21|16" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.5-Matt.21.16">Matt. xxi.
5–16</scripRef>.</p></note>and in very many more instances He worked this same fulfillment: all
which things must have been unfulfilled, if He had not come.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p35">But the law He fulfilled, not in one way only, but in a
second and third also. In one way, by transgressing none of the
precepts of the law. For that He did fulfill it all, hear what He saith
to John, “For thus it becometh us to fulfill all
righteousness.”<note n="677" id="iii.XVI-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p36"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 15" id="iii.XVI-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.15">Matt. iii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> And to the Jews also He said, “Which of you convinceth me of
sin.”<note n="678" id="iii.XVI-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p37"><scripRef passage="John viii. 46" id="iii.XVI-p37.1" parsed="|John|8|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.46">John viii.
46</scripRef>.</p></note> And to His disciples again, “The prince of this world cometh, and
findeth nothing in me.”<note n="679" id="iii.XVI-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p38"><scripRef passage="John xiv. 30" id="iii.XVI-p38.1" parsed="|John|14|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.30">John xiv.
30</scripRef>.</p></note> And the prophet too from the first had said that “He did no
sin.”<note n="680" id="iii.XVI-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p39"><scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 9" id="iii.XVI-p39.1" parsed="|Isa|53|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.9">Isa. liii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p40">This then was one sense in which He fulfilled it.
Another, that He did the same through us also; for this is the marvel,
that He not only Himself fulfilled it, but He granted this to us
likewise. Which thing Paul also declaring said, “Christ is the
end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth.”<note n="681" id="iii.XVI-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p41"><scripRef passage="Rom. x. 4" id="iii.XVI-p41.1" parsed="|Rom|10|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.4">Rom. x.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> And he said also, that “He judged sin in the flesh, that the
righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after
the flesh.”<note n="682" id="iii.XVI-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p42"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 3, 4" id="iii.XVI-p42.1" parsed="|Rom|8|3|8|4" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.3-Rom.8.4">Rom. viii.
3, 4</scripRef>.</p></note> And again, “Do we then make void the law through faith? God
forbid! yea, we establish the law.”<note n="683" id="iii.XVI-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p43"><scripRef passage="Rom. iii. 31" id="iii.XVI-p43.1" parsed="|Rom|3|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.3.31">Rom. iii.
31</scripRef>.</p></note> For since the law was laboring at this, to make man righteous, but had
not power, He came and brought in the way of righteousness by faith,
and so established that which the law desired: and what the law could
not by letters, this He accomplished by faith. On this account He
saith, “I am not come to destroy the law.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p44">4. But if any one will inquire accurately, he will find
also another, a third sense, in which this hath been done. Of what sort
is it then? In the sense of that future code of laws, which He was
about to deliver to them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p45">For His sayings were no repeal of the former, but a
drawing out, and filling up of them. Thus, “not to kill,”
is not annulled by the saying, Be not angry, but rather is filled up
and put in greater security: and so of all the others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p46">Wherefore, you see, as He had before unsuspectedly cast
the seeds of this teaching; so at the time when from His comparison of
the old and new commandments, He would be more distinctly suspected of
placing them in opposition, He used His corrective beforehand. For in a
covert way He had indeed already scattered those seeds, by what He had
said. Thus, “Blessed are the poor,” is the same as that we
are not to be angry; and, “Blessed are the pure in heart,”
as not to “look upon a woman for lust;” and the “not
laying up treasures on earth,” harmonizes with, “Blessed
are the merciful;” and “to mourn” also, “to be
persecuted” and “reviled,” coincide with
“entering in at the strait gate;” and, “to hunger and
thirst after righteousness,” is nothing else than that which He
saith afterwards, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,
do ye also to them.” And having declared “the peace-maker
blessed,” He again almost said the same, when He gave command
“to leave the gift,” and hasten to reconciliation with him
that was grieved, and about “agreeing with our
adversary.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p47">But there He set down the rewards of them that do right,
here rather the punishments of them who neglect practice.<note n="684" id="iii.XVI-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p48">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p48.1">τν μ
ποισυτων</span>.]</p></note> Wherefore as in that place He said, “The meek shall inherit
earth;” so here, “He who calleth his brother fool, shall be
in danger of hell-fire;” and there, “The pure in heart
shall see God;” here, he is a complete adulterer who looks
unchastely. And having there called “the peace-makers, sons of
God;” here He alarms us from another quarter, saying, “Lest
at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge.” Thus also,
whereas in the former part He blesses them that mourn, and them that
are persecuted; in the following, establishing the very same point, He
threatens destruction to them that go not that way; for, “They
that walk ‘in the broad way,’ saith He, ‘make their
end there.’” And, “Ye cannot serve God and
mammon,” seems to me the same with, “Blessed are the
merciful,” and, “those that hunger after
righteousness.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p49">But as I said, since He is going to say these things
more clearly, and not only more clearly, but also to add again more
than had been already said (for He no longer merely seeks a merciful
man, but bids us give up even our coat; not simply a meek person, but
to turn also the other cheek to him that would smite us): therefore He
first takes away the apparent contradiction.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p50">On this account, then, as I have already stated, He said
this not once only, but once and again; in that to the words,
“Think not that I am come to destroy,” He added, “I
am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p51">“For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven

<pb n="103" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_103.html" id="iii.XVI-Page_103" />

and earth pass, one jot or one tittle

from the law, till all things be accomplished.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p53">Now what He saith is like this: it cannot be that it
should remain unaccomplished, but the very least thing therein must
needs be fulfilled. Which thing He Himself performed, in that He
completed<note n="686" id="iii.XVI-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p54"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p54.1">ἀπαρτσα</span>.</p></note>it with all exactness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p55">And here He signifies to us obscurely that the fashion
of the whole world is also being changed. Nor did He set it down
without purpose, but in order to arouse the hearer, and indicate, that
He was with just cause introducing another discipline; if at least the
very works of the creation are all to be transformed, and mankind is to
be called to another country, and to a higher way of practising how to
live.<note n="687" id="iii.XVI-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p56"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p56.1">βιο

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p57">5. “Whosoever therefore shall break one of these

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p59">Thus, having rid Himself of the evil suspicion, and
having stopped the mouths of them who would fain gainsay, then at
length He proceeds to alarm, and sets down a heavy, denunciation in
support of the enactments He was entering on.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p60">For as to His having said this in behalf not of the
ancient laws, but of those which He was proceeding to enact, listen to
what follows, “For I say unto you,” saith He, “Except
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
Heaven.”<note n="689" id="iii.XVI-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p61">[<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 20" id="iii.XVI-p61.1" parsed="|Matt|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.20">Matt. v.

the phrase “the righteousness” is supplied in English; see
R.V.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p62">For if He were threatening with regard to the ancient
laws, how said He, “except it shall exceed?” since they who
did just the same as those ancients, could not exceed them on the score
of righteousness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p63">But of what kind was the required excess? Not to be
angry, not even to look upon a woman unchastely.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p64">For what cause then doth He call these commandments
“least,” though they were so great and high? Because He
Himself was about to introduce the enactment of them; for as He humbled
Himself, and speaks of Himself frequently with measure, so likewise of
His own enactments, hereby again teaching us to be modest in
everything. And besides, since there seemed to be some suspicion of
novelty, He ordered His discourse for a while with reserve.<note n="690" id="iii.XVI-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p65"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p65.1">ὑπεσταλμνω</span>
.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p66">But when thou hearest, “least in the kingdom of
Heaven,” surmise thou nothing but hell and torments. For He was
used to mean by “the kingdom,” not merely the enjoyment
thereof, but also the time of the resurrection, and that awful coming.
And how could it be reasonable, that while he who called his brother
fool, and trangressed but one commandment, falls into hell; the breaker
of them all, and instigator of others to the same, should be within the
kingdom. This therefore is not what He means, but that such a one will
be at that time least, that is, cast out, last. And he that is last
will surely then fall into hell. For, being God, He foreknew the laxity
of the many, He foreknew that some would think these sayings were
merely hyperbolical, and would argue about the laws, and say, What, if
any one call another a fool, is he punished? If one merely look on a
woman, doth he become an adulterer? For this very cause He, destroying
such insolence beforehand, hath set down the strongest denunciation
against either sort, as well them who transgress, as them who lead on
others so to do.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p67">Knowing then His threat as we do, let us neither
ourselves transgress, nor discourage such as are disposed to keep these
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p68">“But whosoever shall do and teach,” saith
He, “shall be called great.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p69">For not to ourselves alone, should we be profitable, but
to others also; since neither is the reward as great for him who guides
himself aright, as for one who with himself adds also another. For as
teaching without doing condemns the teacher (for “thou which
teachest another,” it is said, “teachest thou not
thyself”<note n="691" id="iii.XVI-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p70"><scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 21" id="iii.XVI-p70.1" parsed="|Rom|2|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.21">Rom. ii.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>?) so doing but not guiding others, lessens our reward. One ought
therefore to be chief in either work, and having first set one’s
self right, thus to proceed also to the care of the rest. For on this
account He Himself hath set the doing before the teaching; to intimate
that so most of all may one be able to teach, but in no other way. For
one will be told, “Physician, heal thyself.”<note n="692" id="iii.XVI-p70.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p71"><scripRef passage="Luke iv. 23" id="iii.XVI-p71.1" parsed="|Luke|4|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.4.23">Luke iv.

will have many to ridicule him. Or rather such a one will have no power
to teach at all, his actions uttering their voice against him. But if
he be complete in both respects, “he shall be called great in the
kingdom of Heaven.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p77">But observe, I pray thee, the increase of grace; in that
He will have His newly-come disciples better than the teachers in the
old covenant. For by “Scribes and Pharisees” here, He meant
not merely the lawless, but the well-doers. For, were they not doing
well, He would not have said they have a righteousness; neither would
He have compared the unreal to the real.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p78">And observe also here, how He commends the old law, by
making a comparison between it and the other; which kind of thing
implies it to be of the same tribe and kindred. For <i>more</i> and
<i>less</i>, is in the same kind. He doth not, you see, find fault with
the old law, but will have it made stricter. Whereas, had it been
evil,<note n="696" id="iii.XVI-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p79">There is <span class="c20" id="iii.XVI-p79.1">ms</span>. authority for
reading “of an evil one.”</p></note> He would not have required more of it; He would not have made it more
perfect, but would have cast it out.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p80">And how one may say, if it be such, doth it not bring us
into the Kingdom? It doth not now bring in them who live after the
coming of Christ, favored as they are with more strength, and bound to
strive for greater things: since as to its own foster-children, them it
doth bring in one and all. Yea, for “many shall come,”
saith He, “from east and west, and shall lie down in the bosoms
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”<note n="697" id="iii.XVI-p80.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p81"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 11" id="iii.XVI-p81.1" parsed="|Matt|8|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.11">Matt. viii.

Abraham’s bosom. And all, as many as have shone forth with
excellency in the old dispensation, shone by it, every one of them. And
Christ Himself, had it been in anything evil or alien from Him, would
not have fulfilled it all when He came. For if only to attract the Jews
He was doing this, and not in order to prove it akin to the new law,
and concurrent therewith; wherefore did He not also fulfill the laws
and customs of the Gentiles, that He might attract the Gentiles
also?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p82">So that from all considerations it is clear, that not
from any badness in itself doth it fail to bring us in, but because it
is now the season of higher precepts.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p83">And if it be more imperfect than the new, neither doth
this imply it to be evil: since upon this principle the new law itself
will be in the very same case. Because in truth our knowledge of this,
when compared with that which is to come, is a sort of partial and
imperfect thing, and is done away on the coming of that other.
“For when,” saith He, “that which is perfect is come,
then that which is in part shall be done away:”<note n="698" id="iii.XVI-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p84"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 10" id="iii.XVI-p84.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.10">1 Cor.

the new law for this, though that also gives place on our attaining
unto the Kingdom: for “then,” saith He, “that which
is in part shall be done away:” but for all this we call it
great.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p85">Since then both the rewards thereof are greater, and the
power given by the Spirit more abundant, in reason it requires our

but Heaven, and the good things in the Heavens, and adoption and
brotherhood with the Only-Begotten, and to partake of the inheritance
and to be glorified and to reign with Him, and those unnumbered
rewards. And as to our having received more abundant help, hear thou
Paul, when he saith, “There is therefore no condemnation now to

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p89">7. And now after threatening the transgressors, and
setting great rewards for them that do right, and signifying that He
justly requires of us something beyond the former measures; He from
this point begins to legislate, not simply, but by way of comparison
with the ancient ordinances, desiring to intimate these two things:
first, that not as contending with the former, but rather in great
harmony with them, He is making these enactments; next, that it was
meet and very seasonable for Him to add thereto these second
precepts.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p90">And that this may be made yet clearer, let us hearken to
the words of the Legislator. What then doth He Himself say?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p91">“Ye have heard that it was said to them of old
time, Thou shalt not kill.”<note n="702" id="iii.XVI-p91.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p92"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 21" id="iii.XVI-p92.1" parsed="|Matt|5|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.21">Matt. v.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p93">And yet it was Himself who gave those laws also, but so
far He states them impersonally. For if on the one hand He had said,
“Ye have heard that I said to them of old,” the saying
would have been hard to receive, and would have stood in the way of all
the hearers. If again, on the other hand, after having said, “Ye
have heard that it was said to them of old by my Father,” He had
added, “But I say,” He would have seemed to be taking yet
more on Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p94">Wherefore He hath simply stated it, making out thereby
one point only; the proof that in fitting season He had come saying
these things. For by the words, “It was said to them of
old,” He pointed out the length of the time, since they received
this commandment. And this He did to shame the hearer, shrinking from
the advance to the higher class of His commandments; as though a
teacher should say to a child that was indolent, “Knowest thou
not how long a time thou hast consumed in learning syllables?”
This then He also covertly intimates by the expression, “them of
old time,” and thus for the future summons them on to the higher
order of His instructions: as if He had said, “Ye are learning
these lessons long enough, and you must henceforth press on to such as
are higher than these.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p95">And it is well that He doth not disturb the order of the
commandments, but begins first with that which comes earlier, with
which the law also began. Yea, for this too suits with one showing the
harmony between them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p96">“But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with
his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p98">Seest thou authority in perfection? Seest thou a bearing

wise? which among righteous men? which among patriarchs? None; but,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p100">Let us now ask those who reject the law, “is,
‘Be not angry’ contrary to ‘Do no murder’? or
is not the one commandment the completion and the development of the
other?” Clearly the one is the fulfilling of the other, and that
is greater on this very account. Since he who is not stirred up to
anger, will much more refrain from murder; and he who bridles wrath
will much more keep his hands to himself. For wrath is the root of
murder. And you see that He who cuts up the root will much more remove
the branches; or rather, will not permit them so much as to shoot out
at all. Not therefore to abolish the law did He make these enactments,
but for the more complete observation of it. For with what design did
the law enjoin these things? Was it not, that no one might slay his
neighbor? It follows, that he who was opposing the law would have to
enjoin murder. For to murder, were the contrary to doing no murder. But
if He doth not suffer one even to be angry, the mind of the law is
established by Him more completely. For he that studies to avoid murder
will not refrain from it equally with him that hath put away even
anger; this latter being further removed from the crime.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p101">8. But that we may convict them in another way also, let
us bring forward all their allegations. What then do they affirm? They
assert that the God who made the world, who “makes His sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, who sends the rain on the just and on
the unjust,” is in some sense an evil being.<note n="705" id="iii.XVI-p101.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p102">Epiph. Hær. 41, sec. 1. “Cerdon [circ.
A.D. 150] with others preached two first principles, and so in fact two
Gods: the one good, and unknown to all: whom he also called the Father
of Jesus: the other, the Demiurgus, or artificer, evil, and open to
knowledge, who spake in the law, and appeared in the prophets, and hath
often become visible.” In this he agreed with the Oriental
heretics generally. Marcion, his disciple, within a few years improved
on him (Hær. 42, sec. 3), “saying, that there are three
principles: one, that on high, unnamed, and unseen, which it pleases
him to call the good God (this however, was not the Creator of any of
the things that are in the world): another, a visible God, Creator and
Artificer: and, in the third place, the devil.…Now the Creator,
and Artificer, and visible One, they say, is the God of the Jews, and
is also the Judge.” Cf. <i>ibid</i>. sec. 6; St. Aug. <i>de

assign for a Father to Christ. And they say that he, who is not good,
abides in his own, and preserves what are his own; but that He, that is
good, seeks what are another’s, and desires of a sudden to become
a Saviour to them whose Creator He was not.<note n="706" id="iii.XVI-p102.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p103">St. Iren. v. 2. “Vain also are those who say

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p105">In the next place, they criticise the law in the old
covenant, which bids put out “an eye for an eye,” and
“a tooth for a tooth;”<note n="708" id="iii.XVI-p105.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p106">Tertull. adv. Marcion. ii. 18; <scripRef passage="Exod. xxi. 24" id="iii.XVI-p106.1" parsed="|Exod|21|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.21.24">Exod. xxi. 24</scripRef>. “Which of the good rules of the
law should I rather defend, than those which heresy hath craved for her
own purposes? As the rule of retaliation, requiring eye for eye, tooth
for tooth, and bruise for bruise. There is no tinge here of any
permission for repaying an injury in kind, but the whole drift of it is
to restrain violence. That is, because that most stubborn and faithless
people would count it hard or even inconceivable to await God’s
redress, which the prophet was afterwards to proclaim, in the words,
‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord;’ the
commission of wrong during the interval was to be in a manner smothered
by the fear of immediate retribution.” [<i>Ante-Nicene
Fathers,</i> vol. III. p. 311.] St. Augustin (contr. Adim. c. 8), says
the same in reply to the Manichæans.</p></note>and straightway they insult and say, “Why, how can He be good who
speaks so?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p107">What then do we say in answer to this? That it is the
highest kind of philanthropy. For He made this law, not that we might
strike out one another’s eyes, but that fear of suffering by
others might restrain us from doing any such thing to them. As
therefore He threatened the Ninevites with overthrow, not that He might
destroy them, (for had that been His will, He ought to have been
silent), but that He might by fear make them better, and so quiet His
wrath: so also hath He appointed a punishment for those who wantonly
assail the eyes of others, that if good principle dispose them not to
refrain from such cruelty, fear may restrain them from injuring their
neighbors’ sight.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p108">And if this be cruelty, it is cruelty also for the
murderer to be restrained, and the adulterer checked. But these are the
sayings of senseless men, and of those that are mad to the extreme of
madness. For I, so far from saying that this comes of cruelty, should
say, that the contrary to this would be unlawful, according to
men’s reckoning. And whereas, thou sayest, “Because He
commanded to pluck out “an eye for an eye,” therefore He is
cruel;” I say, that if He had not given this commandment, then He
would have seemed, in the judgment of most men, to be that which thou
sayest He is.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p109">For let us suppose that this law had been altogether
done away, and that no one feared the punishment ensuing thereupon, but
that license had been given to all the wicked to follow their own
disposition in all security, to adulterers, and to murderers,<note n="709" id="iii.XVI-p109.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p110">[“And to thieves” should be inserted
here. The omission was probably accidental.—R.]</p></note>to perjured persons, and to parricides; would not all things have been
turned upside down? would not cities, market-places, and houses, sea
and land, and the whole world, have been filled with unnumbered
pollutions and murders? Every one sees it. For if, when there are laws,
and fear, and threatening, our evil dispositions are hardly checked;
were even this security taken away, what is there to prevent
men’s choosing vice? and what degree of mischief would not then
come revelling upon the whole of human life?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p111">The rather, since cruelty lies not only in allowing the
bad to do what they will, but in another thing too quite as much; to
overlook, and leave uncared for, him who hath done no wrong, but who is
without cause or reason suffering ill. For tell me; were any one to
gather together wicked men from all quarters, and arm them with swords,
and bid them go about the whole city, and massacre all that came in
their way, could there be anything more like a wild beast than he? And
what if some other should bind, and confine with the utmost strictness
those whom that man had armed, and should snatch from those lawless
hands them, who were on the point of being butchered; could anything be
greater humanity than this?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p112">Now then, I bid thee transfer these examples to the law
likewise; for He that commands to pluck out “an eye for an
eye,” hath laid the fear as a kind of strong chain upon the souls
of the bad, and so resembles him, who detains those assassins in
prison; whereas he who appoints no punishment for them, doth all but
arm them by such security, and acts the part of that other, who was
putting the swords in their hands, and letting them loose over the
whole city.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p113">Seest thou not, how the commandments, so far from coming
of cruelty, come rather of abounding mercy? And if on account of these
thou callest the Lawgiver grievous, and hard to bear with; tell me
which sort of command is the more toilsome and grievous, “Do no
murder,” or, “Be not even angry”? Which is more in
extreme, he who exacts a penalty for murder, or for mere anger? He who
subjects the adulterer to vengeance after the fact, or he who enjoins a
penalty even for the very desire, and that penalty everlasting? See ye
not how their reasoning comes round to the very contrary? how the God
of the old covenant, whom they call cruel, will be found mild and meek:
and He of the new, whom they acknowledged to be good, will be hard and
grievous, according to their madness? Whereas we say, that there is but
one and the same Legislator of either covenant, who dispensed all
meetly, and adapted to the difference of the times the difference
between the two systems of law. Therefore neither are the first
commandments cruel, nor the second hard and grievous, but all of one
and the same providential care.</p>

mildness; in the one He saith, “An eye for an eye,” but in

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p122">For as in that case He checks him that doth the wrong
with the fear of this suffering, even so also in this. “How
so,” it may be said, “when He bids turn to him the other
cheek also?” Nay, what of that? Since not to take away his fear
did He enjoin this, but as charging yourself to allow him to take his
fill entirely. Neither did He say, that the other continues unpunished,
but, “do not thou punish;” at once both enhancing the fear
of him that smiteth, if he persist, and comforting him who is
smitten.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p123">9. But these things we have said, as one might say them
incidentally, concerning all the commandments. Now we must go on to
that which is before us, and keep to the thread of what had been
affirmed. “He that is angry with his brother without a cause
shall be in danger of the judgment:” so He speaks. Thus He hath
not altogether taken the thing away: first, because it is not possible,
being a man, to be freed from passions: we may indeed get the dominion
over them, but to be altogether without them is out of the
question.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p124">Next, because this passion is even useful, if we know
how to use it at the suitable time.<note n="714" id="iii.XVI-p124.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p125">See Bp. Butler’s Sermon on Resentment.</p></note> See, for instance, what great good was wrought by that anger of Paul,
which he felt against the Corinthians, on that well-known occasion; and
how, as it delivered them from a grievous pest, so by the same means
again he recovered the people of the Galatians likewise, which had
fallen aside; and others too beside these. What then is the proper time
for anger? When we are not avenging ourselves, but checking others in
their lawless freaks, or forcing them to attend in their
negligence.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p126">And what is the unsuitable time? When we do so as
avenging ourselves: which Paul also forbidding, said “Avenge not

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p132">By the council in this place He means the tribunal of
the Hebrews: and He hath mentioned this now, on purpose that He might
not seem everywhere to play the stranger and innovator.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p133">But this word, “Raca,” is not an expression
of a great insolence, but rather of some contempt and slight on the
part of the speaker. For as we, giving orders either to our servants,
or to any very inferior person, say, “Away with thee; you here,
tell such an one:”<note n="718" id="iii.XVI-p133.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p134">[The original repeats the emphatic and contemptuous

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p137">To many this commandment hath appeared grievous and

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p138">For wherefore, tell me, doth the commandment seem
overburdensome? Knowest thou not that most punishments and most sins
have their beginning from words? Yea, for by words are blasphemies, and
denials are by words, and revilings, and reproaches, and perjuries, and
bearing false witness.<note n="720" id="iii.XVI-p138.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p139">[One <span class="c20" id="iii.XVI-p139.1">ms</span>. adds here <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p139.2">κα ναιρεν</span>

Greek text; while the Latin version has <i>ipsa

danger, this do thou inquire. Art thou ignorant that in the season of
enmity, when wrath is inflamed, and the soul kindled, even the least
thing appears great, and what is not very reproachful is counted
intolerable? And often these little things have given birth even to
murder, and overthrown whole cities. For just as where friendship is,
even grievous things are light, so where enmity lies beneath, very
trifles appear intolerable. And however simply a word be spoken, it is
surmised to have been spoken with an evil meaning. And as in fire: if
there be but a small spark, though thousands of planks lie by, it doth
not easily lay hold of them; but if the flame have waxed strong and
high, it readily seizes not planks only, but stones, and all materials
that fall in its way; and by what things it is usually quenched, by the
same it is kindled the more (for some say that at such a time not only
wood and tow, and the other combustibles, but even water darted forth
upon it doth but fan its power the more); so is it also with anger;
whatever any one may say, becomes food in a moment for this evil
conflagration. All which kind of evils Christ checking beforehand, had
condemned first him that is angry without a cause to the judgment,
(this being the very reason why He said, “He that is angry shall
be in danger of the judgment”); then him that saith
“Raca,” to the council. But as yet these are no great
things; for the punishments are here. Therefore for him who calleth
“fool” He hath added the fire of hell, now for the first
time mentioning the name of hell. For having before discoursed much of
the kingdom, not until then did He mention this; implying, that the
former comes of His own love and indulgence towards man, this latter of
our negligence.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p140">11. And see how He proceeds by little and little in His
punishments, all but excusing Himself unto thee, and signifying that
His desire indeed is to threaten nothing of the kind, but that we drag
Him on to such denunciations. For observe: “I bade thee,”
saith He, “not be angry for nought, because thou art in danger of
the judgment. Thou hast despised the former commandment: see what anger
hath produced; it hath led thee on straightway to insult, for thou hast
called thy brother ‘Raca.’ Again, I set another punishment,
‘the council.’ If thou overlook even this, and proceed to
that which is more grievous, I visit thee no longer with these finite
punishments, but with the undying penalty of hell, lest after this thou
shouldest break forth<note n="721" id="iii.XVI-p140.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p141"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p141.1">ἀποπηδσ</span>.</p></note>even to murder.” For there is nothing, nothing in the world more
intolerable than insolence; it is what hath very great power<note n="722" id="iii.XVI-p141.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p142"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p142.1">ὁ μλιστα

in itself more wounding than the insolence, the blaze becomes twice as
great. Think it not then a light thing to call another
“fool.” For when of that which separates us from the
brutes, and by which especially we are human beings, namely, the mind
and the understanding,—when of this thou hast robbed thy brother,
thou hast deprived him of all his nobleness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p143">Let us not then regard the words merely, but realizing
the things themselves, and his feeling, let us consider how great a
wound is made by this word, and unto how much evil it proceeds. For
this cause Paul likewise cast out of the kingdom not only “the
adulterous” and “the effeminate,” but “the
revilers”<note n="723" id="iii.XVI-p143.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p144"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 9, 10" id="iii.XVI-p144.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|9|6|10" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.9-1Cor.6.10">1 Cor. vi.

of charity, and casts upon his neighbor unnumbered ills, and works up
lasting enmities, and tears asunder the members of Christ, and is daily
driving away that peace which God so desires: giving much vantage
ground unto the devil by his injurious ways, and making him the
stronger. Therefore Christ Himself, cutting out the sinews of the
devil’s power, brought in this law.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p145">For indeed He makes much account of love: this being
above all things the mother of every good, and the badge of His
disciples, and the bond which holds together our whole condition. With
reason therefore doth He remove with great earnestness the roots and
the sources of that hatred which utterly spoils it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p146">Think not therefore that these sayings are in any wise
hyperbolical, but consider the good done by them, and admire the
mildness of these laws. For there is nothing for which God takes so
much pains, as this; that we should be united and knit together one
with another. Therefore both in His own person, and by His disciples,
as well those in the

Old, as in
the New Testament, He makes so much account of this commandment; and is
a severe avenger and punisher of those who despise the duty. For in
truth nothing so effectually gives entrance and root to all wickedness,
as the taking away of love. Wherefore He also said, “When
iniquity abounds, the love of the many shall wax cold.”<note n="724" id="iii.XVI-p146.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p147"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 12" id="iii.XVI-p147.1" parsed="|Matt|24|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.12">Matt. xxiv.

clause. Comp. R.V.—R.]</p></note> Thus Cain became his brother’s murderer; thus Esau; thus
Joseph’s brethren; thus our unnumbered crimes have come revelling
in, this bond being dissevered. You see why He Himself also roots out
whatever things injure this, on every side, with great exactness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p148">12. Neither doth He stop at those precepts only which
have been mentioned, but adds also others more than those: whereby He
signifies how much account He makes thereof. Namely, having threatened
by “the council,” by “the judgment,” and by
“hell,” He added other sayings again in harmony with the
former, saying thus:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p149">“If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p152">O goodness! O exceeding love to man! He makes no account
of the honor due unto Himself, for the sake of our love towards our
neighbor; implying that not at all from any enmity, nor out of any
desire to punish, had He uttered those former threatenings, but out of
very tender affection. For what can be milder than these sayings?
“Let my service,” saith he, “be interrupted, that thy
love may continue; since this also is a sacrifice, thy being reconciled
to thy brother.” Yea, for this cause He said not, “after
the offering,” or “before the offering;” but, while
the very gift lies there, and when the sacrifice is already beginning,
He sends thee to be reconciled to thy brother; and neither after
removing that which lies before us,<note n="727" id="iii.XVI-p152.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p153"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p153.1">συνελντα τ

Field translates this, “quickly doing the work in hand:”
alleging that the word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p153.2">συναιρεν</span> cannot
well stand for “removing.” But its strict meaning seems to
be “to pack up,” or “put into a small compass.”
So Odyss. xx. 95. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p153.3">χλαναν
μν συνελν κα
κεα, ποσιν

well enough with the word <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p153.4">προκεμενα</span>,
taken in its liturgical sense. [The technical sense of the verb is
“to contract,” and the context favors Field’s view.
The command was neither “after hastening through the service
(Latin, <i>nec propere confecto sacrificio</i>) nor before beginning
it.”—R.]</p></note>nor before presenting the gift, but while it lies in the midst, He bids
thee hasten thither.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p154">With what motive then doth He command so to do, and
wherefore? These two ends, as it appears to me, He is hereby shadowing
out and providing for. First, as I have said, His will is to point out
that He highly values charity,<note n="728" id="iii.XVI-p154.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p155">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p155.1">τν
γπην</span>, properly rendered “love”
in the next sentence.—R.]</p></note>and considers it to be the greatest sacrifice: and that without it He
doth not receive even that other; next, He is imposing such a necessity
of reconciliation, as admits of no excuse. For whoso hath been charged
not to offer before he be reconciled, will hasten, if not for love of
his neighbor, yet, that this may not lie unconsecrated,<note n="729" id="iii.XVI-p155.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p156"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVI-p156.1">ἀτλεστον</span>.</p></note>to run unto him who hath been grieved, and do away the enmity. For this
cause He hath also expressed it all most significantly, to alarm and
thoroughly to awaken him. Thus, when He had said, “Leave thy
gift,” He stayed not at this, but added, “before the
altar” (by the very place again causing him to shudder);
“and go away.” And He said not merely, “Go
away,” but He added, “first, and then come and offer thy
gift.” By all these things making it manifest, that this table
receives not them that are at enmity with each other.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p157">Let the initiated hear this, as many as draw nigh in
enmity: and let the uninitiated hear too: yea, for the saying hath some
relation to them also. For they too offer a gift and a sacrifice:
prayer, I mean, and alms-giving. For as to this also being a sacrifice,
hear what the prophet saith: “A sacrifice of praise will glorify
me;”<note n="730" id="iii.XVI-p157.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p158"><scripRef passage="Ps. l. 23" id="iii.XVI-p158.1" parsed="|Ps|50|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.50.23">Ps. l.

sacrifice.”<note n="732" id="iii.XVI-p159.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p160"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxli. 2" id="iii.XVI-p160.1" parsed="|Ps|41|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.41.2">Ps. cxli.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> So that if it be but a prayer, which thou art offering in such a frame
of mind, it were better to leave thy prayer, and become reconciled to
thy brother, and then to offer thy prayer.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p161">For to this end were all things done: to this end even
God became man, and took order for all those works, that He might set
us at one.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p162">And whereas in this place He is sending the wrong doer
to the sufferer, in His prayer He leads the sufferer to the wrong doer,
and reconciles them. For as there He saith, “Forgive men their
debts;” so here, “If he hath ought against thee, go thy way
unto him.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p163">Or rather, even here too He seems to me to be sending
the injured person: and for some such reason He said not,
“Reconcile thyself to thy brother,” but, “Be thou
rec

<pb n="110" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_110.html" id="iii.XVI-Page_110" />

onciled.” And while the
saying seems to pertain to the aggressor, the whole of it really
pertains to him that is aggrieved. Thus, “If thou art reconciled
to him,” saith Christ, “through thy love to him thou wilt
have me also propitious, and wilt be able to offer thy sacrifice with
great confidence. But if thou art still irritated, consider that even I
readily command that which is mine to be lightly esteemed, that ye may
become friends; and let these thoughts be soothing to thine
anger.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p164">And He said not, “When thou hast suffered any of
the greater wrongs, then be reconciled; but, “Though it be some
trifle that he hath against thee.” And He added not,
“Whether justly or unjustly;” but merely, “If he hath
ought against thee.” For though it be justly, not even in that
case oughtest thou to protract the enmity; since Christ also was justly
angered with us, yet nevertheless He gave Himself for us to be slain,
“not imputing those trespasses.”<note n="733" id="iii.XVI-p164.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p165"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 19" id="iii.XVI-p165.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.19">2 Cor. v.
19</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p166">For this cause Paul also, when urging us in another way
to reconciliation, said, “Let not the sun go down upon your
wrath.”<note n="734" id="iii.XVI-p166.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p167"><scripRef passage="Eph. iv. 26" id="iii.XVI-p167.1" parsed="|Eph|4|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.4.26">Eph. iv.
26</scripRef>.</p></note> For much as Christ by this argument of the sacrifice, so there Paul by
that of the day, is urging us on to the self-same point. Because in
truth he fears the night, lest it overtake him that is smitten alone,
and make the wound greater. For whereas in the day there are many to
distract, and draw him off; in the night, when he is alone, and is
thinking it over by himself, the waves swell, and the storm becomes
greater. Therefore Paul, you see, to prevent this, would fain commit
him to the night already reconciled, that the devil may after that have
no opportunity, from his solitude, to rekindle the furnace of his
wrath, and make it fiercer. Thus also Christ permits not, though it be
ever so little delay, lest, the sacrifice being accomplished, such an
one become more remiss, procrastinating from day to day: for He knows
that the case requires very speedy treatment. And as a skillful
physician exhibits not only the preventives of our diseases, but their
correctives also, even so doth He likewise. Thus, to forbid our calling
“fool,” is a preventive of enmity; but to command
reconciliation is a means of removing the diseases that ensue on the
enmity.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p168">And mark how both commands are set forth with
earnestness. For as in the former case He threatened hell, so here He
receives not the gift before the reconciliation, indicating great
displeasure, and by all these methods destroying both the root and the
produce.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p169">And first of all He saith, “Be not angry;”
and after that, “revile not.” For indeed both these are
augmented, the one by the other: from enmity is reviling, from reviling
enmity. On this account then He heals now the root, and now the fruit;
hindering indeed the evil from ever springing up in the first instance:
but if perchance it may have sprouted up and borne its most evil fruit,
then by all means He burns it down the more.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p170">13. Therefore, you see, having mentioned, first the
judgment, then the council, then hell, and having spoken of His own
sacrifice, He adds other topics again, thus speaking:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p171">“Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou
art in the way with him.”<note n="735" id="iii.XVI-p171.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p172"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 25" id="iii.XVI-p172.1" parsed="|Matt|5|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.25">Matt. v.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p173">That is, that thou mayest not say, “What then, if
I am injured;” “what if I am plundered, and dragged too
before the tribunal?” even this occasion and excuse He hath taken
away: for He commands us not even so to be at enmity. Then, since this
injunction was great, He draws His advice from the things present,
which are wont to restrain the grosser sort more than the future.
“Why, what sayest thou?” saith He. “That thine
adversary is stronger, and doeth thee wrong? Of course then he will
wrong thee more, if thou do not make it up, but art forced to go into
court. For in the former case, by giving up some money, thou wilt keep
thy person free; but when thou art come under the sentence of the
judge, thou wilt both be bound, and pay the utmost penalty. But if thou
avoid the contest there, thou wilt reap two good results: first, not
having to suffer anything painful: and secondly, that the good done
will be thereafter thine own doing, and no longer the effect of
compulsion on his part. But if thou wilt not be ruled by these sayings,
thou wrongest not him, so much as thyself.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p174">And see here also how He hastens him; for having said,
“Agree with thine adversary,” He added,
“quickly;” and He was not satisfied with this, but even of
this quickness He hath required a further increase, saying,
“Whilst thou art in the way with him;” pressing and
hastening him hereby with great earnestness. For nothing doth so much
turn our life upside down, as delay and procrastination in the
performance of our good works. Nay, this hath often caused us to lose
all. Therefore, as Paul for his part saith, “Before the sun set,
do away the enmity;” and as He Himself had said above,

<pb n="111" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_111.html" id="iii.XVI-Page_111" />

“Before the offering is completed,
be reconciled;” so He saith in this place also, “Quickly,
whilst thou art in the way with him,” before thou art come to the
doors of the court; before thou standest at the bar and art come to be
thenceforth under the sway of him that judgeth. Since, before entering
in, thou hast all in thine own control; but if thou set thy foot on
that threshold, thou wilt not by ever so earnest efforts be able to
arrange thy matters at thy will, having come under the constraint of
another.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p175">But what is it “to agree?” He means either,
“consent rather to suffer wrong?” or, “so plead the
cause, as if thou wert in the place of the other;” that thou
mayest not corrupt justice by self-love, but rather, deliberating on
another’s cause as thine own, mayest so proceed to deliver thy
vote in this matter. And if this be a great thing, marvel not; since
with this view did He set forth all those His blessings, that having
beforehand smoothed and prepared the hearer’s soul, he might
render it apter to receive all His enactments.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p176">Now some say that He obscurely signifies the devil
himself, under the name of the adversary; and bids us have nothing of
his, (for this, they say, is to “agree” with him): no
compromise being possible after our departure hence, nor anything
awaiting us, but that punishment, from which no prayers can deliver.
But to me He seems to be speaking of the judges in this world, and of
the way to the court of justice, and of this prison.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p177">For after he had abashed men by higher things, and
things future, he alarms them also by such as are in this life. Which
thing Paul also doth, using both the future and the present to sway his
hearer: as when, deterring from wickedness, he points out to him that

sooner corrected by these things, things which appear and are at hand.
Wherefore Christ also made mention, not of hell only, but also of a
court of justice, and of being dragged thither, and of the prison, and
of all the suffering there; by all these means destroying the roots of
murder. For he who neither reviles, nor goes to law, nor prolongs
enmity, how will he ever commit murder? So that from hence also it is
evident, that in the advantage of our neighbor stands our own
advantage. For he that agrees with his adversary, will benefit himself
much more; becoming free, by his own act, from courts of law, and
prisons, and the wretchedness that is there.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p180">14. Let us then be obedient to His sayings; let us not
oppose ourselves, nor be contentious; for first of all, even
antecedently to their rewards, these injunctions have their pleasure
and profit in themselves. And if to the more part they seem to be
burdensome, and the trouble which they cause, great; have it in thy
mind that thou art doing it for Christ’s sake, and the pain will
be pleasant. For if we maintain this way of reckoning at all times, we
shall experience nothing burdensome, but great will be the pleasure we
reap from every quarter; for our toil will no longer seem toil, but by
how much it is enhanced, so much the sweeter and pleasanter doth it
grow.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p181">When therefore the custom of evil things, and the desire
of wealth, keep on bewitching thee; do thou war against them with that
mode of thinking which tells us, “Great is the reward we shall
receive, for despising the pleasure which is but for a season;”
and say to thy soul; “Art thou quite dejected because I defraud
thee of pleasure? Nay, be of good cheer, for I am introducing thee into
Heaven. Thou doest it not for man’s sake, but for God’s. Be
patient therefore a little while, and thou shalt see how great is the
gain. Endure for the present life, and thou shalt receive an
unspeakable confidence.” For if we would thus discourse with our
own soul, and not only consider that which is burdensome in virtue, but
take account also of the crown that comes thereof, we shall quickly
withdraw it from all wickedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p182">For if the devil, holding out pleasure for a season, but
pain for ever, is yet strong, and prevails; seeing our case is just the
reverse in these matters, the labor temporary, the pleasure and profit
immortal, what plea shall we have, if we follow not virtue after so
great encouragement? Why, the object of our labors is enough to set
against all, and our clear persuasion that for God’s sake we are
enduring all this. For if one having the king his debtor, thinks he
hath sufficient security for all his life; consider how great will he
be, who hath made the Gracious and Everlasting God a debtor to himself,
for good deeds both small and great. Do not then allege to me labors
and sweats; for not by the hope only

<pb n="112" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_112.html" id="iii.XVI-Page_112" />

of the things to come, but in another way also,
God hath made virtue easy, assisting us everywhere, and putting His
hand to our work. And if thou wilt only contribute a little zeal,
everything else follows. For to this end He will have thee too to labor
a little, even that the victory may be thine also. And just as a king
would have his own son present indeed in the array; he would have him
shoot with the bow,<note n="738" id="iii.XVI-p182.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p183">[This clause is not found in the Greek text of
Field, nor noticed in the critical notes. The Latin version has
<i>jacula viorare</i>, and was probably inadvertently followed by the
translator.—R.]</p></note>and show himself, that the trophy may be reckoned his, while he
achieves it all Himself: even so doth God in our war against the devil:
He requires of thee one thing alone, that thou show forth a sincere
hatred against that foe. And if thou contribute this to Him, He by
Himself brings all the war to an end. Though thou burn with anger, with
desire of riches, with any tyrannical passion whatever; if He see thee
only stripping thyself and prepared against it, He comes quickly to
thee, and makes all things easy, and sets thee above the flame, as He
did those children of old in the Babylonian furnace: for they too
carried in with them nought but their good will.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVI-p184">In order then that we also may extinguish all the
furnace of disordered pleasure here, and so escape the hell that is
there, let these each day be our counsels, our cares, and our practice,
drawing towards us the favor of God, both by our full purpose
concerning good works, and by our frequent prayers. For thus even those
things which appear insupportable now, will be most easy, and light,
and lovely. Because, so long as we are in our passions, we think virtue
rugged and morose and arduous, vice desirable and most pleasing; but if
we would stand off from these but a little, then both vice will appear
abominable and unsightly, and virtue easy, mild, and much to be
desired. And this you may learn plainly from those who have done well.
Hear, for instance, how of those passions Paul is ashamed, even after
his deliverance from them, saying, “For what fruit had ye then in
those things, whereof ye are now ashamed?”<note n="739" id="iii.XVI-p184.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVI-p185"><scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 21" id="iii.XVI-p185.1" parsed="|Rom|6|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.21">Rom. vi.

But it was not as yet time to teach
any such thing about Himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p10">And besides, He was for a while practising His moral
doctrine only, being minded from this first, and from His miracles, to
convince the hearers that He was the Son of God. Now, if He had said at
once, before He had spoken or done anything, “Ye have heard that
it was said to them of old time, “I am the Lord thy God, and
there is none other but me,” but I say unto you, Worship me even
as Him; this would have made all regard Him as a madman. For if, even
after His teaching, and His so great miracles, while not even yet was
He saying this openly, they called Him possessed with a devil;<note n="745" id="iii.XVII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p11"><scripRef passage="John viii. 48" id="iii.XVII-p11.1" parsed="|John|8|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.48">John viii.

teaching, He afterwards unveiled it in words also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p13">For the present, however, by the manifestation of His
miracles, and by the very manner of His teaching, He unfolds it on
occasion, gradually and quietly. For His enacting such laws, and such
corrections of laws, with authority, would lead on the attentive and

doctrine. For it is said, “they were astonished at Him, because
He taught not as their Scribes.”<note n="746" id="iii.XVII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 28, 29" id="iii.XVII-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|7|28|7|29" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.28-Matt.7.29">Matt. vii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p15">2. For beginning from those passions, which most belong
to our whole race, anger, I mean, and desire (for it is these chiefly
that bear absolute sway within us, and are more natural than the rest);
He with great authority, even such as became a legislator, both
corrected them, and reduced them to order with all strictness. For He
said not that the adulterer merely is punished; but what He had done
with respect to the murderer, this He doth here also, punishing even
the unchaste look: to teach thee wherein lies what He had more than the
scribes. Accordingly, He saith, “He that looketh upon a woman to
lust after her hath already committed adultery with her:” that
is, he who makes it his business to be curious about bright forms, and
to hunt for elegant features, and to feast his soul with the sight, and
to fasten his eyes on fair countenances. For He came to set free from
all evil deeds not the body only, but the soul too before the body.
Thus, because in the heart we receive the grace of the Spirit, He
cleanses it out first.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p16">“And how,” one may say, “is it
possible to be freed from desire?” I answer, first, if we were
willing, even this might be deadened, and remain inactive.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p17">In the next place, He doth not here take away desire
absolutely, but that desire which springs up in men from sight. For he
that is curious to behold fair countenances, is himself chiefly the
enkindler of the furnace of that passion, and makes his own soul a
captive, and soon proceeds also to the act.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p18">Thus we see why He said not, “whosoever shall lust
to commit adultery,” but, “whosoever shall look to
lust.” And in the case of anger He laid down a certain
distinction, saying, “without a cause,” and “for
nought;” but here not so; rather once for all He took away the
desire. Yet surely both are naturally implanted, and both are set in us
for our profit; both anger, and desire: the one that we may chastise
the evil, and correct those who walk disorderly; the other that we may
have children, and that our race may be recruited by such
successions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p19">Why then did He not make a distinction here also? Nay,
very great is the distinction which, if thou attend, thou wilt see here
also included. For He said not simply, “whosoever shall
desire,” since it is possible for one to desire even when sitting
in the mountains; but, “Whosoever shall look to lust;” that
is to say, he who gathers in lust unto himself; he who, when nothing
compels him, brings in the wild beast upon his thoughts when they are
calm. For this comes no longer of nature, but of self-indulgence. This
even the ancient Scripture corrects from the first, saying,
“Contemplate not beauty which is another’s.”<note n="747" id="iii.XVII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p20"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 9.8" id="iii.XVII-p20.1" parsed="|Sir|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.9.8">Ecclus. ix. 8</scripRef>.</p></note> And then, lest any one should say, “what then, if I contemplate,
and be not taken captive,” He punishes the look, lest confiding
in this security thou shouldest some time fall into sin. “What
then,” one may say, “if I should look, and desire indeed,
but do no evil?” Even so thou art set among the adulterers. For
the Lawgiver hath pronounced it, and thou must not ask any more
questions. For thus looking once, twice, or thrice, thou wilt perhaps
have power to refrain; but if thou art continually doing this, and
kindling the furnace, thou wilt assuredly be taken; for thy station is
not beyond that nature which is common to men. As we then, if we see a
child holding a knife,

<pb n="114" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_114.html" id="iii.XVII-Page_114" />

though we
do not see him hurt, beat him, and forbid his ever holding it; so God
likewise takes away the unchaste look even before the act, lest at any
time thou shouldest fall in act also. For he who hath once kindled the
flame, even when the woman whom he hath beheld is absent, is forming by
himself continually images of shameful things, and from them often goes
on even to the deed. For this cause Christ takes away even that embrace
which is in the heart only.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p21">What now can they say, who have those virgin
inmates?<note n="748" id="iii.XVII-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p22"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVII-p22.1">τ

The practice of unmarried men, especially of the clergy, having single
young women in their houses, is a frequent object of warning and
censure both in the Homilies of the Fathers and in Church Canons. The
earliest mention of such a thing, and of the sad abuse consequent on
it, appears to be in St. Irenæus, i. 6, 3: who lays it to the
charge of the Valentinian heretics. Tertullian (<i>de Jejun. ad
fin</i>.) imputes it to the Catholics. St. Cyprian’s fourth
Epistle (ed. Fell.) was written to repress and punish an instance of it
in the Church of Carthage. It was one of the charges against Paul of
Samosata, and was forbidden by the third canon of Nicæa. See Dr.
Routh’s <i>Reliquiæ Sacræ,</i> 2,506, to which the
editor is indebted for this note. The custom seems to have prevailed
particularly at Antioch, <i>ib</i>. 482. See also an oration of
Chrysostom on this subject, vi. 214.</p></note> Why, by the tenor of this law they must be guilty of ten thousand
adulteries, daily beholding them with desire. For this cause the
blessed Job<note n="749" id="iii.XVII-p22.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p23"><scripRef passage="Job xxxi. 1" id="iii.XVII-p23.1" parsed="|Job|31|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.31.1">Job xxxi.
1</scripRef>.</p></note>also laid down this law from the beginning, blocking out from himself
on all sides this kind of gazing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p24">For in truth greater is the struggle on beholding, and
not possessing the object of fondness: nor is the pleasure so great
which we reap from the sight, as the mischief we undergo from
increasing this desire; thus making our opponent strong, and giving
more scope to the devil, and no longer<note n="750" id="iii.XVII-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p25">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVII-p25.1">οκτι
σχοντε</span>, “no longer having
strength.”—R.]</p></note>able to repulse him, now that we have brought him into our inmost
parts, and have thrown our mind open unto him. Therefore He saith,
“commit no adultery with thine eyes, and thou wilt commit none
with thy mind.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p26">For one may indeed behold in another way, such as are
the looks of the chaste; wherefore he did not altogether prohibit our
seeing, but that seeing which is accompanied with desire. And if He had
not meant this, He would have said simply, “He who looketh on a
woman.” But now He said not thus, but, “He who looketh to
lust,” “he who looketh to please his sight.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p27">For not at all to this end did God make thee eyes, that
thou shouldest thereby introduce adultery, but that, beholding His
creatures, thou shouldest admire the Artificer.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p28">Just then as one may feel wrath at random, so may one
cast looks at random; that is, when thou doest it for lust. Rather, if
thou desirest to look and find pleasure, look at thine own wife, and
love her continually; no law forbids that. But if thou art to be
curious about the beauties that belong to another, thou art injuring
both thy wife by letting thine eyes wander elsewhere, and her on whom
thou hast looked, by touching her unlawfully. Since, although thou hast
not touched her with the hand, yet hast thou caressed her with thine
eyes; for which cause this also is accounted adultery, and before that
great penalty draws after it no slight one of its own. For then all
within him is filled with disquiet and turmoil, and great is the
tempest, and most grievous the pain, and no captive nor person in
chains can be worse off than a man in this state of mind. And
oftentimes she who hath shot the dart is flown away, while the wound
even so remains. Or rather, it is not she who hath shot the dart, but
thou gavest thyself the fatal wound, by thine unchaste look. And this I
say to free modest women from the charge: since assuredly, should one
deck herself out, and invite towards herself the eyes of such as fall
in her way; even though she smite not him that meets with her, she
incurs the utmost penalty: for she mixed the poison, she prepared the
hemlock, even though she did not offer the cup. Or rather, she did also
offer the cup, though no one were found to drink it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p29">3. “Why then doth He not discourse with them
also?” it may be said. Because the laws which He appoints are in
every case common, although He seem to address Himself unto men only.
For in discoursing with the head, He makes His admonition common to the
whole body also. For woman and man He knows as one living creature, and
nowhere distinguishes their kind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p30">But if thou desirest to hear also His rebuke for them in

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p39">Thus, lest thou shouldest say, “But what if she be
akin to me? what if in any other way she belong to me?” therefore
He hath given these injunctions; not discoursing about our
limbs;—far from it,—for nowhere doth He say that our flesh
is to be blamed for things, but everywhere it is the evil mind that is
accused. For it is not the eye that sees, but the mind and the thought.
Often, for instance, we being wholly turned elsewhere, our eye sees not
those who are present. So that the matter does not entirely depend upon
its working. Again, had He been speaking of members of the body, He
would not have said it of one eye, nor of the right eye only, but of
both. For he who is offended by his right eye, most evidently will
incur the same evil by his left also. Why then did He mention the right
eye, and add the hand? To show thee that not of limbs is He speaking,
but of them who are near unto us. Thus, “If,” saith He,
“thou so lovest any one, as though he were in stead of a right
eye; if thou thinkest him so profitable to thee as to esteem him in the
place of a hand, and he hurts thy soul; even these do thou cut
off.” And see the emphasis; for He saith not, “Withdraw
from him,” but to show the fullness of the separation,
“pluck it out,” saith He, “and cast it from
thee.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p40">Then, forasmuch as His injunction was sharp, He shows
also the gain on either hand, both from the benefits and from the
evils, continuing in the metaphor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p41">“For it is profitable for thee,” saith He,
“that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole
body should be cast into hell.”<note n="757" id="iii.XVII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p42">[<scripRef passage="Matt. v. 29, 30" id="iii.XVII-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|5|29|5|30" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.29-Matt.5.30">Matt. v.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p43">For while he neither saves himself, nor fails to destroy
thee too, what kindness is it for both to sink, whereas if they were
separated, one at least might have been preserved?</p>

accursed?<note n="758" id="iii.XVII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p45"><scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 3" id="iii.XVII-p45.1" parsed="|Rom|9|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.3">Rom. ix.

of others. But in this case the mischief pertains to both. And
therefore He said not, “pluck out” only, but also
“cast from thee:” to receive him again no more, if he
continue as he is. For so shalt thou both deliver him from a heavier
charge, and free thyself from ruin.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p46">But that thou mayest see yet more clearly the profit of
this law; let us, if you please, try what hath been said, in the case
of the body itself, by way of supposition. I mean, if choice were
given, and thou must either, keeping thine eye, be cast into a pit and
perish, or plucking it out, preserve the rest of thy body; wouldest
thou not of course accept the latter? It is plain to everyone. For this
were not to act as one hating the eye, but as one loving the rest of
the body. This same reckoning do thou make with regard to men also and
women: that if he who harms thee by his friendship should continue
incurable, his being thus cut off will both free thee from all
mischief, and he also will himself be delivered from the heavier
charges, not having to answer for thy destruction along with his own
evil deeds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p47">Seest thou how full the law is of gentleness and tender
care, and that which seems to men in general to be severity, how much
love towards man it discloses?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p48">Let them hearken to these things, who hasten to the
theatres, and make themselves adulterers every day. For if the law
commands to cut off him, whose connexion with us tends to our hurt;
what plea can they have, who, by their haunting those places, attract
towards them daily those even that have not yet become known to them,
and procure to themselves occasions of ruin without number?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p49">For henceforth, He not only forbids us to look
unchastely, but having signified the mischief thence ensuing, He even
straitens the law as He goes on, commanding to cut off, and dissever,
and cast somewhere far away. And all this He ordains, who hath
uttered<note n="759" id="iii.XVII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVII-p50.1">κινσα</span>.</p></note>words beyond number about love, that in either way thou mightest learn

forbidden to cast her out, and to bring

<pb n="116" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_116.html" id="iii.XVII-Page_116" />

home another instead of her. The law however did not
command him simply to do this, but after giving the woman a writing of
divorcement, that it might not be in her power to return to him again;
that so at least the figure of the marriage might remain.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p56">For if He had not enjoined this, but it were lawful
first to cast her out, and take another, then afterwards to take back
the former, the confusion was sure to be great, all men continually
taking each others’ wives; and the matter thenceforth would have
been direct adultery. With a view to this, He devised, as no small
mitigation, the writing of divorcement.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p57">But these things were done by reason of another, a far
greater wickedness; I mean, had He made it necessary to keep in the
house her even that was hated, the husband, hating, would have killed
her. For such was the race of the Jews. For they who did not spare
children, who slew prophets, and “shed blood as
water,”<note n="763" id="iii.XVII-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p58"><scripRef passage="Ps. lxxix. 3" id="iii.XVII-p58.1" parsed="|Ps|79|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.79.3">Ps. lxxix.

allowed the less, to remove the greater evil. For that this was not a
primary<note n="764" id="iii.XVII-p58.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p59"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVII-p59.1">προηγομενο</span>.</p></note>law, hear Him saying, “Moses wrote these things according to the
hardness of your hearts,”<note n="765" id="iii.XVII-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p60"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 8" id="iii.XVII-p60.1" parsed="|Matt|19|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.8">Matt. xix.
8</scripRef>. [R.V. “for your
hardness of heart.”—R.]</p></note>that ye might not slay them in the house, but rather put them out. But
forasmuch as He had taken away all wrath, having forbidden not murder
only, but even the mere feeling of anger, He with ease introduces this
law likewise. With this view also He is ever bringing to mind the
former words, to signify that His sayings are not contrary to them, but
in agreement: that He is enforcing, not overthrowing them; perfecting,
not doing them away.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p61">And observe Him everywhere addressing His discourse to
the man. Thus, “He that putteth away his wife,” saith He,
“causeth her to commit adultery, and he that marrieth a woman put
away, committeth adultery.” That is, the former, though he take
not another wife, by that act alone hath made himself liable to blame,
having made the first an adulteress; the latter again is become an
adulterer by taking her who is another’s. For tell me not this,
“the other hath cast her out;” nay, for when cast out she
continues to be the wife of him that expelled her. Then lest He should
render the wife more self-willed, by throwing it all upon him who cast
her out, He hath shut against her also the doors of him who was
afterwards receiving her; in that He saith, “He who marrieth her
that is put away committeth adultery;” and so makes the woman
chaste even though unwilling, and blocks up altogether her access to
all, and suffers her not to give an occasion for jealousy.<note n="766" id="iii.XVII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p62"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVII-p62.1">μικροψυχα</span>
.</p></note> For she who hath been made aware that she positively must either keep
the husband, who was originally allotted to her, or being cast out of
that house, not have any other refuge;—she even against her will
was compelled to make the best of her consort.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p63">And if He discourse not at all unto her concerning these
things, marvel not; for the woman is rather a weak creature.<note n="767" id="iii.XVII-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p64">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVII-p64.1">ἀσθενστερον
γρ γυν</span>. The translator paraphrases this
as above, giving an unnecessary tone of depreciation to the
language.—R.]</p></note> For this cause letting her go, in his threatening against the men He
fully corrects her remissness. Just as if any one who had a prodigal
child, leaving him, should rebuke those who make him such, and forbid
them to have intercourse, or to approach him. And if that be galling,
call to mind, I pray thee, His former sayings, on what terms He had
blessed His hearers; and thou wilt see that it is very possible and
easy. For he that is meek, and a peacemaker, and poor in spirit, and
merciful, how shall he cast out his wife? He that is used to reconcile
others, how shall he be at variance with her that is his own?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p65">And not thus only, but in another way also He hath
lightened the enactment: forasmuch as even for him He leaves one manner
of dismissal, when He saith, “Except for the cause of
fornication;” since the matter had else come round again to the
same issue. For if He had commanded to keep her in the house, though
defiling herself with many, He would have made the matter end again in
adultery.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p66">Seest thou how these sayings agree with what had gone
before? For he who looks not with unchaste eyes upon another woman,
will not commit whoredom; and not committing whoredom, he will give no
occasion to the husband to cast out his wife.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p67">Therefore, you see, after this He presses the point
without reserve, and builds up this fear as a bulwark, urging on the
husband the great danger, if he do cast her out, in that he makes
himself accountable for her adultery. Thus, lest thou being told,
“pluck out the eye,” shouldest suppose this to be said even
of a wife: He added in good time this corrective, in one way only
giving leave to cast her out, but no otherwise.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p70">Why did He go straightway not to theft, but to false
witness, passing over that commandment? Because he that steals, doth
upon occasion swear also; but he that knows not either swearing or
speaking falsehood, much less will he choose to steal. So that by this
He hath overthrown the other sin likewise: since falsehood comes of
stealing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p71">But what means, “Thou shalt perform unto the Lord
thine oaths?”<note n="769" id="iii.XVII-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p72">See <scripRef passage="Num. xxx. 2; Deut. xxiii. 23" id="iii.XVII-p72.1" parsed="|Num|30|2|0|0;|Deut|23|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.30.2 Bible:Deut.23.23">Num.

say unto you, swear not at all.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p73">Next, to lead them farther away from swearing by God, He
saith, “Neither by Heaven, for it is God’s throne, nor by
the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, for
it is the city of the great King:”<note n="770" id="iii.XVII-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p74"><scripRef passage="Isa. lxxvi. 1; Ps. xlviii. 2" id="iii.XVII-p74.1" parsed="|Isa|76|1|0|0;|Ps|48|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.76.1 Bible:Ps.48.2">Isa. lxxvi.

not to be opposed to the ancients. This was because they had a custom
of swearing by these objects, and he intimates this custom near the end
of his Gospel.<note n="771" id="iii.XVII-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p75"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 16" id="iii.XVII-p75.1" parsed="|Matt|23|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.16">Matt.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p76">But mark, I pray thee, on what ground He magnifies the
elements; not from their own nature, but from God’s relation to
them, such as it had been in condescension declared. For because the
tyranny of idolatry was great, that the elements might not be thought
worthy of honor for their own sake, He hath assigned this cause, which
we have mentioned, which again would pass on to the glory of God. For
He neither said, “because Heaven is beautiful and great,”
nor, “because earth is profitable;” but “because the
one is God’s throne, the other His footstool;” on every
side urging them on towards their Lord.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p77">“Neither by thy head,” saith He,
“because thou canst not make one hair white or black.”<note n="772" id="iii.XVII-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p78"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 36" id="iii.XVII-p78.1" parsed="|Matt|5|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.36">Matt. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p79">Here again, not as wondering at man, hath He withdrawn
him from swearing by his head (for so man himself would be worshipped),
but as referring the glory to God, and signifying that thou art not
master even of thyself, and of course therefore not of the oaths made
by thy head. For if no one would give up his own child to another, much
more will not God give up His own work to thee. For though it be thy
head, yet is it the property of another; and so far from being master
thereof, thou shalt not be able to do with it, no not the least thing
of all. For He said not, “Thou canst not make one hair
grow;” but, “Not so much as change its quality.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p80">“But what,” it may be said, “if any
one should require an oath, and apply constraint?” Let the fear
of God be more powerful than the constraint: since, if thou art to
bring forward such excuses, thou wilt keep none of the things which are
enjoined.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p81">Yea, for first with respect to thy wife thou wilt say,
“what if she be contentious and extravagant;” and then as
to the right eye, “what if I love it, and am quite on
fire?” and of the unchaste look, “what then, if I cannot
help seeing?” and of our anger against a brother, “what if
I be hasty, and not able to govern my tongue?” and in general,
all His sayings thou mayest on this wise trample under foot. Yet surely
with regard to human laws thou darest not in any case use this
allegation, nor say, “what then if this or that be the
case,” but, willing or unwilling, thou receivest what is
written.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p82">And besides, thou wilt never have compulsion to undergo
at all. For he that hath hearkened unto those former blessings, and
hath framed himself to be such as Christ enjoined, will have no such
constraint to endure from any, being held in reverence and veneration
by all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p85">What is it then that “exceeds yea” and
“nay”? it is the oath, not the perjury. For this latter is
quite acknowledged, and no man needs to learn that it is of the evil
one; and it is not an excess, but an opposite: whereas an excess means
something more, and added over and above: which kind of thing swearing
is.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p86">“What then,” saith one, “was it of the
evil one? and if it was of the evil one, how was it a law?” Well,
this same thing thou wilt say concerning the wife also; how is that now
accounted adultery, which was before permitted?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p87">What now may one reply to this? That the precepts then
uttered had reference to the weakness of them who were receiving the
laws; since also to be worshipped with the vapor of sacrifice is very
unworthy of God, just as to lisp is unworthy of a philosopher. That
kind of thing accordingly was now laid down to be adultery, and
swearing to be of the evil one, now that the principles of virtue

<pb n="118" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_118.html" id="iii.XVII-Page_118" />

have advanced. But if these things had
been, from the first, laws of the devil, they would not have attained
to so great goodness. Yea, for had those not been forerunners in the
first place, these which we now have would not have been so easily
received. Do not thou then require their excellency now, when their use
is past: but then, when the time was calling for them. Or rather, if
thou wilt, even now: yea, for now also is their virtue shown: and most
of all for the very cause, by reason of which we find fault with them.
For their appearing such now, is the greatest commendation of them. For
had they not brought us up well, and made us meet for the reception of
the greater precepts, they would not have appeared such.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p88">Therefore as the breast, when it hath fulfilled all its
part, and is dismissing the child to the more manly diet, after that
appears useless; and the parents who before thought it necessary for
the babe, now abuse it with ten thousand mockeries (and many even not
content with words of abuse, anoint it also with bitter drugs; that
when their words have not power to remove the child’s
unseasonable propensity towards it, the real things may quench their
longing): so also Christ saith, that they are of the evil one, not to
indicate that the old law is of the devil, but in order that with most
exceeding earnestness He might lead them away from their ancient
poverty. And to them He saith these things; but with regard to the
Jews, who were insensible and persevered in the same ways, He hath
anointed their city all round with the terror of captivity, as with
some bitter drug, and made it inaccessible. But since not even this had
power to restrain them, but they desired to see it again, running to
it, just as a child to the breast, He hid it from them altogether; both
pulling it down, and leading away the more part of them far from it: as
it is with our cattle; many, by shutting out the calves, in time induce
them to forego their old familiar use of the milk.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p89">But if the old law had belonged to the devil, it would
not have led people away from idolatry, but rather would have drawn
them on and cast them into it; for this did the devil desire. But now
we see the opposite effect produced by the old law. And indeed this
very thing, the oath, was ordained of old for this cause, that they
might not swear by the idols. For “ye shall swear,” saith
He, “by the true God.”<note n="774" id="iii.XVII-p89.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p90"><scripRef passage="Jer. iv. 2" id="iii.XVII-p90.1" parsed="|Jer|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.4.2">Jer. iv.

very great. For that they came unto the “strong meat,” was
the work of its care.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p91">“What then,” it may be said, “is not
swearing of the evil one?” Yes, indeed it is altogether of the
evil one; that is, now, after so high a rule of self-restraint; but
then not so.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p92">“But how,” one may say, “should the
same thing become at one time good, at another time not good?”
Nay, I say the very contrary: how could it help becoming good and not
good, while all things are crying aloud, that they are so: the arts,
the fruits of the earth, and all things else?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p93">See it, for example, taking place first in our own kind.
Thus, to be carried, in the earliest age of life, is good, but
afterwards pernicious; to eat food that hath been softened in the
mouth, in the first scene of our life, is good, but afterwards it is
full of disgust; to be fed upon milk and to fly to the breast, is at
first profitable and healthful, but tends afterwards to decay and harm.
Seest thou how the same actions, by reason of the times, appear good,
and again not so? Yea, and to wear the robe of a child is well as long
as you are a boy, but contrariwise, when you are become a man, it is
disgraceful. Wouldest thou learn of the contrary case too, how to the
child again the things of the man are unsuited? Give the boy a
man’s robe, and great will be the laughter; and greater the
danger, he being often upset in walking after that fashion. Allow him
to handle public affairs, and to traffic, and sow, and reap, and great
again will be the laughter.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p100">And let us be diligent, if we would attain unto the
kingdom, to show forth something more than the old commandments; since
we cannot otherwise lay hold of the things of Heaven. For if we arrive

righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye cannot enter into the
kingdom of Heaven.”<note n="779" id="iii.XVII-p100.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p101"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 20" id="iii.XVII-p101.1" parsed="|Matt|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.20">Matt. v.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p102">6. Yet, although so heavy a threat is set down, there
are some who so far from over-passing this righteousness, even come
short of it; so far from shunning oaths, they even swear falsely; so
far from avoiding an unchaste gaze, they even fall into the very act of
wickedness. And all the rest of the things which are forbidden, they
dare to do, as though past feeling: waiting for one thing only, the day
of punishment, and the time when they are to pay the most extreme
penalty for their misdoings. And this is the portion of those only who
have ended their lives in wickedness. For these have reason to despair,
and thenceforth to expect nothing else but punishment; whereas they who
are yet here, may have power both to renew the fight and to conquer and
be crowned with ease.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p103">Despond not therefore, O man, neither put away thy noble
earnestness; for in truth the things are not grievous, which are
enjoined. What trouble is it, I pray thee, to shun an oath? What, does
it cost any money? Is it sweat and hardship? It is enough to have
willed only, and the whole is done.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p105">Consider, for example, how among the Greeks, in many
instances, persons lisping have entirely cured by much practice their

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p110">This therefore I also now say unto you; consider the
philosophers of the Greeks; and then ye will know of how great
punishment we are worthy, who disobey the laws of God: in that they for
seemliness before men have taken exceeding pains, and you bestow not
the same diligence, no, not for the things of Heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p111">But if thou shouldest reply, “Habit has a
wonderful power to beguile even those who are very much in
earnest:” this I likewise acknowledge; however, there is another
thing which I say with it; that as it is powerful to beguile, so also
is it easy to be corrected. For if thou wilt set over thyself at home
many to watch thee, such as thy servant, thy wife, thy friend, thou
wilt easily break off from the bad habits, being hard pressed and
closely restrained by all. If thou succeed in doing this for ten days
only, thou wilt after that no longer need any further time, but all
will be secured to thee, rooted anew in the firmness of the most
excellent habit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p112">When therefore thou art beginning to correct this,
though thou shouldest transgress thy law a first, a second, a third, a
twentieth time, do not despair, but rise up again, and resume the same
diligence, and thou wilt surely prevail.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVII-p113">For perjury surely is no trifling mischief. If to swear
is of the evil one, how great the penalty which false swearing will
bring! Did ye give praise to what hath been said?<note n="783" id="iii.XVII-p113.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVII-p114">See St. Chrys. on 1 Cor. Hom. IV. and the note

wish, that quietly and intelligently listening, you should do what is
said. This is the applause, this the panegyric for me. But if thou
praisest what I say, but doest not what thou applaudest, greater is the
punishment, more aggravated the accusation: and to us it is shame and
ridicule. For the things here present are no dramatic spectacle;
neither do ye now sit gazing on actors, that ye may merely applaud.
This place is a spiritual school. Wherefore also there is but one thing
aimed at, duly to perform the things that have been spoken, and to show
forth our obedience by our works. For then only shall we have obtained

the truth, we have fairly given up in despair. For I have not ceased

<p class="c53" id="iii.XVIII-p3"><i>“Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye

not the evil:</i><note n="787" id="iii.XVIII-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p4">[R.V. text, “him that is evil.”
Chrysostom interprets <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p4.1">τ
πονηρ</span>, “the evil one.” In
verse 40 the R.V. renders “would go to law with
thee.”—R.]</p></note><i>but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the
other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
coat, let him have thy cloak also.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.XVIII-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XVIII-p5.1">Seest</span> thou that it was not of
an eye that He was speaking before, when He made the law to pluck out
the offending eye, but of him who by his friendship is harming us, and
casting us into the gulf of destruction? For He who in this place uses
so great strength of expression, and who, not even when another is
plucking out your eye, permits you to strike out his; how should He
have made it a law to strike out one’s own?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p6">But if any one accuses the ancient law, because it
commands such retaliation, he seems to me very unskillful in the wisdom
that becomes a legislator, and ignorant of the virtue of opportunities,
and the gain of condescension. For if he considered who were the
hearers of these sayings, and how they

<pb n="121" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_121.html" id="iii.XVIII-Page_121" />

were disposed, and when they received this code
of laws, he will thoroughly admit the wisdom of the Lawgiver, and will
see that it is one and the same, who made both those laws and these,
and who wrote each of them exceeding profitably, and in its due season.
Yes, for if at the beginning He had introduced these high and most
weighty commandments, men would not have received either these, or the
others; but now ordaining them severally in their due time, He hath by
the two corrected the whole world.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p7">And besides, He commanded this, not that we might strike
out one another’s eyes, but that we might keep our hands to
ourselves. For the threat of suffering hath effectually restrained our
inclination to be doing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p8">And thus in fact He is silently dropping seed of much
self-restraint, at least in that He commands to retaliate with just the
same acts. Yet surely he that began such transgression were worthy of a
greater punishment, and this the abstract nature of justice<note n="788" id="iii.XVIII-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p9"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p9.1">ὁ το δικαου
λγο</span>.</p></note>demands. But forasmuch as He was minded to mingle mercy also with
justice, He condemns him whose offenses were very great to a punishment
less than his desert: teaching us even while we suffer to show forth
great consideration.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p10">Having therefore mentioned the ancient law, and
recognized it all, He signifies again, that it is not our brother who
hath done these deeds, but the evil one. For this cause he hath also
subjoined, “But I say unto you, that ye resist not the evil
one.” He did not say, “resist not your brother,” but
“the evil one,” signifying that on his motion men dare so
to act; and in this way relaxing and secretly removing most of our
anger against the aggressor, by transferring the blame to another.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p11">“What then?” it is said, “ought we not
to resist the evil one?” Indeed we ought, but not in this way,
but as He hath commanded, by giving one’s self up to suffer
wrongfully; for thus shalt thou prevail over him. For one fire is not
quenched by another, but fire by water. And to show thee that even
under the old law he that suffered rather prevails, that he it is who
wins the crown; examine just what is done, and thou wilt see that his
advantage is great. For as he that hath begun with unjust acts, will
have himself destroyed the eyes of both, his neighbor’s and his
own (wherefore also he is justly hated of all, and ten thousand
accusations are aimed at him): so he that hath been injured, even after
his equal retaliation, will have done nothing horrible. Wherefore also
he hath many to sympathize with him, as being clear from that offense
even after he hath retaliated. And though the calamity be equal to both
parties, yet the sentence passed on it is not equal, either with God,
or with men. It should seem then, that neither is the calamity equal in
the end.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p12">Now whereas at the beginning He said, “he that is
angry with his brother without a cause,” and “he that
calleth him fool shall be in danger of hell fire,” here He
requires yet more entire self-restraint, commanding him that suffers
ill not merely to be quiet, but even to be more exceedingly earnest in
his turn,<note n="789" id="iii.XVIII-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p13"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p13.1">ἀντιφιλοτιμεσθαι</span>
.</p></note>by offering the other cheek.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p14">And this He saith, not as legislating about such a blow
as this only, but as teaching also what forbearance we should practise
in all our other trials. For just as when He saith, “whoso
calleth his brother fool, is in danger of hell,” He speaks not of
this word only, but also of all reviling; even so here also He is
making a law, not so much for our bearing it manfully, when smitten, as
that we should be undisturbed, whatever we suffer. Because of this He
both there singled out the extremest insult, and here hath set down
that which seems to be of all blows most opprobrious, the blow on the
cheek, so full of all insolence. And He commands this as having regard
both of him that strikes and of him that is stricken. Since both he
that is insulted will not think that he suffers any harm, being thus
framed to self-restraint (nay, he will not even have any sense of the
insult, as striving rather for a prize than as receiving a blow); and
he that is offering the affront will be made ashamed, and not add a
second blow, though he be fiercer than any wild beast, yea, rather will
condemn himself heartily for the former. For nothing so restrains the
wrong doers, as when the injured bear what is done with gentleness. And
it not only restrains them from rushing onward, but works upon them
also to repent for what has gone before, and in wonder at such
forbearance to draw back. And it makes them more our own, and causes
them to be slaves, not merely friends, instead of haters and enemies;
even as avenging one’s self does just the contrary: for it both
disgraces each of the two, and makes them worse, and their anger it
heightens into a greater flame; yea, often no less than death itself is
the end of it, going on from bad to worse. Wherefore He not only
forbade thee to be angry when smitten, but even enjoined thee to
satiate the

<pb n="122" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_122.html" id="iii.XVIII-Page_122" />

other’s desire,
that so neither may the former blow appear to have befallen thee
against thy will. For thus, lost as he may be to shame, thou wilt be
able to smite him with a mortal blow, rather than if thou hadst smitten
him with thine hand; or if his shamelessness be still greater, thou
wilt make him gentle in proportion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p15">2. “And if any man will sue thee at the law, and
take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.”<note n="790" id="iii.XVIII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 40" id="iii.XVIII-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|5|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.40">Matt. v.
40</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p17">For not in the matter of blows only, but of our goods
also, He would have such forbearance exhibited. Wherefore He again
employs the same strong figure.<note n="791" id="iii.XVIII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p18"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p18.1">ὑπερβολν</span>.</p></note> That is, as in the other case He commands to overcome in suffering, so
here again, by allowing ourselves to be deprived of more than the wrong
doer expected. However, He did not put it so merely, but with something
to enhance it: not saying, “give thy cloak to him that
asketh,” but “to him that would sue thee at the law,”
that is, “if he drag thee into court, and give thee
trouble.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p19">And just as, after He had bidden not to call another
fool, nor to be angry without cause, He went on and required more, in
that He commanded to offer the right cheek also; even so here, having
said, “Agree with thine adversary,” He again amplifies the
precept. For now He orders us not only to give what the other would
have, but even to show forth a greater liberality.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p20">“What then!” one may say, “am I to go
about naked?” We should not be naked, if we obeyed these sayings
with exactness; rather more abundantly than any should we be clothed.
For first, no one would attack men of this disposition; and next, if
there chanced to be any one so savage and ungentle, as to proceed even
so far, yet many more would be found to clothe him, who acted with such
self-denial, not with garments only, but even with their own flesh, if
it were possible.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p21">Further: even though one were of necessity to go about
naked on account of this sort of self-denial, neither so were it any
disgrace. Since Adam too was “naked”<note n="792" id="iii.XVIII-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p22"><scripRef passage="Gen. ii. 25" id="iii.XVIII-p22.1" parsed="|Gen|2|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.2.25">Gen. ii.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>in paradise, “and was not ashamed;” and Isaiah was
“naked, and barefoot,” and more glorious than all the
Jews;<note n="793" id="iii.XVIII-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p23"><scripRef passage="Isa. xx. 2, 3" id="iii.XVIII-p23.1" parsed="|Isa|20|2|20|3" osisRef="Bible:Isa.20.2-Isa.20.3">Isa. xx. 2,
3</scripRef>.</p></note>and Joseph<note n="794" id="iii.XVIII-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p24"><scripRef passage="Gen. xxxix. 12" id="iii.XVIII-p24.1" parsed="|Gen|39|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.39.12">Gen. xxxix.
12</scripRef>.</p></note>also, when he stripped himself, did then more than ever shine forth.
For to be thus naked is no evil, but to be so clad, as we now are, with
costly garments, this is both disgraceful and ridiculous. For this
cause, you see, those had praise of God, but these He blames, both by
prophets and by apostles.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p25">Let us not therefore suppose His injunctions impossible.
Nay, for besides their expediency, they are very easy, if we are
sober-minded; and the profit of them is so great as to be an exceeding
help, not to ourselves only, but to those also who are using us
despitefully. And in this chiefly stands their excellence, that while
they induce us to suffer wrong, they by the same means teach them also
that do the wrong to control themselves. For while he on his part
thinks it a great thing to take what belongs to others, but thou
signifiest to him, that to thee it is easy to give even what he doth
not ask: while thou bringest in liberality for a counterpoise to his
meanness, and a wise moderation to his covetousness: consider what a
lesson he will get, being taught not by sayings, but by actual deeds,
to scorn vice and to seek after virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p26">For God will have us profitable not to ourselves alone,
but to all our neighbors as well. Now if thou givest, and abstainest
from suing, thou hast sought thine own advantage only; but if thou give
him some other thing, thou hast made him too better, and so sent him
away. Of this nature is salt, which is what He would have them to be;
seeing it both recruits<note n="795" id="iii.XVIII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p27"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p27.1">συγκροτε</span>.</p></note>itself, and keeps all other bodies with which it may associate: of this
nature is light; for it shows objects both to a man’s self and to
all others. Forasmuch then as He hath set thee in the rank of these
things, help thou likewise him who is sitting in darkness, and teach
him that neither before did he take any thing by force: persuade him
that he hath done no despite. Yea, for thus thou thyself also wilt be
had in more respect and reverence, if thou signify that thou gavest
freely and wert not robbed. Make therefore his sin, through thy
moderation, an instance of thine own bounty.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p28">3. And if thou think this a great thing, wait, and thou
wilt see clearly, that neither yet hast thou attained to perfection.
For not even here doth He stop with thee, who is laying down the laws
of patient endurance, but He proceeds even further, thus saying,</p>

with him twain.”<note n="796" id="iii.XVIII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 41" id="iii.XVIII-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|5|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.41">Matt. v.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p31">Seest thou the height of self-denial? in this at least,
that after giving thy coat, and thy cloak, not even if thine enemy
should wish to use thy naked body for hardships and labors, not even so
(saith He), must thou forbid him. For He would have us possess

all things in common, both our bodies and
our goods, as with them that are in need, so with them that insult us:
for the latter comes of manliness, the former of mercifulness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p32">Because of this, He said, “If any one shall compel
thee to go one mile, go with him twain:” again leading thee
higher up, and commanding thee to show forth the same kind of
ambition.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p33">For if the things of which He spake at the beginning,
being far less than these, have so great blessings pronounced on them;
consider what sort of portion awaits them, who duly perform these, and
what they become even before their rewards, in a human and

nor blows, nor the spoiling of their property, galls them; while they
give way to no such thing, but rather add in large measure to their
endurance; reflect what kind of training their soul is undergoing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p35">On this account then, as in regard of blows, as in
regard of our goods, so in this case also, He hath bidden us act.
“For why,” saith He, “do I mention insult, and
property? Though he should want to make use of thy very own limbs for
toil and weary work, and this unjustly, do thou again conquer and
overpass His unjust desire.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p36">For “to compel”<note n="798" id="iii.XVIII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p37"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p37.1">ἀγγαρεσαι</span>. [R.V.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p46">See how He hath set the highest pinnacle on our good
deeds. For this is why He teaches not only to endure a blow, but to
offer the right cheek also; not only to add the cloak to the coat, but
to travel also two miles with him who compels thee to go one; in order
that thou mightest receive with all facility that which is much more
than these. “But what,” one may say, “is more than
these?” Not even to count as an enemy him who is doing these
things: or rather even somewhat else more than this. For He said not,
“do not hate,” but “love;” He said not,
“do not injure,” but “do good.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p47">And if any one should examine accurately, he will see
that even to these things somewhat is added, much greater than they
are. For neither did He simply command to love, but to pray.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p48">Seest thou how many steps He hath ascended, and how He
hath set us on the very summit of virtue? Nay, mark it, numbering from
the beginning. A first step is, not to begin with injustice: a second,
after he hath begun, to vindicate one’s self by equal
retaliation; a third, not to do unto him that is vexing us the same
that one hath suffered, but to be quiet; a fourth, even to give
one’s self up to suffer wrongfully; a fifth, to give up yet more
than the other, who did the wrong, wishes; a sixth, not to hate him who
hath done so; a seventh, even to love him; an eighth, to do him good
also; a ninth, to entreat God Himself on his behalf. Seest thou, what
height of self-command? Wherefore glorious too, as we see, is the
reward which it hath. That is, because the thing enjoined was great,
and needed a fervent<note n="803" id="iii.XVIII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p49"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p49.1">νεανικ</span>.</p></note>soul, and much earnestness, He appoints for it also such a reward, as
for none of the former. For He makes not mention here of earth, as with
respect to the meek; nor of comfort and mercy, as with regard to the
mourners and the merciful; nor of the kingdom of Heaven; but of that
which was more thrilling than all; our becoming like God, in

<pb n="124" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_124.html" id="iii.XVIII-Page_124" />

such wise as men might become so. For He
saith, “That ye may become like unto your Father which is in
Heaven.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p50">And observe, I pray thee, how neither in this place, nor
in the preceding parts, doth He call Him His own Father, but in that
instance, “God,” and “a great King,” when He
was discoursing about oaths, and here, “their Father.” And
this He doth, as reserving for the proper season what He had to say
touching these points.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p51">5. Then, bringing the likeness yet closer, He saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p52">“Because He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and
on the good, and sendeth rain upon just and unjust.”<note n="804" id="iii.XVIII-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p53"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 45" id="iii.XVIII-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|5|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.45">Matt. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p54">“For He too, so far from hating,” so He
speaks, “even pours benefits on those that insult Him.” Yet
surely in no respect is the case parallel, not only because of the
surpassing nature of His benefits, but also by reason of the excellence
of His dignity. For thou indeed art despised by thy fellow-slave, but
He by His slave, who hath also received ten thousand benefits from Him:
and thou indeed givest words, in praying for him, but He, deeds, very
great and marvellous, kindling the sun, and giving the annual showers.
“Nevertheless, even so I grant thee to be mine equal, in such
wise as it is possible for a man so to be.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p55">Hate not then the man that doeth thee wrong, who is
procuring thee such good things, and bringing thee to so great honor.
Curse not him that uses thee despitefully; for so hast thou undergone
the labor, but art deprived of the fruit; thou wilt bear the loss, but
lose the reward; which is of the utmost folly, having borne the more
grievous, not to bear what is less than it. “But how,”
saith one, “is it possible for this to take place?” Having
seen God become man, and descend so far, and suffer so much for thy
sake, dost thou still inquire and doubt, how it is possible to forgive
thy fellow-servants their injuriousness? Hearest thou not Him on the
cross, saying, “Forgive them, for they know not what they
do?”<note n="805" id="iii.XVIII-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p56"><scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 34" id="iii.XVIII-p56.1" parsed="|Luke|23|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.34">Luke xxiii.

received up, He sent the apostles unto the Jews that had slain Him, to
bring them His ten thousand blessings, and this, though they were to
suffer ten thousand terrors at their hands?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p58">6. But hast thou been greatly wronged? Nay, what hast
thou endured like thy Lord, bound, beaten with whips, with rods, spit
upon by servants, enduring death, and that death, which is of all
deaths the most shameful, after ten thousand favors shown? And even if
thou hast been greatly wronged, for this very cause most of all do thou
do him good, that thou mayest both make thine own crown more glorious,
and set thy brother free from the worst infirmity. For so too the
physicians, when they are kicked, and shamefully handled by the insane,
then most of all pity them, and take measures for their perfect cure,
knowing that the insult comes of the extremity of their disease. Now I
bid thee too have the same mind touching them that are plotting against
thee, and do thou so treat them that are injuring thee. For it is they
above all that are diseased, it is they who are undergoing all the
violence. Deliver him then from this grievous contumely, and grant him
to let go his anger, and set him free from that grievous demon, wrath.
Yea, for if we see persons possessed by devils, we weep for them; we do
not seek to be ourselves also possessed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p59">Now let us do this too likewise with respect to them
that are angry; for in truth the enraged are like the possessed; yea
rather, are more wretched than they, being mad with consciousness of
it. Wherefore also their frenzy is without excuse. Trample not then on
the fallen, but rather pity him. For so, should we see any one troubled
with bile, blinded and giddy, and straining to cast up this evil humor,
we stretch forth a hand, and continue to support him through his
struggles, and though we stain our garments, we regard it not, but seek
one thing only, how we may set him free from this grievous distress.
This then let us do with respect to the angry also, and continue to
bear them up when vomiting and struggling; nor let him go, until he put
from him all the bitterness. And then shall he feel toward thee the
greatest thankfulness; when he is at rest, then he will know clearly
from how great trouble thou hast released him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p60">But why do I speak of the thanks from him? for God will
straightway crown thee, and will requite thee with ten thousand honors,
because thou hast freed thy brother from a grievous disease; and that
brother too will honor thee as a master, ever reverencing thy
forbearance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p61">Seest thou not the women that are in travail, how they
bite those that stand by, and they are not pained? or rather they are
pained, but bear it bravely, and sympathize with them who are in sorrow
and are torn by

<pb n="125" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_125.html" id="iii.XVIII-Page_125" />

those pangs. These
do thou too emulate, and prove not softer than women. For after these
women have brought forth (for these men are more feeble minded than
women), then they will know thee to be a man in comparison.<note n="807" id="iii.XVIII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p62"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p62.1">σε τν

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p63">9. What then can we deserve, who are commanded to
emulate God, and are perhaps in a way not so much as to equal the
publicans? For if “to love them that love us” be the part
of publicans, sinners, and heathens: when we do not even this (and we
do it not, so long as we envy our brethren who are in honor), what
penalty shall we not incur, commanded as we are to surpass the scribes,
and taking our place below the heathens? How then shall we behold the
kingdom, I pray thee? how shall we set foot on that holy

<pb n="126" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_126.html" id="iii.XVIII-Page_126" />

threshold, who are not surpassing even the
publicans? For this He covertly signified, when He said, “Do not
even the publicans the same?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p64">And this thing most especially we may admire in His
teaching, that while in each instance He sets down with very great
fullness the prizes of the conflicts; such as “to see God,”
and “to inherit the kingdom of Heaven,” and “to
become sons of God,” and “like God,” and “to
obtain mercy,” and “to be comforted,” and “the
great reward:” if anywhere He must needs mention things grievous,
He doth this in a subdued tone. Thus in the first place, the name of
hell He hath set down once only in so many sentences; and in some other
instances too, it is with reserve that He corrects the hearer, and as
though he were managing His discourse rather in the way of shaming than
threatening him; where He saith, “do not even the publicans the
same?” and, “if the salt have lost its savor;” and,
“he shall be called least in the kingdom of Heaven.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p65">And there are places where He puts down the sin itself
by way of punishment, leaving to the hearer to infer the grievousness
of the punishment: as when He saith, “he hath committed adultery
with her in his heart;” and, “he that putteth away causeth
her to commit adultery;” and, “That which is more than
these is of the evil one.” For to them that have understanding,
instead of the mention of the punishment, the very greatness of the sin
is sufficient for correction.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p66">Wherefore also He here brings forward the heathens and
the publicans, by the quality of the person putting the disciple to
shame. Which Paul too did, saying, “Sorrow not, even as the rest
which have no hope;”<note n="808" id="iii.XVIII-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p67"><scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 13" id="iii.XVIII-p67.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.13">1 Thess.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p69">And to signify that He requires nothing very
overpowering, but a little more than was accustomed, He saith,</p>

with His rewards, and those good hopes, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p75">And He intersperses everywhere abundantly the name of
the heavens, by the very place thoroughly elevating their minds. For as
yet, I know not how, they were somewhat weak and dull.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p76">10. Let us then, bearing in mind all the things which
have been said, show forth great love even towards our enemies; and let
us cast away that ridiculous custom, to which many of the more
thoughtless give way, waiting for those that meet them to address them
first. Towards that which hath a great blessing, they have no zeal; but
what is ridiculous, that they follow after.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p77">Wherefore now dost thou not address him first?
“Because he is waiting for this,” is the reply. Nay, for
this very reason most of all thou shouldest have sprung forward to him,
that thou mightest win the crown. “No,” saith he,
“since this was his object.” And what can be worse than
this folly? That is, “Because this,” saith he, “was
his object;—to become procurer of a reward for me;—I will
not put my hand to what he has thus suggested.” Now if he first
address thee, thou gainest nothing, even though thou accost him. But if
thou be first to spring forward and speak to him, thou hast made
thyself profit of his pride, and hast gathered in a manner abundant
fruit from his obstinacy.<note n="813" id="iii.XVIII-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p78"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p78.1">ἀπονοα</span>.</p></note> What is it then but the utmost folly, when we are to reap so large
fruit from bare words, to give up the gain; and condemning him, to
stumble at the very same thing? For if thou blamest him for this, that
he first waits to be addressed by another, wherefore dost thou emulate
that same thing which thou accusest? That which thou saidst was evil,
why art thou to imitate the same as good? Seest thou how that nothing
is more senseless than a man who associates with wickedness? Wherefore,
I entreat, let us flee this evil and ridiculous practice. Yea, for ten
thousand friendships hath this pestilence overthrown, many enmities
hath it wrought.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p79">For this cause then let us anticipate them. Since we who
are commanded to take blows, and be compelled to journey,<note n="814" id="iii.XVIII-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XVIII-p80"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XVIII-p80.1">ἀγγαρευσθαι</span>.
[See note on sec. 3.—R.]</p></note>and to be stripped by enemies, and to bear it; what kind of indulgence
should we deserve, exhibiting so great contentiousness in a mere formal
address?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p81">11. “Why,” saith one, “we are despised
and spit upon, the moment we have given him up this.” And in
order that man may not despise thee, dost thou offend God? And in order
that thy frenzied fellow servant may not despise thee, dost thou
despise the Lord, who hath bestowed on thee benefits so great? Nay, if
it be amiss that thine equal

<pb n="127" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_127.html" id="iii.XVIII-Page_127" />

should
despise thee, how much more that thou shouldest despise the God that
made thee?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p82">And together with this, consider that other point also;
that when he despises thee, he is at that very moment employed in
procuring to thee a greater reward. Since for God’s sake thou
submittest to it, because thou hast hearkened to His laws. And this, to
what kind of honor is it not equal? to how many diadems? Be it my
portion both to be insulted and despised for God’s sake, rather
than to be honored by all kings; for nothing, nothing is equal to this
glory.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p83">This then let us pursue, in such wise as Himself
commanded, and making no account of the things of men, but showing
forth perfect self restraint in all things, let us so direct our own
lives. For so even now, from this very time, we shall enjoy the good
things of the heavens, and of the crowns that are there, walking as
angels among men, going about in the earth like the angelic powers, and
abiding apart from all lust, from all turmoil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XVIII-p84">And together with all these things we shall receive also
the unutterable blessings: unto which may we all attain, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, and
power, and worship, with the unoriginate Father, and the Holy and Good
Spirit, now and always, even forever and ever. Amen.</p>

to vainglory, which springs up in them that do right. For at first He
had not at all discoursed about it; it being indeed superfluous, before
He had persuaded them to do any of the things which they ought, to
teach in which way they should practise and pursue them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p6">But after He had led them on to self-command, then He
proceeds to purge away also the alloy which secretly subsists with it.
For this disease is by no means of random birth; but when we have duly
performed many of the commandments.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p7">It behooved therefore first to implant virtue, and then
to remove the passion which mars its fruit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p8">And see with what He begins, with fasting, and prayer,
and almsgiving: for in these good deeds most especially it is wont to
make its haunt. The Pharisee, for instance, was hereby puffed up, who
saith, “I fast twice a week, I give tithes of my
substance.”<note n="816" id="iii.XIX-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p9"><scripRef passage="Luke xviii. 12" id="iii.XIX-p9.1" parsed="|Luke|18|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.12">Luke xviii.

publican,<note n="817" id="iii.XIX-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p10">Or, “by the publican:” <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p10.1">τ τελν

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p12">And mark how Christ began, as though He were speaking of
some wild beast, hard to catch, and crafty to deceive him who was not
very watchful. Thus, “take heed,” saith He, “as to
your alms.” So Paul also speaks to the Philippians; “Beware
of dogs.”<note n="819" id="iii.XIX-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p13"><scripRef passage="Phil. iii. 2" id="iii.XIX-p13.1" parsed="|Phil|3|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.2">Phil. iii.

away, and unobservedly carries out all that is within.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p15">Forasmuch then as He had made much discourse about
almsgiving, and brought forward God, “Who maketh His sun to rise
on the evil and the good,”<note n="821" id="iii.XIX-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 45" id="iii.XIX-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|5|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.45">Matt. v.

had persuaded them to exult in the abundance of their giving; He
finishes by taking away also all things that encumber this fair olive
tree. For which same cause He saith, “Take heed that ye do not
your alms before men,” for that which was before mentioned, is
“God’s” almsgiving.</p>

<pb n="128" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_128.html" id="iii.XIX-Page_128" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p17">2. And when He had said, “not to do it before
men,” He added, “to be seen of them.” And though it
seems as if the same thing were said a second time, yet if any one give
particular attention, it is not the same thing, but one is different
from the other; and it hath great security, and unspeakable care and
tenderness. For it may be, both that one doing alms before men may not
do it to be seen of them, and again that one not doing it before men
may do it to be seen of them. Wherefore it is not simply the thing, but
the intent, which He both punishes and rewards. And unless such
exactness were employed, this would make many more backward about the
giving of alms, because it is not on every occasion altogether possible
to do it secretly. For this cause, setting thee free from this
restraint, He defines both the penalty and the reward not by the result
of the action, but by the intention of the doer.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p18">That is, that thou mayest not say, “What? am I
then the worse, should another see?”—“it is not
this,” saith He, “that I am seeking, but the mind that is
in thee, and the tone of what thou doest.” For His will is to
bring our soul altogether into frame, and to deliver it from every
disease. Now having, as you see, forbidden men’s acting for
display, and having taught them the penalty thence ensuing, namely, to
do it vainly, and for nought, He again rouses their spirits by putting
them in mind of the Father, and of Heaven, that not by the loss alone
He might sting them, but also shame them by the recollection of Him who
gave them being.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p19">“For ye have no reward,” saith He,
“with your Father which is in Heaven.”<note n="822" id="iii.XIX-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 1" id="iii.XIX-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.1">Matt. vi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p21">Nor even at this did He stop, but proceeds yet further,
by other motives also increasing their disgust. For as above He set
forth publicans and heathens, by the quality of the person shaming
their imitators, so also in this place the hypocrites.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p22">“Therefore when thou doest thine alms,”
saith He, “do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites
do.”<note n="823" id="iii.XIX-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p23"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 2" id="iii.XIX-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|6|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.2">Matt. vi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p24">Not that they had trumpets, but He means to display the
greatness of their frenzy, by the use of this figure of speech,
deriding and making a show<note n="824" id="iii.XIX-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p25"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p25.1">ἐκπομπεων</span>.</p></note>of them hereby.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p26">And well hath He called them “hypocrites”
for the mask was of mercy, but the spirit of cruelty and inhumanity.
For they do it, not because they pity their neighbors, but that they
themselves may enjoy credit; and this came of the utmost cruelty; while
another was perishing with hunger, to be seeking vainglory, and not
putting an end to his suffering.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p27">It is not then the giving alms which is required, but
the giving as one ought, the giving for such and such an end.<note n="825" id="iii.XIX-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p28">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p28.1">δι

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p29">Having then amply derided those men, and having handled
them so, that the hearer should be even ashamed of them, He again
corrects thoroughly the mind which is so distempered: and having said
how we ought not to act, He signifies on the other hand how we ought to
act. How then ought we to do our alms?<note n="826" id="iii.XIX-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p30">[As in the previous clause, “ought we to
act.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>

“what thy right hand doeth.”<note n="827" id="iii.XIX-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 3" id="iii.XIX-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.3">Matt. vi.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p33">Here again His enigmatical meaning is not of the hands,
but He hath put the thing hyperbolically. As thus: “If it can
be,” saith He, “for thyself not to know it, let this be the
object of thine endeavor; that, if it were possible, it may be
concealed from the very hands that minister.” It is not, as some
say, that we should hide it from wrong-headed<note n="828" id="iii.XIX-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p34"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p34.1">σκαιο</span>, literally, “on the
left hand.”</p></note>men, for He hath here commanded that it should be concealed from
all.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p35">And then the reward too; consider how great it is. For
after He had spoken of the punishment from the one, He points out also
the honor derived from the other; from either side urging them, and
leading them on to high lessons. Yea, for He is persuading them to know
that God is everywhere present, and that not by our present life are
our interests limited, but a yet more awful tribunal will receive us
when we go hence, and the account of all our doings, and honors, and
punishments: and that no one will be hid in doing anything either great
or small, though he seem to be hid from men. For all this did He darkly
signify, when He said,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p36">“Thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward
thee openly.”<note n="829" id="iii.XIX-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 4" id="iii.XIX-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.4">Matt. vi.

be accepted by Chrysostom. The R.V. properly renders “recompense

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p38">Setting for him a great and august assemblage of
spectators, and what He desires, that very thing bestowing on him in
great abundance. “For what,” saith He, “dost thou
wish? is it not to have some to be spectators of what is going on?
Behold then, thou hast some; not angels, nor archangels, but the God of
all.” And if thou desire to have men also as spectators, neither
of this desire doth He deprive thee at the fitting season, but rather
in greater abundance affords it

<pb n="129" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_129.html" id="iii.XIX-Page_129" />

unto thee. For, if thou shouldest now make a
display, thou wilt be able to make it to ten only, or twenty, or (we
will say) a hundred persons: but if thou take pains to lie hid now, God
Himself will then proclaim thee in the presence of the whole universe.
Wherefore above all, if thou wilt have men see thy good deeds, hide
them now, that then all may look on them with the more honor, God
making them manifest, and extolling them, and proclaiming them before
all. Again, whereas now they that behold will rather condemn thee as
vainglorious; when they see thee crowned, so far from condemning, they
will even admire thee, all of them. When therefore by waiting a little,
thou mayest both receive a reward, and reap greater admiration;
consider what folly it is to cast thyself out of both these; and while
thou art seeking thy reward from God, and while God is beholding, to
summon men for the display of what is going on. Why, if display must be
made of our love, to our Father above all should we make it; and this
most especially, when our Father hath the power both to crown and to
punish.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p39">And let me add, even were there no penalty, it were not
meet for him who desires glory, to let go this our theatre, and take in
exchange that of men. For who is there so wretched, as that when the
king was hastening to come and see his achievements, he would let him
go, and make up his assembly of spectators of poor men and beggars? For
this cause then, He not only commands to make no display, but even to
take pains to be concealed: it not being at all the same, not to strive
for publicity, and to strive for concealment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p40">3. “And when ye pray,” saith He, “ye
shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the
synagogues, and in the corners of the streets. Verily I say unto you,
they have their reward.”<note n="830" id="iii.XIX-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p41"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 5" id="iii.XIX-p41.1" parsed="|Matt|6|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.5">Matt. vi.

etc.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p44">These too again He calls “hypocrites,” and
very fitly; for while they are feigning to pray to God, they are
looking round after men; wearing the garb not of suppliants, but of
ridiculous persons. For he, who is to do a suppliant’s office,
letting go all other, looks to him alone, who hath power to grant his
request. But if thou leave this one, and go about wandering and casting
around thine eyes everywhere, thou wilt depart with empty hands. For
this was thine own will. Wherefore He said not, “such shall not
receive a reward,” but, “they have it out:” that is,
they shall indeed receive one, but from those of whom they themselves
desire to have it. For God wills not this: He rather for His part was
willing to bestow on men the recompence that comes from Himself; but
they seeking that which is from men, can be no longer justly entitled
to receive from Him, for whom they have done nothing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p45">But mark, I pray thee, the lovingkindness of God, in
that He promises to bestow on us a reward, even for those good things
which we ask of Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p46">Having then discredited them, who order not this duty as
they ought, both from the place and from their disposition of mind, and
having shown that they are very ridiculous: He introduces the best
manner of prayer, and again gives the reward, saying, “Enter into
thy closet.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p47">“What then,” it may be said, “ought we
not to pray in church?” Indeed we ought by all means, but in such
a spirit as this. Because everywhere God seeks the intention of all
that is done. Since even if thou shouldest enter into thy closet, and
having shut the door, shouldest do it for display, the doors will do
thee no good.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p48">It is worth observing in this case also, how exact the
definition, which He made when He said, “That they may appear
unto men.” So that even if thou shut the doors, this He desires
thee duly to perform, rather than the shutting of the doors, even to
shut the doors of the mind. For as in everything it is good to be freed
from vainglory, so most especially in prayer. For if even without this,
we wander and are distracted, when shall we attend unto the things
which we are saying, should we enter in having this disease also? And
if we who pray and beseech attend not, how do we expect God to
attend?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p49">4. But yet some there are, who after such and so earnest
charges, behave themselves so unseemly in prayer, that even when their
person is concealed, they make themselves manifest to all by their
voice, crying out disorderly,<note n="832" id="iii.XIX-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p50.1">συρφετωδ</span>.</p></note>and rendering themselves objects of ridicule both by gesture and voice.
Seest thou not that even in a market place, should any one come up
doing like this, and begging clamorously, he wilt drive away him whom
he is petitioning; but if quietly, and with the proper gesture, then he
rather wins over him that can grant the favor?</p>

<pb n="130" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_130.html" id="iii.XIX-Page_130" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p51">Let us not then make our prayer by the gesture of our
body, nor by the loudness of our voice, but by the earnestness of our
mind: neither with noise and clamor and for display, so as even to
disturb those that are near us, but with all modesty,<note n="833" id="iii.XIX-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p52"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p52.1">ἐπιεικεα</span>.</p></note>and with contrition in the mind, and with inward tears.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p53">But art thou pained in mind, and canst not help crying
aloud? yet surely it is the part of one exceedingly pained to pray and
entreat even as I have said. Since Moses too was pained, and prayed in

mystery. Seest thou not that even in the houses of kings all tumult is
put away, and great on all sides is the silence? Do thou also
therefore, entering as into a palace,—not that on the earth, but
what is far more awful than it, that which is in heaven,—show
forth great seemliness. Yea, for thou art joined to the choirs of
angels, and art in communion with archangels, and art singing with the
seraphim. And all these tribes show forth much goodly order, singing
with great awe that mystical strain, and their sacred hymns to God, the
King of all. With these then mingle thyself, when thou art praying, and
emulate their mystical order.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p60">For not unto men art thou praying, but to God, who is
everywhere present, who hears even before the voice, who knows the
secrets of the mind. If thou so pray, great is the reward thou shalt
receive.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p67">You see that when He was discoursing of almsgiving, He
removed only that mischief which comes of vainglory, and added nothing
more; neither did He say whence one should give alms; as from honest
labor, and not from rapine nor covetousness: this being abundantly
acknowledged among all. And also before that, He had thoroughly cleared
up this point, when He blessed them “that hunger after
righteousness.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p68">But touching prayer, He adds somewhat over and above;
“not to use vain repetitions.” And as there He derides the
hypocrites, so here the heathen; shaming the hearer everywhere most of
all by the vileness of the persons. For since this, in most cases, is
especially biting and stinging, I mean our appearing to be likened to
outcast persons; by this topic He dissuades them; calling
frivolousness, here, by the name of “vain repetition:” as
when we ask of God things unsuitable, kingdoms, and glory, and to get
the better of enemies, and abundance of wealth, and in general what
does not at all concern us.</p>

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p79">See how He straightway stirred up the hearer, and
reminded him of all God’s bounty in the beginning. For he who
calls God Father, by him both remission of sins, and taking away of
punishment, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, and
adoption, and inheritance, and brotherhood with the Only-Begotten, and
the supply of the Spirit, are acknowledged in this single title. For
one cannot call God Father, without having attained to all those
blessings. Doubly, therefore, doth He awaken their spirit, both by the
dignity of Him who is called on, and by the greatness of the benefits
which they have enjoyed. But when He saith, “in Heaven,” He
speaks not this as shutting up God there, but as withdrawing him who is
praying from earth, and fixing him in the high places, and in the
dwellings above.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p80">He teaches, moreover, to make our prayer common, in
behalf of our brethren also. For He saith not, “my Father, which
art in Heaven,” but, “our Father,” offering up his
supplications for the body in common, and nowhere looking to his own,
but everywhere to his neighbor’s good. And by this He at once
takes away hatred, and quells pride, and casts out envy, and brings in
the mother of all good things, even charity, and exterminates the
inequality of human things, and shows how far the equality reaches
between the king and the poor man, if at least in those things which
are greatest and most indispensable, we are all of us fellows. For what
harm comes of our kindred below, when in that which is on high we are
all of us knit together, and no one hath aught more than another;
neither the rich more than the poor, nor the master than the servant,
neither the ruler than the subject, nor the king than the common
soldier, nor the philosopher than the barbarian, nor the skillful than
the unlearned? For to all hath He given one nobility, having vouchsafed
to be called the Father of all alike.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p81">7. When therefore He hath reminded us of this nobility,
and of the gift from above, and of our equality with our brethren, and
of charity; and when He hath removed us from earth, and fixed us in
Heaven; let us see what He commands us to ask after this. Not but, in
the first place, even that saying alone is sufficient to implant
instruction in all virtue. For he who hath called God Father, and a
common Father, would be justly bound to show forth such a conversation,
as not to appear unworthy of this nobility, and to exhibit a diligence
proportionate to the gift. Yet is He not satisfied with this, but adds,
also another clause, thus saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p82">“Hallowed be Thy name.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p83">Worthy of him who calls God Father, is the prayer to ask
nothing before the glory of His Father, but to account all things
secondary to the work of praising Him. For “hallowed” is
<i>glorified</i>. For His own glory He hath complete, and ever
continuing the same, but He commands him who prays to seek that He may
be glorified also by our life. Which very thing He had said before
likewise, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven.”<note n="846" id="iii.XIX-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p84"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 16" id="iii.XIX-p84.1" parsed="|Matt|5|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.16">Matt. v.

“glorified.” That is, “vouchsafe,” saith he,
“that we may live so purely, that through us all may glorify
Thee.” Which thing again appertains unto perfect self-control, to
present to all a life so irreprehensible, that every one of the
beholders may offer to the Lord the praise due to Him for this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p88">And this again is the language of a right-minded child,
not to be rivetted to things that are seen, neither to account things
present some great matter; but to hasten unto our Father, and to long
for the things to come. And this springs out of a good conscience, and
a soul set free from things that are on earth. This, for instance, Paul
himself was longing after every day: wherefore he also said, that
“even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit,
groan, waiting for an adoption, the redemption of our body.”<note n="849" id="iii.XIX-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p89"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 23" id="iii.XIX-p89.1" parsed="|Rom|8|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.23">Rom. viii.

to come, and hasten towards that sojourn; and,
till that may be, even while we abide here, so long to be earnest in
showing forth the same conversation as those above. For ye must long,
saith He, for heaven, and the things in heaven; however, even before
heaven, He hath bidden us make the earth a heaven and do and say all
things, even while we are continuing in it, as having our conversation
there; insomuch that these too should be objects of our prayer to the
Lord. For there is nothing to hinder our reaching the perfection of the
powers above, because we inhabit the earth; but it is possible even
while abiding here, to do all, as though already placed on high. What
He saith therefore is this: “As there all things are done without
hindrance, and the angels are not partly obedient and partly
disobedient, but in all things yield and obey (for He saith,
‘Mighty in strength, performing His word’);<note n="852" id="iii.XIX-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p94"><scripRef passage="Ps. ciii. 20" id="iii.XIX-p94.1" parsed="|Ps|3|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.3.20">Ps. ciii.

things as Thou willest.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p95">Seest thou how He hath taught us also to be modest, by
making it clear that virtue is not of our endeavors only, but also of
the grace from above? And again, He hath enjoined each one of us, who
pray, to take upon himself the care of the whole world. For He did not
at all say, “Thy will be done” <i>in me,</i> or <i>in
us</i>, but everywhere on the earth; so that error may be destroyed,
and truth implanted, and all wickedness cast out, and virtue return,
and no difference in this respect be henceforth between heaven and
earth. “For if this come to pass,” saith He, “there
will be no difference between things below and above, separated as they
are in nature; the earth exhibiting to us another set of
angels.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p98">What is “<i>daily bread</i>”? That for one

on these passages. As all Biblical scholars are aware, the etymology
and meaning are still open to discussion. See Thayer’s <i>Greek
Lexicon, New Testament, sub voce</i>. The Fathers generally gave it a
spiritual or mystical sense, and Chrysostom’s position is,
therefore, the more important. The modern views may be inferred from
the R.V., which in the text of both renders the word
“daily,” with the margin “Greek, our bread for the
coming day,” but the American Company add as a second marginal
rendering, “our needful bread.” These two marginal
renderings represent two distinct etymologies, while
“daily” is an explanatory or inferential rendering, for
which the authority of Chrysostom has furnished strong
support.—R.]</p></note>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p100">For because He had said thus, “Thy will be done in
earth as it is in heaven,” but was discoursing to men encompassed
with flesh, and subject to the necessities of nature, and incapable of
the same impassibility with the angels:—while He enjoins the
commands to be practised by us also, even as they perform them; He
condescends likewise, in what follows, to the infirmity of our nature.
Thus, “perfection of conduct,” saith He, “I require
as great, not however freedom from passions; no, for the tyranny of
nature permits it not: for it requires necessary food.” But mark,
I pray thee, how even in things that are bodily, that which is
spiritual abounds. For it is neither for riches, nor for delicate
living, nor for costly raiment, nor for any other such thing, but for
bread only, that He hath commanded us to make our prayer. And for
“daily bread,” so as not to “take thought for the
morrow.”<note n="855" id="iii.XIX-p100.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p101"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 34" id="iii.XIX-p101.1" parsed="|Matt|6|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.34">Matt. vi.

bread for one day.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p102">And not even with this expression is He satisfied, but
adds another too afterwards, saying, “Give us <i>this
day</i>;” so that we may not, beyond this, wear ourselves out
with the care of the following day. For that day, the interval<note n="856" id="iii.XIX-p102.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p103"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p103.1">τ

thou submit to its cares?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p104">This, as He proceeded, he enjoined also more fully,
saying, “Take no thought for the morrow.” He would have us
be on every hand unencumbered and winged for flight, yielding just so
much to nature as the compulsion of necessity requires of us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p105">9. Then forasmuch as it comes to pass that we sin even
after the washing of regeneration, He, showing His love to man to be
great even in this case, commands us for the remission of our sins to
come unto God who loves man, and thus to say,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p106">“Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors.”<note n="857" id="iii.XIX-p106.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p107"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 12" id="iii.XIX-p107.1" parsed="|Matt|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.12">Matt. vi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p108">Seest thou surpassing mercy? After taking away so great
evils, and after the unspeakable greatness of His gift, if men sin
again, He counts them such as may be forgiven. For that this prayer
belongs to believers, is taught us both by the laws of the church, and
by the beginning of the prayer. For the uninitiated could not call God
Father. If then the prayer belongs to believers, and they pray,
entreating that sins may be forgiven them, it is clear that not even
after the laver is the profit of repentance taken away. Since, had He
not meant to signify this, He would not have made a law that we should
so pray. Now He who both brings sins to

remembrance, and bids us ask forgiveness, and teaches how
we may obtain remission and so makes the way easy; it is perfectly
clear that He introduced this rule of supplication, as knowing, and
signifying, that it is possible even after the font<note n="858" id="iii.XIX-p108.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p109">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p109.1">μετ τ

“after the laver.”—R.]</p></note>to wash ourselves from our offenses; by reminding us of our sins,
persuading us to be modest; by the command to forgive others, setting
us free from all revengeful passion; while by promising in return for
this to pardon us also, He holds out good hopes, and instructs us to
have high views<note n="859" id="iii.XIX-p109.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p110"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p110.1">φιλοσοφεν</span>.</p></note>concerning the unspeakable mercy of God toward man.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p111">But what we should most observe is this, that whereas in
each of the clauses He had made mention of the whole of virtue, and in
this way had included also the forgetfulness of injuries (for so, that
“His name be hallowed,” is the exactness of a perfect
conversation; and that “His will be done,” declares the
same thing again: and to be able to call God “Father,” is
the profession of a blameless life; in all which things had been
comprehended also the duty of remitting our anger against them that
have transgressed): still He was not satisfied with these, but meaning
to signify how earnest He is in the matter, He sets it down also in
particular, and after the prayer, He makes mention of no other
commandment than this, saying thus:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p112">“For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
heavenly Father also will forgive you.”<note n="860" id="iii.XIX-p112.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p113"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 14" id="iii.XIX-p113.1" parsed="|Matt|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.14">Matt. vi.
14</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p114">So that the beginning is of us, and we ourselves have
control over the judgment that is to be passed upon us. For in order
that no one, even of the senseless, might have any complaint to make,
either great or small, when brought to judgment; on thee, who art to
give account, He causes the sentence to depend; and “in what way
soever thou hast judged for thyself,<note n="861" id="iii.XIX-p114.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p115">Many <span class="c20" id="iii.XIX-p115.1">mss</span>. read <i>hast
given judgment on him</i>.</p></note>in the same,” saith He, “do I also judge thee.” And
if thou forgive thy fellow servant, thou shalt obtain the same favor
from me; though indeed the one be not equal to the other. For thou
forgivest in thy need, but God, having need of none: thou, thy fellow
slave; God, His slave: thou liable to unnumbered charges; God, being
without sin. But yet even thus doth He show forth His lovingkindness
towards man.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p116">Since He might indeed, even without this, forgive thee
all thine offenses; but He wills thee hereby also to receive a benefit;
affording thee on all sides innumerable occasions of gentleness and
love to man, casting out what is brutish in thee, and quenching wrath,
and in all ways cementing thee to him who is thine own member.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p117">For what canst thou have to say? that thou hast
wrongfully endured some ill of thy neighbor? (For these only are
trespasses, since if it be done with justice, the act is not a
trespass.) But thou too art drawing near to receive forgiveness for
such things, and for much greater. And even before the forgiveness,
thou hast received no small gift, in being taught to have a human soul,
and in being trained to all gentleness. And herewith a great reward
shall also be laid up for thee elsewhere, even to be called to account
for none of thine offenses.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p118">What sort of punishment then do we not deserve, when
after having received the privilege, we betray our salvation? And how
shall we claim to be heard in the rest of our matters, if we will not,
in those which depend on us, spare our own selves?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p119">10. “And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
us from the evil one: for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the

exceed his critical estimate of the Greek text of the New
Testament.—R.]</p></note>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p121">Here He teaches us plainly our own vileness, and quells
our pride, instructing us to deprecate all conflicts, instead of
rushing upon them. For so both our victory will be more glorious, and
the devil’s overthrow more to be derided. I mean, that as when we
are dragged forth, we must stand nobly; so when we are not summoned, we
should be quiet, and wait for the time of conflict; that we may show
both freedom from vainglory, and nobleness of spirit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p122">And He here calls the devil “the wicked
one,” commanding us to wage against him a war that knows no
truce, and implying that he is not such by nature. For wickedness<note n="863" id="iii.XIX-p122.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p123"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p123.1">πονηρα</span>.</p></note>is not of those things that are from nature, but of them that are added
by our own choice. And he is so called pre-eminently, by reason of the
excess of his wickedness, and because he, in no respect injured by us,
wages against us implacable war. Wherefore neither said He,
“deliver us from the wicked ones,” but, “from the
wicked one;” instructing us in no case to entertain displeasure
against our neighbors, for what wrongs soever we may suffer at their
hands, but to transfer our enmity from these to him, as being himself
the cause of all our wrongs.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p124">Having then made us anxious as before conflict, by
putting us in mind of the enemy, and having cut away from us all our
remissness; He again encourages and raises our spirits, by bringing to
our remembrance the King under whom we are arrayed, and signifying Him
to be more powerful than all. “For Thine,” saith He,
“is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p125">Doth it not then follow, that if His be the kingdom, we
should fear no one, since there can be none to withstand, and divide
the empire with him. For when He saith, “Thine is the
kingdom,” He sets before us even him, who is warring against us,
brought into subjection, though he seem to oppose, God for a while
permitting it. For in truth he too is among God’s servants,
though of the degraded class, and those guilty of offense; and he would
not dare set upon any of his fellow servants, had he not first received
license from above. And why say I, “his fellow servants?”

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p128">“And the power,” saith He. Therefore,
manifold as thy weakness may be, thou mayest of right be confident,
having such a one to reign over thee, who is able fully to accomplish
all, and that with ease, even by thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p129">“And the glory, for ever. Amen.” Thus He not
only frees thee from the dangers that are approaching thee, but can
make thee also glorious and illustrious. For as His power is great, so
also is His glory unspeakable, and they are all boundless, and no end
of them. Seest thou how He hath by every means anointed His Champion,
and hath framed Him to be full of confidence?</p>

all things He most loathes and hates bearing malice, and most of all

by the punishment set, and by the reward appointed, urging the hearer

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p133">With this view He hath again mentioned heaven also, and

children, but also by our works. And nothing makes us so like God, as
being ready to forgive the wicked and wrong-doers; even as indeed He
had taught before, when He spake of His “making the sun to shine
on the evil and on the good.”<note n="868" id="iii.XIX-p134.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p135"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 45" id="iii.XIX-p135.1" parsed="|Matt|5|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.45">Matt. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p136">For this same cause again in every one of the clauses He
commands us to make our prayers common, saying, “Our
Father,” and “Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven,” and “Give <i>us</i> the bread, and forgive
<i>us</i> our debts,” and “lead <i>us</i> not into
temptation,” and “deliver <i>us</i>;” everywhere
commanding us to use this plural word, that we may not retain so much
as a vestige of anger against our neighbor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p137">How great punishment then must they deserve, who after
all this, so far from themselves forgiving, do even entreat God for
vengeance on their enemies, and diametrically as it were transgress
this law; and this while He is doing and contriving all, to hinder our
being at variance one with another? For since love is the root of all
that is good, He removing from all sides whatever mars it, brings us
together, and cements us to each other. For there is not, there is not
one, be he father, or mother, or friend, or what you will, who so loved
us as the God who created us. And this, above all things, both His
daily benefits and His precepts make manifest. But if thou tell me of
the pains, and of the sorrows, and of the evils of life; consider in
how many things thou offendest Him every day, and thou wilt no longer
marvel, though more than these evils should come upon thee, but if thou
shouldest enjoy any good, then thou wilt marvel, and be amazed. But as
it is, we look upon the calamities that come upon us, but the offenses,
whereby we offend daily, we consider not: therefore we are perplexed.
Since if we did but reckon up with strictness our sins of one day only,
in that case we should know well how great evils we must be liable
to.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p138">And to let pass the other misdoings of which we have
been guilty, each one for himself, and to speak of what have been
committed this day; although of course I know not in what each of us
may have sinned, yet such is the abundance of our misdoings, that

<pb n="135" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_135.html" id="iii.XIX-Page_135" />

not even he who knew all exactly would be
able to choose from among these only. Which of us, for instance, hath
not been careless in his prayers? Which hath not been insolent, or
vainglorious? Who hath not spoken evil of his brother, hath not
admitted a wicked desire, hath not looked with unchaste eyes, hath not
remembered things with hostile feeling, even till he made his heart
swell?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p139">And if while we are in church, and in a short time we
have become guilty of so great evils; what shall be when we are gone
out from hence? If in the harbor the waves are so high, when we are
gone forth into the channel of wickednesses, the forum I mean, and to
public business, and our cares at home, shall we indeed be able so much
as to know ourselves again?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p140">But yet from our so great and so many sins, God hath
given us a short and easy way of deliverance, and one that is free from
all toil. For what sort of toil is it to forgive him that hath grieved
us? Nay, it is a toil not to forgive, but to keep up our enmity: even
as to be delivered from the anger, both works in us a great
refreshment, and is very easy to him that is willing. For there is no
sea to be crossed, nor long journey to be travelled, nor summits of
mountains to be passed over, nor money to be spent, no need to torment
thy body; but it suffices to be willing only, and all our sins are done
away.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p141">But if so far from forgiving him thyself, thou makest
intercession to God against him, what hope of salvation wilt thou then
have, if at the very time when thou oughtest rather to appease God,
even then thou provokest Him; putting on the garb of a suppliant, but
uttering the cries of a wild beast, and darting out against thyself
those shafts of the wicked one? Wherefore Paul also, making mention of
prayer, required nothing so much as the observance of this commandment;
for He saith, “lifting up holy hands without wrath and
doubting.”<note n="869" id="iii.XIX-p141.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p142"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 8" id="iii.XIX-p142.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.8">1 Tim. ii.
8</scripRef>. [R.V.,
“disputing,” with margin,
“doubting.”—R.]</p></note> And if when thou hast need of mercy, not even then wilt thou let go
thine anger, but art rather exceedingly mindful of it, and that,
although thou knowest thou art thrusting the sword into thyself; when
will it be possible for thee to become merciful, and to spew out the
evil venom of this wickedness?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p143">But if thou hast not yet seen this outrageousness in its
full extent, suppose it happening among men, and then thou wilt
perceive the excess of the insolence. As thus: should one approach thee
who are a man, seeking to obtain mercy, and then, in the midst of his
lying on the ground, should see an enemy, and leaving off to supplicate
thee, begin to beat him; wouldest thou not make thyself more angry with
him? This do thou consider as taking place with regard to God also. For
so thou likewise, making supplication unto God, leavest thy
supplication in the midst, and smitest thine enemy with thy words, and
insultest the laws of God. Him who made a law to dismiss all anger,
thou art summoning against those that have vexed thee, and requiring
Him to do things contrary to His own commandments. Is it not enough for
thee in the way of revenge, that thou thyself transgressest the law of
God, but entreatest thou Him likewise to do so? What? hath He forgotten
what He commanded? What? is He a man who spake these things? It is God,
who knows all things, and whose will is, that His own laws be kept with
the utmost exactness, and who, so far from doing these things which
thou art requiring of Him, doth even regard thee who sayest these
things, merely because thou sayest them, with aversion and hatred, and
exacts of thee the most extreme penalty. How then seekest thou to
obtain of Him things, from which He very seriously bids thee
refrain?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p144">Yet some there are, who have come to such a point of
brutishness, as not only to make intercession against their enemies,
but even to curse their children, and to taste, if only it might be, of
their very flesh; or rather they are even tasting thereof. For tell me
not this, that thou hast not fixed thy teeth in the body of him that
vexed thee; since thou hast done, at least as far as concerned thee,
what is much more grievous; in claiming that wrath from above should
fall upon him, and that he should be delivered over to undying
punishment, and be overthrown with his whole house.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p145">Why, what sort of bites are as ferocious as this? what
kind of weapons as bitter? Not so did Christ instruct thee; not so did
He command thee to stain thy mouth with blood. Nay, mouths made bloody
with human flesh are not so shocking as tongues like these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p146">How then wilt thou salute thy brother? how wilt thou
touch the sacrifice? how taste the Lord’s blood, when thou hast
so much venom upon thy mind? Since when thou sayest, “Rend him in
pieces, and overthrow his house, and destroy all,” when thou art
imprecating on him ten thousand deaths, thou art in nothing different
from a murderer, or rather from a wild beast that devours men.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p147">Let us cease then from this disease and madness, and
that kindliness which He com

manded
let us show forth towards them that have vexed us: that we may become
like “our Father which is in heaven.” And we shall cease
therefrom, if we call to mind our own sins; if we strictly search out
all our misdeeds at home, abroad, and in the market, and in church.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p148">12. For if for nothing else, surely for our
disrespectfulness here we are worthy to undergo the utmost punishment.
For when prophets are chanting, and apostles singing hymns, and God is
discoursing, we wander without, and bring in upon us a turmoil of
worldly business. And we do not afford to the laws of God so great
stillness, even as the spectators in the theatres to the
emperor’s letters, keeping silence for them. For there, when
these letters are being read, deputies at once, and governors, and
senate, and people, stand all upright, with quietness hearkening to the
words. And if amid that most profound silence any one should suddenly
leap up and cry out, he suffers the utmost punishment, as having been
insolent to the emperor. But here, when the letters from heaven are
being read, great is the confusion on all sides. And yet both He who
sent the letters is much greater than this our king,<note n="870" id="iii.XIX-p148.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p149">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p149.1">το

tidings, are much more awful than those on earth. Wherefore not men
only, but angels also and archangels; both the nations of heaven, and

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p163">Yet, nevertheless, while both these and many more
sayings than these are being uttered, while we ought to tremble, and
not so much as account ourselves to be on the earth; still, as though
in the midst of a forum, we make an uproar and disturbance, and spend
the whole time of our solemn assembly<note n="882" id="iii.XIX-p163.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XIX-p164"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XIX-p164.1">τ

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p165">When therefore both in little things, and in great, both
in hearing, and in doing, both abroad, and at home, in the church, we
are so negligent; and together with all this, pray also against our
enemies: whence are we to have any hope of salvation, adding to so
great sins yet another grievous enhancement, and equivalent to them
all, even this unlawful prayer?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p166">Have we then hereafter any right to marvel, if aught
befall us of the things which are unexpected and painful? whereas we
ought to marvel when no such thing befalls us. For the former is in the
natural order of things, but the latter were beyond all reason and
expectation. For surely it is beyond reason, that they who are become
enemies of God, and are provoking Him to anger, should enjoy sunshine
and showers, and all the rest; who being men surpass the barbarity of
wild beasts, setting themselves one against another, and by the biting
of their neighbors staining their own tongues with blood: after the
spiritual table, and His so great benefits, and His innumerable
injunctions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p167">Therefore, considering these things, let us cast up that
venom; let us put an end to our enmities, and let us make the prayers
that become such as we are. Instead of the brutality of devils, let us
take upon us the mildness of angels; and in whatsoever things we may
have been injured, let us, consider

ing our own case, and the reward appointed us
for this commandment, soften our anger; let us assuage the billows,
that we may both pass through the present life calmly, and when we have
departed thither, may find our Lord such as we have been towards our
fellow-servants. And if this be a heavy and fearful thing, let us make
it light and desirable; and let us open the glorious gates of
confidence towards Him; and what we had not strength to effect by
abstaining from sin, that let us accomplish by becoming gentle to them
who have sinned against us (for this surely is not grievous, nor
burdensome); and let us by doing kindnesses to our enemies, lay up
beforehand much mercy for ourselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XIX-p168">For so both during this present life all will love us,
and above all others, God will both befriend and crown us, and will
count us worthy of all the good things to come; unto which may we all
attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.XX-p4">“And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a
sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces, that they may appear
unto men to fast.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XX-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XX-p5.1">Here</span> it were well to sigh
aloud, and to wail bitterly: for not only do we imitate the hypocrites,
but we have even surpassed them. For I know, yea I know many, not
merely fasting and making a display of it, but neglecting to fast, and
yet wearing the masks of them that fast, and cloaking themselves with
an excuse worse than their sin.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p6">For “I do this,” say they, “that I may
not offend the many.” What sayest thou? There is a law of God
which commands these things, and dost thou talk of offense? And
thinkest thou that in keeping it thou art offending, in transgressing
it, delivering men from offense? And what can be worse than this
folly?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p7">Wilt thou not leave off becoming worse than the very
hypocrites, and making thine hypocrisy double? And when thou
considerest the great excess of this evil, wilt thou not be abashed at
the force of the expression now before us? In that He did not say,
“they act a part,” merely, but willing also to touch them
more deeply, He saith, “For they disfigure their faces;”
that is, they corrupt, they mar them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p8">But if this be a disfiguring of the face, to appear pale
for vainglory, what should we say concerning the women who corrupt
their faces with colorings and paintings to the ruin of the unchaste
sort of young men? For while those harm themselves only, these women
harm both themselves and them who behold them. Wherefore we should fly
both from the one pest and from the other, keeping at distance enough
and to spare. For so He not only commanded to make no display, but even
to seek to be concealed. Which thing He had done before likewise.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p9">And whereas in the matter of almsgiving, He did not put
it simply, but having said, “Take heed not to do it before
men,” He added, “to be seen of them;” yet concerning
fasting and prayer, He made no such limitation. Why could this have
been? Because for almsgiving to be altogether concealed is impossible,
but for prayer and fasting, it is possible.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p10">As therefore, when He said, “Let not thy left hand
know what thy right hand doeth,” it was not of hands that He was
speaking, but of the duty of being strictly concealed from all; and as
when He commanded us to enter into our closet, not there alone
absolutely, nor there primarily, did He command us to pray, but He
covertly intimated the same thing again; so likewise here, in
commanding us “to be anointed,” He did not enact that we
positively must anoint ourselves; for then we should all of us be found
transgressors of this law; and above all, surely, they who have taken
the most pains

to keep it, the
societies of the monks, who have taken up their dwelling on the
mountains. It was not this then that He enjoined, but, forasmuch as the
ancients had a custom to anoint themselves continually, when they were
taking their pleasure and rejoicing (and this one may see clearly from
David<note n="884" id="iii.XX-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p11"><scripRef passage="2 Sam. xii. 20" id="iii.XX-p11.1" parsed="|2Sam|12|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.12.20">2 Sam. xii.

3</scripRef>.</p></note> He said that we were to anoint ourselves, not that we should positively
do this, but that by all means we might endeavor, with great
strictness, to hide this our acquisition. And to convince thee that so
it is, He Himself, when by action exhibiting what He enjoined in words,
having fasted forty days, and fasted in secret, did neither anoint nor
wash Himself: nevertheless, though He did not these things, He most
assuredly fulfilled the whole without vainglory. It is this then that
He enjoins on us likewise, both bringing before us the hypocrites, and
by a twice repeated charge dissuading the hearers.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p13">And somewhat else He signified by this name, this of
hypocrites,<note n="886" id="iii.XX-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p14">Literally, “actors.”</p></note> I mean. That is, not only by the ridiculousness of the thing, nor by
its bringing an extreme penalty, but also by showing that such deceit
is but for a season, doth He withdraw us from that evil desire. For the
actor seems glorious just so long as the audience is sitting; or rather
not even then in the sight of all. For the more part of the spectators
know who it is, and what part he is acting. However, when the audience
is broken up, he is more clearly discovered to all. Now this, you see,
the vainglorious must in all necessity undergo. For even here they are
manifest to the majority, as not being that which they appear to be,
but as wearing a mask only; but much more will they be detected
hereafter, when all things appear “naked and open.”<note n="887" id="iii.XX-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p15"><scripRef passage="Heb. iv. 13" id="iii.XX-p15.1" parsed="|Heb|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.4.13">Heb. iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p16">And by another motive again He withdraws them from the
hypocrites, by showing that His injunction is light. For He doth not
make the fast more strict, nor command us to practise more of it, but
not to lose the crown thereof. So that what seems hard to bear, is
common to us and to the hypocrites, for they also fast; but that which
is lightest, namely, not to lose the reward after our labors,
“this is what I command,” saith He; adding nothing to our
toils, but gathering our wages for us with all security, and not
suffering us to go away unrewarded, as they do. Nay, they will not so
much as imitate them that wrestle in the Olympic games, who although so
great a multitude is sitting there, and so many princes, desire to
please but one, even him who adjudges the victory amongst them; and
this, though he be much their inferior. But thou, though thou hast a
twofold motive for displaying the victory to Him, first, that He is the
person to adjudge it, and also, that He is beyond comparison superior
to all that are sitting in the theatre,—thou art displaying it to
others, who so far from profiting, do privily work thee the greatest
harm.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p17">However, I do not forbid even this, saith He. Only, if
thou art desirous to make a show to men, also, wait, and I will bestow
on thee this too in fuller abundance, and with great profit. For as it
is, this quite breaks thee off from the glory which is with me, even as
to despise these things unites thee closely; but then shalt thou enjoy
all in entire security; having, even before that last, no little fruit
to reap in this world also, namely, that thou hast trodden under foot
all human glory, and art freed from the grievous bondage of men, and
art become a true worker of virtue. Whereas now, as long at least as
thou art so disposed, if thou shouldest be in a desert, thou wilt be
deserted by all thy virtue, having none to behold thee. This is to act
as one insulting virtue itself, if thou art to pursue it not for its
own sake, but with an eye to the ropemaker, and the brazier, and the
common people of the baser sort, that the bad and they that are far
removed from virtue may admire thee. And thou art calling the enemies
of virtue to the display and the sight thereof, as if one were to
choose to live continently, not for the excellency of continence, but
that he might make a show before prostitutes. Thou also, it would seem,
wouldest not choose virtue, but for the sake of virtue’s enemies;
whereas thou oughtest indeed to admire her on this very ground, that
she hath even her enemies to praise her,—yet to admire her (as is
meet), not for others, but for her own sake. Since we too, when we are
loved not for our own, but for others’ sake, account the thing an
insult. Just so I bid thee reckon in the case of virtue as well, and
neither to follow after her for the sake of others, nor for men’s
sake to obey God; but men for God’s sake. Since if thou do the
contrary, though thou seem to follow virtue, thou hast provoked equally
with him who follows her not. For just as he disobeyed by not doing, so
thou by doing unlawfully.</p>

of vainglory, and not before, He seasonably
introduces His discourse of voluntary poverty.<note n="889" id="iii.XX-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p21"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XX-p21.1">ἀκτημοσυν</span>.</p></note> For nothing so trains men to be fond of riches, as the fondness for
glory. This, for instance, is why men devise those herds of slaves, and
that swarm of eunuchs, and their horses with trappings of gold, and
their silver tables, and all the rest of it, yet more ridiculous; not
to satisfy any wants, nor to enjoy any pleasure, but that they may make
a show before the multitude.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p22">Now above He had only said, that we must show mercy; but
here He points out also how great mercy we must show, when He saith,
“Lay not up treasure.” For it not being possible at the
beginning to introduce all at once His discourse on contempt of riches,
by reason of the tyranny of the passion, He breaks it up into small
portions, and having set free the hearer’s mind, instills it
therein, so as that it shall become acceptable. Wherefore, you see, He
said first, “Blessed are the merciful;” and after this,
“Agree with thine adversary;” and after that again,
“If any one will sue thee at the law and take thy coat, give him
thy cloak also;” but here, that which is much greater than all
these. For there His meaning was, “if thou see a law-suit
impending, do this; since to want and be freed from strife, is better
than to possess and strive;” but here, supposing neither
adversary nor any one at law with thee, and without all mention of any
other such party, He teaches the contempt of riches itself by itself,
implying that not so much for their sake who receive mercy, as for the
giver’s sake, He makes these laws: so that though there be no one
injuring us, or dragging us into a court of justice, even so we may
despise our possessions, bestowing them on those that are in need.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p23">And neither here hath He put the whole, but even in this
place it is gently spoken; although He had in the wilderness shown
forth to a surpassing extent His conflicts in that behalf.<note n="890" id="iii.XX-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 9, 10" id="iii.XX-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|4|9|4|10" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.9-Matt.4.10">Matt. iv.
9, 10</scripRef>.</p></note> However He doth not express this, nor bring it forward; for it was not
yet time to reveal it; but for a while He searches out for reasons,
maintaining the place of an adviser rather than a lawgiver, in His
sayings on this subject.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p25">For after He had said, “Lay not up treasures upon
the earth,” He added, “where moth and rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves break through and steal.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p26">For the present He signifies the hurtfulness of the
treasure here, and the profit of what is there, both from the place,
and from the things which mar it. And neither at this point doth He
stop, but adds also another argument.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p27">And first, what things they most fear, from these He
urges them. For “of what art thou afraid?” saith He:
“lest thy goods should be spent, if thou give alms? Nay, then
give alms, and so they will not be spent; and, what is more, so far
from being spent, they will actually receive a greater increase; yea,
for the things in heaven are added unto them.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p28">However, for a time He saith it not, but puts it
afterwards. But for the present, what had most power to persuade them,
that He brings forward, namely, that the treasure would thus remain for
them unspent.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p29">And on either hand He attracts them. For He said not
only, “If thou give alms, it is preserved:” but He
threatened also the opposite thing, that if thou give not, it
perishes.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p30">And see His unspeakable prudence. For neither did He
say, “Thou dost but leave them to others;” since this too
is pleasant to men: He alarms them however on a new ground, by
signifying that not even this do they obtain: since though men defraud
not, there are those which are sure to defraud, “the moth”
and “the rust.” For although this mischief seem very easy
to restrain, it is nevertheless irresistible and uncontrollable, and
devise what thou wilt, thou wilt be unable to check this harm.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p31">“What then, doth moth<note n="891" id="iii.XX-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p32">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XX-p32.1">σ</span>. The Oxford Version

Though not all, yet the more part.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p34">3. On this account then He adds another argument, which
I have already mentioned, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p35">“Where the man’s treasure is, there is his
heart also.”<note n="893" id="iii.XX-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p36"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 21" id="iii.XX-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|6|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.21">Matt. vi.

treasure is, there will thy heart be also” (R.V.), but Chrysostom
varies from this both here and below. The plural form has little
authority.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p37">For though none of these things should come to pass,
saith He, thou wilt undergo no small harm, in being nailed to the
things below, and in becoming a slave instead of a freeman, and casting
thyself out of the heavenly things, and having no power to think on
aught that is high, but all about money, usuries and loans, and gains,
and ignoble traffickings. Than this what could be more wretched? For in
truth such an one will be worse off than any slave, bringing upon
himself a most grievous tyranny, and giving up

<pb n="140" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_140.html" id="iii.XX-Page_140" />

the chiefest thing of all, even the nobleness
and the liberty of man. For how much soever any one may discourse unto
thee, thou wilt not be able to hear any of those things which concern
thee, whilst thy mind is nailed down to money; but bound like a dog to
a tomb, by the tyranny of riches, more grievously than by any chain,
barking at all that come near thee, thou hast this one employment
continually, to keep for others what thou hast laid up. Than this what
can be more wretched?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p38">However, forasmuch as this was too high for the mind of
His hearers, and neither was the mischief within easy view of the
generality, nor the gain evident, but there was need of a spirit of
more self-command to perceive either of these; first, He hath put it
after those other topics, which are obvious, saying, “Where the
man’s treasure is, there is his heart also;” and next He
makes it clear again, by withdrawing His discourse from the
intellectual to the sensible, and saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p39">“The light of the body is the eye.”<note n="894" id="iii.XX-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 22" id="iii.XX-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|6|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.22">Matt. vi.
22</scripRef>. [R.V., “The lamp of
the body,” etc.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p41">What He saith is like this: Bury not gold in the earth,
nor do any other such thing, for thou dost but gather it for the moth,
and the rust, and the thieves. And even if thou shouldest entirely
escape these evils, yet the enslaving of thine heart, the nailing it to
all that is below, thou wilt not escape: “For wheresoever thy
treasure may be, there is thine heart also.” As then, laying up
stores in heaven, thou wilt reap not this fruit only, the attainment of
the rewards for these things, but from this world thou already
receivest thy recompence, in getting into harbor there, in setting
thine affections on the things that are there, and caring for what is
there (for where thou hast laid up thy treasures, it is most clear thou
transferrest thy mind also); so if thou do this upon earth, thou wilt
experience the contrary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p42">But if the saying be obscure to thee, hear what comes
next in order. “The light of the body is the eye; if therefore
thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if
thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. But if the
light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the
darkness!”<note n="895" id="iii.XX-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 22, 23" id="iii.XX-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|6|22|6|23" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.22-Matt.6.23">Matt. vi.

correct reading, and some <span class="c20" id="iii.XX-p43.3">mss</span>. of the Homilies
have this reading here.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p44">He leads His discourse to the things which are more
within the reach of our senses. I mean, forasmuch as He had spoken of
the mind as enslaved and brought into captivity, and there were not
many who could easily discern this, He transfers the lesson to things
outward, and lying before men’s eyes, that by these the others
also might reach their understanding. Thus, “If thou knowest
not,” saith He, “what a thing it is to be injured in mind,
learn it from the things of the body; for just what the eye is to the
body, the same is the mind to the soul.” As therefore thou
wouldest not choose to wear gold, and to be clad in silken garments,
thine eyes withal being put out, but accountest their sound health more
desirable than all such superfluity (for, shouldest thou lose this
health or waste it, all thy life besides will do thee no good): for
just as when the eyes are blinded, most of the energy of the other
members is gone, their light being quenched; so also when the mind is
depraved, thy life will be filled with countless evils:<note n="896" id="iii.XX-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p45">[In the Greek text, the parenthesis extends to this
place.—R.]</p></note>—as therefore in the body this is our aim, namely, to keep the
eye sound, so also the mind in the soul. But if we mutilate this, which
ought to give light to the rest, by what means are we to see clearly
any more? For as he that destroys the fountain, dries up also the
river, so he who hath quenched the understanding hath confounded all
his doings in this life. Wherefore He saith, “If the light that
is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p46">For when the pilot is drowned, and the candle is put
out, and the general is taken prisoner; what sort of hope will there
be, after that, for those that are under command?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p47">Thus then, omitting now to speak of the plots to which
wealth gives occasion, the strifes, the suits (these indeed He had
signified above, when He said, “The adversary shall deliver thee
to the judge, and the judge to the officer”); and setting down
what is more grievous than all these, as sure to occur, He so withdraws
us from the wicked desire. For to inhabit the prison is not nearly so
grievous, as for the mind to be enslaved by this disease; and the
former is not sure to happen, but the other is connected as an
immediate consequent with the desire of riches. And this is why He puts
it after the first, as being a more grievous thing, and sure to
happen.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p48">For God, He saith, gave us understanding, that we might
chase away all ignorance, and have the right judgment of things, and
that using this as a kind of weapon and light against all that is
grievous or hurtful, we might remain in safety. But we betray the gift
for the sake of things superfluous and useless.</p>

<pb n="141" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_141.html" id="iii.XX-Page_141" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p49">For what is the use of soldiers arrayed in gold, when
the general is dragged along a captive? what the profit of a ship
beautifully equipped, when the pilot is sunk beneath the waves? what
the advantage of a well-proportioned body, when the sight of the eyes
is stricken out? As therefore, should any one cast into sickness the
physician (who should be in good health, that he may end our diseases),
and then bid him lie on a silver couch, and in a chamber of gold, this
will nothing avail the sick persons; even so, if thou corrupt the mind
(which hath power to put down our passions),<note n="897" id="iii.XX-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p50">[These clauses are not parenthetical, but in the
Greek define what precedes.—R.]</p></note>although thou set it by a treasure, so far from doing it any good, thou
hast inflicted the very greatest loss, and hast harmed thy whole
soul.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p51">4. Seest thou how by those very things, through which
most especially men everywhere affect wickedness, even by these most of
all He deters them from it, and brings them back to virtue? “For
with what intent dost thou desire riches?” saith He; “is it
not that thou mayest enjoy pleasure and luxury? Why now, this above all
things thou wilt fail to obtain thereby, it will rather be just
contrary.” For if, when our eyes are stricken out, we perceive
not any pleasant thing, because of such our calamity; much more will
this be our case in the perversion and maiming of the mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p52">Again, with what intent dost thou bury it in the earth?
That it may be kept in safety? But here too again it is the contrary,
saith He.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p53">And thus, as in dealing with him that for vainglory
fasts and gives alms and prays, by those very things which he most
desires He had allured him not to be vainglorious:—“for
with what intent,” saith He, “dost thou so pray and give
alms? for love of the glory that may be had from men? then do not pray
thus,” saith He, “and so thou shalt obtain it in the day
that is to come:”—so He hath taken captive the covetous man
also, by those things for which he was most earnest. Thus: “what
wouldest thou?” saith He, “to have thy wealth preserved,
and to enjoy pleasure? Both these things I will afford thee in great
abundance, if thou lay up thy gold in that place, where I bid
thee.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p54">It is true that hereafter He displayed more clearly the
evil effect of this on the mind, I mean, when He made mention of the
thorns;<note n="898" id="iii.XX-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p55"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 22" id="iii.XX-p55.1" parsed="|Matt|13|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.22">Matt. xiii.
22</scripRef>.</p></note>but for the present, even here He hath strikingly intimated<note n="899" id="iii.XX-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p56">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XX-p56.1">οχ
τυχε</span>.]</p></note>the same, by representing him as darkened who is beside himself in this
way.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p57">And as they that are in darkness see nothing distinct,
but if they look at a rope, they suppose it to be a serpent, if at
mountains and ravines, they are dead with fear; so these also: what is
not alarming to them that have sight, that they regard with suspicion.
Thus among other things they tremble at poverty: or rather not at
poverty only, but even at any trifling loss. Yea, and if they should
lose some little matter, those who are in want of necessary food do not
so grieve and bewail themselves as they. At least many of the rich have
come even to the halter, not enduring such ill fortune: and to be
insulted also, and to be despitefully used, seems to them so
intolerable, that even because of this again many have actually torn
themselves from this present life. For to everything wealth had made
them soft, except to the waiting on it. Thus, when it commands them to
do service unto itself, they venture on murders, and stripes, and
revilings, and all shame. A thing which comes of the utmost
wretchedness; to be of all men most effeminate, where one ought to
practise self-command, but where more caution was required, in these
cases again to become more shameless and obstinate. Since in fact the
same kind of thing befalls them, as one would have to endure who had
spent all his goods on unfit objects. For such an one, when the time of
necessary expenditure comes on, having nothing to supply it, suffers
incurable evils, forasmuch as all that he had hath been ill spent
beforehand.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p58">And as they that are on the stage, skilled in those
wicked arts, do in them go through many things strange and dangerous,
but in other necessary and useful things none so ridiculous as they;
even so is it with these men likewise. For so such as walk upon a
stretched rope, making a display of so much courage, should some great
emergency demand daring or courage, they are not able, neither do they
endure even to think of such a thing. Just so they likewise that are
rich, daring all for money, for self-restraint’s sake endure not
to submit to anything, be it small or great. And as the former practise
both a hazardous and fruitless business; even so do these undergo many
dangers and downfalls, but arrive at no profitable end. Yea, they
undergo a twofold darkness, both having their eyes put out by the
perversion of their mind, and being by the deceitfulness of their cares
involved in a great mist. Wherefore neither can they easily so much as
see through it. For he that is in darkness, is

<pb n="142" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_142.html" id="iii.XX-Page_142" />

freed from the darkness by the mere appearance of the sun;
but he that hath his eyes mutilated not even when the sun shines; which
is the very case of these men: not even now that the Sun of
Righteousness hath shone out, and is admonishing, do they hear, their
wealth having closed their eyes. And so they have a twofold darkness to
undergo, part from themselves, part from disregard to their
teacher.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p59">5. Let us then give heed unto Him exactly, that though
late we may at length recover our sight. And how may one recover sight?
If thou learn how thou wast blinded. How then wast thou blinded? By thy
wicked desire. For the love of money, like an evil humor<note n="900" id="iii.XX-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p60"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XX-p60.1">χυμ</span>.</p></note>which hath collected upon a clear eyeball, hath caused the cloud to
become thick.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p61">But even this cloud may be easily scattered and broken,
if we will receive the beam of the doctrine of Christ; if we will hear
Him admonishing us, and saying, “Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earth.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p62">“But,” saith one, “what avails the
hearing to me, as long as I am possessed by the desire?” Now in
the first place, there will be power in the continual hearing to
destroy even the desire. Next, if it continue to possess thee, consider
that this thing is not really so much as a desire. For what sort of
desire is this, to be in grievous bondage, and to be subject to a
tyranny, and to be bound on all sides, and to dwell in darkness, and to
be full of turmoil, and to endure toils without profit, and to keep thy
wealth for others, and often for thy very enemies? with what sort of
desire do these things agree? or rather of what flight and aversion are
they not worthy? What sort of desire, to lay up treasure in the midst
of thieves? Nay, if thou dost at all desire wealth, remove it where it
may remain safe and unmolested. Since what you are now doing is the
part of one desiring, not riches, surely, but bondage, and
affront,<note n="901" id="iii.XX-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p63"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XX-p63.1">ἐπηρεα</span>.</p></note>and loss, and continual vexation. Yet thou, were any one among men on
earth to show thee a place beyond molestation, though he lead thee out
into the very desert, promising security in the keeping of thy
wealth,—thou art not slow nor backward; thou hast confidence in
him, and puttest out thy goods there; but when it is God instead of men
who makes thee this promise, and when He sets before thee not the
desert, but Heaven, thou acceptest the contrary. Yet surely, how
manifold soever be their security below, thou canst never become free
from the care of them. I mean, though thou lose them not, thou wilt
never be delivered from anxiety lest thou lose. But there thou wilt
undergo none of these things: and mark, what is yet more, thou dost not
only bury thy gold, but plantest it. For the same is both treasure and
seed; or rather it is more than either of these. For the seed remains
not for ever, but this abides perpetually. Again, the treasure
germinates not, but this bears thee fruits which never die.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p64">6. But if thou tellest me of the time, and the delay of
the recompence, I too can point out and tell how much thou receivest
back even here: and besides all this, from the very things of this
life, I will try to convict thee of making this excuse to no purpose. I
mean, that even in the present life thou providest many things which
thou art not thyself to enjoy; and should any one find fault, thou
pleadest thy children and their children, and so thinkest thou hast
found palliation enough for thy superfluous labors. For when in extreme
old age thou art building splendid houses, before the completion of
which (in many instances) thou wilt have departed; when thou plantest
trees, which will bear their fruit after many years;<note n="902" id="iii.XX-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p65">[In the Greek text, bracketted by Field, and in the

which thou wilt acquire after a long time, and art eagerly busy in many
other such things, the enjoyment whereof thou wilt not reap; is it
indeed for thine own sake, or for those to come after, that thou art so
employed? How then is it not the utmost folly, here not at all to
hesitate<note n="903" id="iii.XX-p65.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XX-p66"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XX-p66.1">ἀλειν</span>.</p></note>at the delay of time; and this though thou art by this delay to lose

and although it convey not thy good things on to others, but procure
the gifts for thyself.</p>

those things are at the doors, and we know not but that even in our own
generation all things which concern us may have their accomplishment,
and that fearful day may arrive, setting before us the awful and
incorruptible tribunal. Yea, for the more part of the signs are
fulfilled, and the gospel moreover hath been preached in all parts of
the world, and the predictions of wars, and of earthquakes, and of
famines, have come to pass, and the interval is not great.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XX-p68">But is it that thou dost not see any signs? Why, this
self-same thing is a very great sign. For neither did they in
Noah’s time see any presages of that universal destruction, but
in the midst of their playing, eating, marrying, doing all things to
which they were used, even so they were overtaken by that fearful
judgment. And they too in Sodom in like manner, living in delight, and
suspecting none of what befell them, were consumed by those lightnings,
which then came down upon them.</p>

ourselves unto the preparation for our departure hence.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.XXI-p3">“No man can serve two masters, for either he will
hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to one and
despise the other.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XXI-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXI-p4.1">Seest</span> thou how by degrees He
withdraws us from the things that now are, and at greater length
introduces what He hath to say, touching voluntary poverty, and casts
down the dominion of covetousness?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p5">For He was not contented with His former sayings, many
and great as they were, but He adds others also, more and more
alarming.<note n="906" id="iii.XXI-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p6">[“More in number and more
terrible.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p7">For what can be more alarming than what He now saith, if
indeed we are for our riches to fall from the service of Christ? or
what more to be desired, if indeed, by despising wealth, we shall have
our affection towards Him and our charity perfect?<note n="907" id="iii.XXI-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p8">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p8.1">ἀκριβ</span>.]</p></note> For what I am continually repeating, the same do I now say likewise,
namely, that by both kinds He presses the hearer to obey His sayings;
both by the profitable, and by the hurtful; much like an excellent
physician, pointing out both the disease which is the consequence of
neglect, and the good health which results from obedience.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p9">See, for instance, what kind of gain He signifies this
to be, and how He establishes the advantage of it by their deliverance
from the contrary things. Thus, “wealth,” saith He,
“hurts you not in this only, that it arms robbers against you,
nor in that it darkens your mind in the most intense degree, but also
in that it casts you out of God’s service, making you captive of
lifeless riches, and in both ways doing you harm, on the one hand, by
causing you to be slaves of what you ought to command; on the other, by
casting you out of God’s service, whom, above all things, it is
indispensable for you to serve.” For just as in the other place,
He signified the mischief to be twofold, in both laying up here,
“where moth corrupteth,” and in not laying up there, where
the watch kept is impregnable; so in this place, too, He shows the loss
to be twofold, in that it both draws off from God, and makes us subject
to mammon.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p10">But He sets it not down directly, rather He establishes
it first upon general considerations, saying thus; “No man can
serve two masters:” meaning here two that are enjoining opposite
things; since, unless this were the case, they would not even be two.
For so, “the multitude of them that believed

<pb n="144" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_144.html" id="iii.XXI-Page_144" />

were of one heart and of one soul,”<note n="908" id="iii.XXI-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p11"><scripRef passage="Acts iv. 32" id="iii.XXI-p11.1" parsed="|Acts|4|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.32">Acts iv.
32</scripRef>.</p></note>and yet were they divided into many bodies; their unanimity however
made the many one.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p12">Then, as adding to the force of it, He saith, “so
far from serving, he will even hate and abhor:” “For either
he will hate the one,” saith He, “and love the other, or
else he will hold to the one and despise the other.” And it seems
indeed as if the same thing were said twice over; He did not however
choose this form without purpose, but in order to show that the change
for the better is easy. I mean, lest thou shouldest say, “I am
once for all made a slave; I am brought under the tyranny of
wealth,” He signifies that it is possible to transfer one’s
self, and that as from the first to the second, so also from the second
one may pass over to the first.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p13">2. Having thus, you see, spoken generally, that He might
persuade the hearer to be an uncorrupt judge of His words, and to
sentence according to the very nature of the things; when he hath made
sure of his assent, then, and not till then, He discovers Himself. Thus
He presently adds, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” Let us
shudder to think what we have brought Christ to say; with the name of
God, to put that of gold. But if this be shocking, its taking place in
our deeds, our preferring the tyranny of gold to the fear of God, is
much more shocking.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p14">“What then? Was not this possible among the
ancients?” By no means. “How then,” saith one,
“did Abraham, how did Job obtain a good report?” Tell me
not of them that are rich, but of them that serve riches. Since Job
also was rich, but he served not mammon, but possessed it and ruled
over it, and was a master, not a slave. Therefore he so possessed all
those things, as if he had been the steward of another man’s
goods; not only not extorting from others, but even giving up his own
to them that were in need. And what is more, when he had them they were
no joy to him: so he also declared, saying, “If I did so much as
rejoice when my wealth waxed great:”<note n="909" id="iii.XXI-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p15"><scripRef passage="Job xxxi. 25" id="iii.XXI-p15.1" parsed="|Job|31|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.31.25">Job xxxi.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>wherefore neither did he grieve when it was gone. But they that are
rich are not now such as he was, but are rather in a worse condition
than any slave, paying as it were tribute to some grievous tyrant.
Because their mind is as a kind of citadel occupied by the love of
money, which from thence daily sends out unto them its commands full of
all iniquity, and there is none to disobey. Be not therefore thus over
subtle.<note n="910" id="iii.XXI-p15.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p16">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p16.1">Μ
τοινυν
περιττ
φιλοσφει</span>.]</p></note> Nay, for God hath once for all declared and pronounced it a thing
impossible for the one service and the other to agree. Say not thou,
then, “it is possible.” Why, when the one master is
commanding thee to spoil by violence, the other to strip thyself of thy
possessions; the one to be chaste, the other to commit fornication; the
one to be drunken and luxurious, the other to keep the belly in
subjection; the one again to despise the things that are, the other to
be rivetted to the present; the one to admire marbles, and walls, and
roofs, the other to contemn these, but to honor self-restraint: how is
it possible that these should agree?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p17">Now He calls mammon here “a master,” not
because of its own nature, but on account of the wretchedness of them
that bow themselves beneath it. So also He calls “the belly a
god,”<note n="911" id="iii.XXI-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p18"><scripRef passage="Phil. iii. 19" id="iii.XXI-p18.1" parsed="|Phil|3|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.3.19">Phil. iii.
19</scripRef>.</p></note>not from the dignity of such a mistress, but from the wretchedness of
them that are enslaved: it being a thing worse than any punishment, and
enough, before the punishment, in the way of vengeance on him who is
involved in it. For what condemned criminals can be so wretched, as
they who having God for their Lord, do from that mild rule desert to
this grievous tyranny, and this when their act brings after it so much
harm even here? For indeed their loss is unspeakable by so doing: there
are suits, and molestations, and strifes, and toils, and a blinding of
the soul; and what is more grievous than all, one falls away from the
highest blessings; for such a blessing it is to be God’s
servant.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p19">3. Having now, as you see, in all ways taught the
advantage of contemning riches, as well for the very preservation of
the riches, as for the pleasure of the soul, and for acquiring
self-command, and for the securing of godliness; He proceeds to
establish the practicability of this command. For this especially
pertains to the best legislation, not only to enjoin what is expedient,
but also to make it possible. Therefore He also goes on to say,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p20">“Take no thought<note n="912" id="iii.XXI-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p21">[R.V., more correctly, “Be not anxious,”
and so throughout the chapter.—R.]</p></note>for your life,<note n="913" id="iii.XXI-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p22"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p22.1">τ
ψυχ,</span> “your
soul.” [So Chrysostom interprets (see below); but the New
Testament passage must refer to physical life. In the latter part of
the verse the higher “life” is suggested. But to understand
the argument of Chrysostom, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p22.2">ψυχ</span>
must be rendered “soul” throughout this
passage.—R.]</p></note>what ye shall eat.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p23">That is, lest they should say, “What then? if we
cast all away, how shall we be able to live?” At this objection,
in what follows, He makes a stand, very seasonably. For as

<pb n="145" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_145.html" id="iii.XXI-Page_145" />

surely as if at the beginning He had said,
“Take no thought,” the word would have seemed burdensome;
so surely, now that He hath shown the mischief arising out of
covetousness, His admonition coming after is made easy to receive.
Wherefore neither did He now simply say, “Take no thought,”
but He added the reason, and so enjoined this. After having said,
“Ye cannot serve God and mammon,” He added,
“therefore I say unto you, take no thought. Therefore;” for
what? Because of the unspeakable loss. For the hurt you receive is not
in riches only, rather the wound is in the most vital parts, and in
that which is the overthrow of your salvation; casting you as it does
out from God, who made you, and careth for you, and loveth you.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p24">“Therefore I say unto you, take no thought.”
Thus, after He hath shown the hurt to be unspeakable, then and not
before He makes the commandment stricter; in that He not only bids us
cast away what we have, but forbids to take thought even for our
necessary food, saying, “Take no thought for your soul, what ye
shall eat.” Not because the soul needs food, for it is
incorporeal; but He spake according to the common custom. For though it
needs not food, yet can it not endure to remain in the body, except
that be fed. And in saying this, He puts it not simply so, but here
also He brings up arguments, some from those things which we have
already, and some from other examples.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p25">From what we have already, thus saying:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p26">“Is not the soul more than meat, and the body more
than the raiment?”<note n="914" id="iii.XXI-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 25" id="iii.XXI-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|6|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.25">Matt. vi.
25</scripRef>. [R.V., “Is not the
life more than the food,” <i>i.e.</i>, the food that sustains
it.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p28">He therefore that hath given the greater, how shall He
not give the less? He that hath fashioned the flesh that is fed, how
shall He not bestow the food? Wherefore neither did He simply say,
“Take no thought what ye shall eat,” or “wherewithal
ye shall be clothed;” but, “for the body,” and,
“for the soul:” forasmuch as from them He was to make His
demonstrations, carrying on His discourse in the way of comparison. Now
the soul He hath given once for all, and it abides such as it is; but
the body increases every day. Therefore pointing out both these things,
the immortality of the one, and the frailty of the other, He subjoins
and says,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p29">“Which of you can add one cubit unto his
stature?”<note n="915" id="iii.XXI-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 27" id="iii.XXI-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|6|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.27">Matt. vi.
27</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p31">Thus, saying no more of the soul, since it receives not
increase, He discoursed of the body only; hereby making manifest this
point also, that not the food increases it, but the providence of God.
Which Paul showing also in other ways, said, “So then, neither is
he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that
giveth the increase.”<note n="916" id="iii.XXI-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p32"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 7" id="iii.XXI-p32.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.7">1 Cor. iii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p33">From what we have already, then, He urges us in this
way: and from examples of other things, by saying, “Behold the
fowls of the air.”<note n="917" id="iii.XXI-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 26" id="iii.XXI-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|6|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.26">Matt. vi.
26</scripRef>.</p></note> Thus, lest any should say, “we do good by taking thought,”
He dissuades them both by that which is greater, and by that which is
less; by the greater, <i>i.e.</i> the soul and the body; by the less,
<i>i.e.</i> the birds. For if of the things that are very inferior He
hath so much regard, how shall He not give unto you? saith He. And to
them on this wise, for as yet it was an ordinary<note n="918" id="iii.XXI-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p35"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p35.1">δημδη</span>.</p></note>multitude: but to the devil not thus; but how? “Man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
of God.”<note n="919" id="iii.XXI-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p36"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 4" id="iii.XXI-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.4">Matt. iv.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> But here He makes mention of the birds, and this in a way greatly to
abash them; which sort of thing is of very great value for the purpose
of admonition.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p37">4. However, some of the ungodly have come to so great a
pitch of madness, as even to attack His illustration. Because, say
they, it was not meet for one strengthening<note n="920" id="iii.XXI-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p38"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p38.1">ἀλεφοντα</span>.</p></note>moral principle, to use natural advantages as incitements to that end.
For to those animals, they add, this belongs by nature. What then shall
we say to this? That even though it is theirs by nature, yet possibly
we too may attain it by choice. For neither did He say, “behold
how the birds fly,” which were a thing impossible to man; but
that they are fed without taking thought, a kind of thing easy to be
achieved by us also, if we will. And this they have proved, who have
accomplished it in their actions.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p39">Wherefore it were meet exceedingly to admire the
consideration of our Lawgiver, in that, when He might bring forward His
illustration from among men, and when He might have spoken of Moses and
Elias and John, and others like them, who took no thought; that He
might touch them more to the quick, He made mention of the irrational
beings. For had He spoken of those righteous men, these would have been
able to say, “We are not yet become like them.” But now by
passing them over in silence, and bringing forward the fowls of the
air, He hath cut off from them every excuse, imitating in this place
also the old law. Yea, for the old covenant

things, which those animals possess by nature, those we are able to
accomplish by an act of our choice. If then He take so great care of
them which exist for our sakes, much more of us; if of the servants,
much more of the master. Therefore He said, “Behold the
fowls,” and He said not, “for they do not traffic, nor make
merchandise,”<note n="923" id="iii.XXI-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p42"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p42.1">καπηλεουσινἐ<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p42.2">μπορεονται</span></span>:
two words which in the New Testament are always used in a bad
sense.</p></note>for these were among the things that were earnestly forbidden. But
what? “they sow not, neither do they reap.” “What
then?” saith one, “must we not sow?” He said not,
“we must not sow,” but “we must not <i>take
thought</i>;” neither that one ought not to work, but not to be
low-minded, nor to rack one’s self with cares. Since He bade us
also be nourished, but not in “taking thought.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p43">Of this lesson David also lays the foundation from old
time, saying enigmatically on this wise, “Thou openest Thine

diligence, but the providence of God, even where we seem to be active,

but because we are far from so doing. So that just as the drunkard
would not easily believe, that there exists any man who doth not taste
even water (and yet this hath been achieved by many solitaries in our
time<note n="931" id="iii.XXI-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p56">See Sulpicius Severus, Dial. i. c. 14. “It is
told of a certain holy man that he constantly and entirely abstained
from all drink: and that by way of food, he lived upon seven figs
only.”</p></note>); nor he who connects himself with numberless women, that it is easy
to live in virginity; nor he that extorts other men’s goods, that
one shall readily give up even his own: so neither will those, who
daily melt themselves down with innumerable anxieties, easily receive
this thing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p57">Now as to the fact, that there are many who have
attained unto this, we might show it even from those, who have
practised this self-denial even in our generation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p58">But for you, just now, it is enough to learn not to
covet, and that almsgiving is a good thing; and to know that you must
impart of what ye have. For these things if thou wilt duly perform,
beloved, thou wilt speedily proceed to those others also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p59">6. For the present therefore let us lay aside our
excessive sumptuousness, and let us endure moderation, and learn to
acquire by honest labor all that we are to have: since even the blessed
John, when he was discoursing with those that were employed upon the
tribute, and with the soldiery, enjoined them “to be content with
their wages.”<note n="932" id="iii.XXI-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p60"><scripRef passage="Luke iii. 14" id="iii.XXI-p60.1" parsed="|Luke|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.3.14">Luke iii.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> Anxious though he were to lead them on to another, and a higher
self-command, yet since they were still unfit for this, he speaks of
the lesser things. Because, if he had mentioned what are higher than
these, they would have failed to apply themselves to them, and would
have fallen from the others.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p61">For this very reason we too are practising you<note n="933" id="iii.XXI-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p62">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXI-p62.1">ύμ
γυμνζομεν</span>,
“we are exercising you.”—R.]</p></note>in the inferior duties. Yes, because

<pb n="147" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_147.html" id="iii.XXI-Page_147" />

as yet, we know, the burden of voluntary poverty is too
great for you, and the heaven is not more distant from the earth, than
such self-denial from you. Let us then lay hold, if it be only of the
lowest commandments, for even this is no small encouragement. And yet
some amongst the heathens have achieved even this, though not in a
proper spirit, and have stripped themselves of all their possessions.<note n="934" id="iii.XXI-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXI-p63">So Aristippus: <i>vid</i>. Hor. <i>Serm</i>. 2, 3,
100.</p></note> However, we are contented in your case, if alms are bestowed abundantly
by you; for we shall soon arrive at those other duties too, if we
advance in this way. But if we do not so much as this, of what favor
shall we be worthy, who are bidden to surpass those under the old law,
and yet show ourselves inferior to the philosophers among the heathens?
What shall we say, who when we ought to be angels and sons of God, do
not even quite maintain our being as men? For to spoil and to covet
comes not of the gentleness of men, but of the fierceness of wild
beasts; nay, worse than wild beasts are the assailers of their
neighbor’s goods. For to them this comes by nature, but we who
are honored with reason, and yet are falling away unto that unnatural
vileness, what indulgence shall we receive?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXI-p64">Let us then, considering the measures of that discipline
which is set before us, press on at least to the middle station, that
we may both be delivered from the punishment which is to come, and
proceeding regularly, may arrive at the very summit of all good things;
unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.XXII-p3">“Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;
they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you, That even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XXII-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXII-p4.1">Having</span> spoken of our necessary
food, and having signified that not even for this should we take
thought, He passes on in what follows to that which is more easy. For
raiment is not so necessary as food.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p5">Why then did He not make use here also of the same
example, that of the birds, neither mention to us the peacock, and the
swan, and the sheep? for surely there were many such examples to take
from thence. Because He would point out how very far the argument may
be carried both ways:<note n="935" id="iii.XXII-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p6"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p6.1">ἑκατρωθεν
δεξαι τν

“cheapness” first, then
“meanness.”—R.]</p></note>of the things that partake of such elegance, and from the munificence
vouchsafed to the lilies, in respect of their adorning. For this cause,
when He hath decked them out, He doth not so much as call them lilies
any more, but “grass of the field.”<note n="937" id="iii.XXII-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p8"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 30" id="iii.XXII-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|6|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.30">Matt. vi.
30</scripRef>.</p></note> And He is not satisfied even with this name, but again adds another
circumstance of vileness, saying, “which to-day is.” And He
said not, “and to-morrow is not,” but what is much baser
yet, “is cast into the oven.” And He said not,
“clothe,” but “so clothe.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p9">Seest thou everywhere how He abounds in amplifications
and intensities? And this He doth, that He may touch them home: and
therefore He hath also added, “shall He not much more clothe
you?” For this too hath much emphasis: the force of the word,
“you,” being no other than to indicate covertly the great
value set upon our race, and the concern shown for it; as though He had
said, “you, to whom He gave a soul, for whom He fashioned a body,
for whose sake He made all the things that are seen, for whose sake He
sent prophets, and gave the law, and wrought those innumerable good
works; for whose sake He gave up His only begotten Son.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p10">And not till He hath made His proof clear, doth He
proceed also to rebuke them, say

<pb n="148" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_148.html" id="iii.XXII-Page_148" />

ing, “O ye of little faith.” For this is the
quality of an adviser: He doth not admonish only, but reproves also,
that He may awaken men the more to the persuasive power of His
words.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p11">Hereby He teaches us not only to take no thought, but
not even to be dazzled at the costliness of men’s apparel. Why,
such comeliness is of grass, such beauty of the green herb: or rather,
the grass is even more precious than such apparelling. Why then pride
thyself on things, whereof the prize rests with the mere plant, with a
great balance in its favor?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p12">And see how from the beginning He signifies the
injunction to be easy; by the contraries again, and by the things of
which they were afraid, leading them away from these cares. Thus, when
He had said, “Consider the lilies of the field,” He added,
“they toil not:” so that in desire to set us free from
toils, did He give these commands. In fact, the labor lies, not in
taking no thought, but in taking thought for these things. And as in
saying, “they sow not,” it was not the sowing that He did
away with, but the anxious thought; so in saying, “they toil not,
neither do they spin,” He put an end not to the work, but to the
care.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p13">But if Solomon was surpassed by their beauty, and that
not once nor twice, but throughout all his reign:—for neither can
one say, that at one time He was clothed with such apparel, but after
that He was so no more; rather not so much as on one day did He array
Himself so beautifully: for this Christ declared by saying, “in
all his reign:” and if it was not that He was surpassed by this
flower, but vied with that, but He gave place to all alike (wherefore
He also said, “as one of these:” for such as between the
truth and the counterfeit, so great is the interval between those robes
and these flowers):—if then he acknowledged his inferiority, who
was more glorious than all kings that ever were: when wilt thou be able
to surpass, or rather to approach even faintly to such perfection of
form?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p14">After this He instructs us, not to aim at all at such
ornament. See at least the end thereof; after its triumph “it is
cast into the oven:” and if of things mean, and worthless, and of
no great use, God hath displayed so great care, how shall He give up
thee, of all living creatures the most important?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p15">Wherefore then did He make them so beautiful? That He
might display His own wisdom and the excellency of His power; that from
everything we might learn His glory. For not “the Heavens only
declare the glory of God,”<note n="938" id="iii.XXII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p16"><scripRef passage="Ps. xix. 1" id="iii.XXII-p16.1" parsed="|Ps|19|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.19.1">Ps. xix.
1</scripRef>.</p></note>but the earth too; and this David declared when he said, “Praise
the Lord, ye fruitful trees, and all cedars.”<note n="939" id="iii.XXII-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p17"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxlviii. 9" id="iii.XXII-p17.1" parsed="|Ps|48|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.48.9">Ps.
cxlviii. 9</scripRef>.</p></note> For some by their fruits, some by their greatness, some by their
beauty, send up praise to Him who made them: this too being a sign of
great excellency of wisdom, when even upon things that are very vile
(and what can be viler than that which to-day is, and to-morrow is
not?) He pours out such great beauty. If then to the grass He hath
given that which it needs not (for what doth the beauty thereof help to
the feeding of the fire?) how shall He not give unto thee that which
thou needest? If that which is the vilest of all things, He hath
lavishly adorned, and that as doing it not for need, but for
munificence, how much more will He honor thee, the most honorable of
all things, in matters which are of necessity.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p18">2. Now when, as you see, He had demonstrated the
greatness of God’s providential care, and they were in what
follows to be rebuked also, even in this He was sparing, laying to
their charge not want, but poverty, of faith. Thus, “if
God,” saith He, “so clothe the grass of the field, much
more you, O ye of little faith.”<note n="940" id="iii.XXII-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p19"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 30" id="iii.XXII-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|6|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.30">Matt. vi.
30</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p20">And yet surely all these things He Himself works. For
“all things were made by Him, and without Him was not so much as
one thing made.”<note n="941" id="iii.XXII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p21"><scripRef passage="John i. 3" id="iii.XXII-p21.1" parsed="|John|1|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.3">John i.
3</scripRef>.</p></note> But yet He nowhere as yet makes mention of Himself: it being sufficient
for the time, to indicate His full power, that He said at each of the
commandments, “Ye have heard that it hath been said to them of
old time, but I say unto you.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p22">Marvel not then, when in subsequent instances also He
conceals Himself, or speaks something lowly of Himself: since for the
present He had but one object, that His word might prove such as they
would readily receive, and might in every way demonstrate that He was
not a sort of adversary of God, but of one mind, and in agreement with
the Father.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p23">Which accordingly He doth here also; for through so many
words as He hath spent He ceases not to set Him before us, admiring His
wisdom, His providence, His tender care extending through all things,
both great and small. Thus, both when He was speaking of Jerusalem, He
called it “the city of the Great King;”<note n="942" id="iii.XXII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 35" id="iii.XXII-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|5|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.35">Matt. v.
35</scripRef>.</p></note>and when He mentioned Heaven, He spake of it again as
“God’s throne;”<note n="943" id="iii.XXII-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p25"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 34" id="iii.XXII-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|5|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.34">Matt. v.
34</scripRef>.</p></note>and when He was discoursing of His economy in the world, to Him again
He attributes it all, saying, “He maketh His sun

<pb n="149" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_149.html" id="iii.XXII-Page_149" />

to rise on the evil and on the good, and
sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”<note n="944" id="iii.XXII-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p26"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 45" id="iii.XXII-p26.1" parsed="|Matt|5|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.45">Matt. v.
45</scripRef>.</p></note> And in the prayer too He taught us to say, His “is the kingdom
and the power and the glory.” And here in discoursing of His
providence, and signifying how even in little things He is the most
excellent of artists, He saith, that “He clothes the grass of the
field.” And nowhere doth He call Him His own Father, but theirs;
in order that by the very honor He might reprove them, and that when He
should call Him His Father, they might no more be displeased.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p27">Now if for bare necessaries one is not to take thought,
what pardon can we<note n="945" id="iii.XXII-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p28">[Or, “they,” as in the next
sentence.—R.]</p></note>deserve, who take thought for things expensive? Or rather, what pardon
can they deserve, who do even without sleep, that they may take the
things of others?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p29">3. “Therefore take no thought, saying, what shall
we eat? or, what shall we drink? or, wherewithal shall we be clothed?
For after all these things do the nations of the world
seek.”<note n="946" id="iii.XXII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 31, 32" id="iii.XXII-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|6|31|6|32" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.31-Matt.6.32">Matt. vi.
31, 32</scripRef>. [The text of
Chrysostom is in doubt here: one <span class="c20" id="iii.XXII-p30.2">ms</span>. omits
“of the world.” The longer reading is probably due to a
recollection of <scripRef passage="Luke xii. 30" id="iii.XXII-p30.3" parsed="|Luke|12|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.30">Luke xii.
30</scripRef>, where this form
occurs.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p31">Seest thou how again He hath both shamed them the more,
and hath also shown by the way, that He had commanded nothing grievous
nor burdensome? As therefore when He said, “If ye love them which
love you,” it is nothing great which ye practise, for the very
Gentiles do the same; by the mention of the Gentiles He was stirring
them up to something greater: so now also He brings them forward to
reprove us, and to signify that it is a necessary debt which He is
requiring of us. For if we must show forth something more than the
Scribes or Pharisees, what can we deserve, who so far from going beyond
these, do even abide in the mean estate of the Gentiles, and emulate
their littleness of soul?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p32">He doth not however stop at the rebuke, but having by
this reproved and roused them, and shamed them with all strength of
expression, by another argument He also comforts them, saying,
“For your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
things.” He said not, “God knoweth,” but, “your
Father knoweth;” to lead them to a greater hope. For if He be a
Father, and such a Father, He will not surely be able to overlook His
children in extremity of evils; seeing that not even men, being
fathers, bear to do so.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p33">And He adds along with this yet another argument. Of
what kind then is it? That “ye have need” of them. What He
saith is like this. What! are these things superfluous, that He should
disregard them? Yet not even in superfluities did He show Himself
wanting in regard, in the instance of the grass: but now are these
things even necessary. So that what thou considerest a cause for thy
being anxious, this I say is sufficient to draw thee from such anxiety.
I mean, if thou sayest, “Therefore I must needs take thought,
because they are necessary;” on the contrary, I say, “Nay,
for this self-same reason take no thought, because they are
necessary.” Since were they superfluities, not even then ought we
to despair, but to feel confident about the supply of them; but now
that they are necessary, we must no longer be in doubt. For what kind
of father is he, who can endure to fail in supplying to his children
even necessaries? So that for this cause again God will most surely
bestow them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p34">For indeed He is the artificer of our nature, and He
knows perfectly the wants thereof. So that neither canst thou say,
“He is indeed our Father, and the things we seek are necessary,
but He knows not that we stand in need of them.” For He that
knows our nature itself, and was the framer of it, and formed it such
as it is; evidently He knows its need also better than thou, who art
placed in want of them: it having been by His decree, that our nature
is in such need. He will not therefore oppose Himself to what He hath
willed, first subjecting it of necessity to so great want, and on the
other hand again depriving it of what it wants, and of absolute
necessaries.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p35">Let us not therefore be anxious, for we shall gain
nothing by it, but tormenting ourselves. For whereas He gives both when
we take thought, and when we do not, and more of the two, when we do
not; what dost thou gain by thy anxiety, but to exact of thyself a
superfluous penalty? Since one on the point of going to a plentiful
feast, will not surely permit himself to take thought for food; nor is
he that is walking to a fountain anxious about drink. Therefore seeing
we have a supply more copious than either any fountain, or innumerable
banquets made ready, the providence of God; let us not be beggars, nor
little minded.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p36">4. For together with what hath been said, He puts also
yet another reason for feeling confidence about such things,
saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p37">“Seek ye the kingdom of Heaven, and all these
things shall be added unto you.”<note n="947" id="iii.XXII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 33" id="iii.XXII-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|6|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.33">Matt. vi.
33</scripRef>. [The reading of this
verse given by Chrysostom is peculiar. The best authorities support the
form accepted in the R.V., “his kingdom and his
righteousness.” But the reading of the received text is ancient.
Some other Fathers agree with Chrysostom. The phrase “kingdom of
heaven” is peculiar to Matthew.—R.]</p></note>
</p>

<pb n="150" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_150.html" id="iii.XXII-Page_150" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p39">Thus when He had set the soul free from anxiety, then He
made mention also of Heaven. For indeed He came to do away with the old
things, and to call us to a greater country. Therefore He doeth all, to
deliver us from things unnecessary, and from our affection for the
earth. For this cause He mentioned the heathens also, saying that
“the Gentiles seek after these things;” they whose whole
labor is for the present life, who have no regard for the things to
come, nor any thought of Heaven. But to you not these present are the
chief things,<note n="948" id="iii.XXII-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p40"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p40.1">προηγομενα</span>
.</p></note>but other than these. For we were not born for this end, that we should
eat and drink and be clothed, but that we might please God, and attain
unto the good things to come. Therefore as things here are secondary in
our labor, so also in our prayers let them be secondary. Therefore He
also said, “Seek ye the kingdom of Heaven, and all these things
shall be added unto you.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p41">And He said not, “shall be given,” but
“shall be added,” that thou mightest learn, that the things
present are no great part of His gifts, compared with the greatness of
the things to come. Accordingly, He doth not bid us so much as ask for
them, but while we ask for other things, to have confidence, as though
these also were added to those. Seek then the things to come, and thou
wilt receive the things present also; seek not the things that are
seen, and thou shalt surely attain unto them. Yea, for it is unworthy
of thee to approach thy Lord for such things. And thou, who oughtest to
spend all thy zeal and thy care for those unspeakable blessings, dost
greatly disgrace thyself by consuming it on the desire of transitory
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p42">“How then?” saith one, “did He not bid
us ask for bread?” Nay, He added, “daily,” and to
this again, “this day,” which same thing in fact He doth
here also. For He said not, “Take no thought,” but,
“Take no thought for the morrow,” at the same time both
affording us liberty, and fastening our soul on those things that are
more necessary to us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p43">For to this end also He bade us ask even those, not as
though God needed reminding by us, but that we might learn that by His
help we accomplish whatever we do accomplish, and that we might be made
more His own by our continual prayer for these things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p44">Seest thou how by this again He would persuade them,
that they shall surely receive the things present? For He that bestows
the greater, much more will He give the less. “For not for this
end,” saith He, “did I tell you not to take thought nor to
ask, that ye should suffer distress, and go about naked, but in order
that ye might be in abundance of these things also:” and this,
you see, was suited above all things to attract them to Him. So that
like as in almsgiving, when deterring them from making a display to
men, He won upon them chiefly by promising to furnish them with it more
liberally;—“for thy Father,” saith He, “who
seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly;”<note n="949" id="iii.XXII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 4" id="iii.XXII-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.4">Matt. vi.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>—even so here also, in drawing them off from seeking these
things, this is His persuasive topic, that He promises to bestow it on

He, do I bid thee not seek, not that thou mayest not receive, but that
thou mayest receive plentifully; that thou mayest receive in the
fashion<note n="950" id="iii.XXII-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p46"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p46.1">σχματο</span>.</p></note>that becomes thee, with the profit which thou oughtest to have; that
thou mayest not, by taking thought, and distracting thyself in anxiety
about these, render thyself unworthy both of these, and of the things
spiritual; that thou mayest not undergo unnecessary distress, and again
fall away from that which is set before thee.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p47">5. “Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for
sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof:” that is to say, the
affliction, and the bruising thereof.<note n="951" id="iii.XXII-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p48"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 34" id="iii.XXII-p48.1" parsed="|Matt|5|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.34">Matt. v.

from it, but affliction, and trouble, and calamities; much as in

the dismay and anguish which
thereby sprang up within them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p54">This then is His meaning here also, when He saith,
“sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.” For nothing
so pains the soul, as carefulness and anxiety. Thus did Paul also, when
urging to celibacy, give counsel, saying, “I would have you
without carefulness.”<note n="956" id="iii.XXII-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p55"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 32" id="iii.XXII-p55.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.32">1 Cor. vii.

the same origin as the word rendered “take no thought” in
the A.V.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p56">But when He saith, “the morrow shall take thought
for itself,” He saith it not, as though the day took thought for
these things, but forasmuch as He had to speak to a people somewhat
imperfect, willing to make what He saith more expressive, He
personifies the time, speaking unto them according to the custom of the
generality.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p57">And here indeed He advises, but as He proceeds, He even
makes it a law, saying, “provide neither gold nor silver, nor
scrip for your journey.”<note n="957" id="iii.XXII-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p58"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 9, 10" id="iii.XXII-p58.1" parsed="|Matt|10|9|10|10" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.9-Matt.10.10">Matt. x. 9,

introduces the verbal enactment of it more determinately, the precept
too having then become more easy of acceptance, confirmed as it had
been previously by His own actions. Where then did He confirm it by His
actions? Hear Him saying, “The Son of Man hath not where to lay
His head.”<note n="958" id="iii.XXII-p58.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p59"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 20" id="iii.XXII-p59.1" parsed="|Matt|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.20">Matt. viii.
20</scripRef>.</p></note> Neither is He satisfied with this only, but in His disciples also He
exhibits His full proof of these things, by fashioning them too in like
manner, yet not suffering them to be in want of anything.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p60">But mark His tender care also, how He surpasses the
affection of any father. Thus, “This I command,” saith He,
“for nothing else, but that I may deliver you from superfluous
anxieties. For even if to-day thou hast taken thought for to-morrow,
thou wilt also have to take thought again to-morrow. Why then what is
over and above? Why force the day to receive more than the distress
which is allotted to it, and together with its own troubles add to it
also the burden of the following day; and this, when there is no chance
of thy lightening the other by the addition so taking place, but thou
art merely to exhibit thyself as coveting superfluous troubles?”
Thus, that He may reprove them the more, He doth all but give life to
the very time, and brings it in as one injured, and exclaiming against
them for their causeless despite. Why, thou hast received the day, to
care for the things thereof. Wherefore then add unto it the things of
the other day also? Hath it not then burden enough in its own anxiety?
Why now, I pray, dost thou make it yet heavier? Now when the Lawgiver
saith these things, and He that is to pass judgment on us, consider the
hopes that He suggests to us, how good they are; He Himself testifying,
that this life is wretched and wearisome, so that the anxiety even of
the one day is enough to hurt and afflict us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p61">6. Nevertheless, after so many and so grave words, we
take thought for these things, but for the things in Heaven no longer:
rather we have reversed His order, on either side fighting against His
sayings. For mark; “Seek ye not the things present,” saith
He, “at all;” but we are seeking these things for ever:
“seek the things in Heaven,” saith He; but those things we
seek not so much as for a short hour, but according to the greatness of
the anxiety we display about the things of the world, is the
carelessness we entertain in things spiritual; or rather even much
greater. But this doth not prosper for ever; neither can this be for
ever. What if for ten days we think scorn? if for twenty? if for an
hundred? must we not of absolute necessity depart, and fall into the
hands of the Judge?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p62">“But the delay hath comfort.” And what sort
of comfort, to be every day looking for punishment and vengeance? Nay,
if thou wouldest have some comfort from this delay, take it by
gathering for thyself the fruit of amendment after repentance. Since if
the mere delay of vengeance seem to thee a sort of refreshment, far
more is it gain not to fall into the vengeance. Let us then make full
use of this delay, in order to have a full deliverance from the dangers
that press upon us. For none of the things enjoined is either
burdensome or grievous, but all are so light and easy, that if we only
bring a genuine purpose of heart, we may accomplish all, though we be
chargeable with countless offenses. For so Manasses had perpetrated
innumerable pollutions, having both stretched out his hands against the
saints, and brought abominations into the temple, and filled the city
with murders, and wrought many other things beyond excuse; yet
nevertheless after so long and so great wickedness, he washed away from
himself all these things.<note n="959" id="iii.XXII-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p63"><scripRef passage="2 Chron. xxxiii. 1-20; 2 Kings xxi. 1-18" id="iii.XXII-p63.1" parsed="|2Chr|33|1|33|20;|2Kgs|21|1|21|18" osisRef="Bible:2Chr.33.1-2Chr.33.20 Bible:2Kgs.21.1-2Kgs.21.18">2 Chron.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p64">For there is not, yea, there is not any sin, that doth
not yield and give way to the power of repentance, or rather to the
grace of Christ. Since if we would but only change, we have Him to
assist us. And if thou art desirous to become good, there is none to

hinder us; or rather there is one
to hinder us, the devil, yet hath he no power, so long as thou choosest
what is best, and so attractest God to thine aid. But if thou art not
thyself willing, but startest aside, how shall He protect thee? Since
not of necessity or compulsion, but of thine own will, He wills thee to
be saved. For if thou thyself, having a servant full of hatred and
aversion for thee, and continually going off, and fleeing away from
thee, wouldest not choose to keep him, and this though needing his
services; much less will God, who doeth all things not for His own
profit, but for thy salvation, choose to retain thee by compulsion; as
on the other hand, if thou show forth a right intention only, He would
not choose ever to give thee up, no, not whatever the devil may do. So
that we are ourselves to blame for our own destruction. Because we do
not approach, nor beseech, nor entreat Him, as we ought: but even if we
do draw nigh, it is not as persons who have need to receive, neither is
it with the proper faith, nor as making demand, but we do all in a
gaping and listless way.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p65">7. And yet God would have us demand things of Him, and
for this accounts Himself greatly bound to thee.<note n="960" id="iii.XXII-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p66">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p66.1">κα

pressing earnestly that makes the demand, He pays down even what He
hath not received of us; but if sluggishly, He too keeps on making
delays; not through unwillingness to give, but because He is pleased to
have the demand made upon Him by us. For this cause He told thee also
the example of that friend, who came by night, and asked a loaf;<note n="961" id="iii.XXII-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p67"><scripRef passage="Luke xi. 5-8" id="iii.XXII-p67.1" parsed="|Luke|11|5|11|8" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.5-Luke.11.8">Luke xi.

actions, when He dismissed that Phœnician woman, having filled her
with His great gift.<note n="963" id="iii.XXII-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p69"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 21-28; Mark vii. 24-30" id="iii.XXII-p69.1" parsed="|Matt|15|21|15|28;|Mark|7|24|7|30" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.21-Matt.15.28 Bible:Mark.7.24-Mark.7.30">Matt. xv.

even the things that pertain not to them. “For it is not

to give<note n="964" id="iii.XXII-p69.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p70"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p70.1">δοναι</span>. See Hom. LII.</p></note>it unto the dogs.” But for all that He gave, because she demanded
of him earnestly. But by the Jews He showed, that to them that are
careless, He gives not even their own. They accordingly received
nothing, but lost what was their own. And while these, because they
asked not, did not receive so much as their very own; she, because she
assailed Him with earnestness, had power to obtain even what pertained
to others, and the dog received what was the children’s. So great
a good is importunity. For though thou be a dog, yet being importunate,
thou shalt be preferred to the child being negligent: for what things
affection accomplishes not, these, all of them, importunity did
accomplish. Say not therefore, “God is an enemy to me, and will
not hearken.” He doth straightway answer thee, continually
troubling him, if not because thou art His friend, yet because of thine
importunity. And neither the enmity, or the unseasonable time, nor
anything else becomes an hindrance. Say not, “I am unworthy, and
do not pray;” for such was the Syrophœnician woman too. Say
not, “I have sinned much, and am not able to entreat Him whom I
have angered;” for God looks not at the desert, but at the
disposition. For if the ruler that feared not God, neither was ashamed
of men, was overcome by the widow, much more will He that is good be
won over by continual entreaty.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p71">So that though thou be no friend, though thou be not
demanding thy due, though thou hast devoured thy Father’s
substance, and have been a long time out of sight, though without
honor, though last of all, though thou approach Him angry, though much
displeased; be willing only to pray, and to return, and thou shalt
receive all, and shall quickly extinguish the wrath and the
condemnation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p72">But, “behold, I pray,” saith one, “and
there is no result.” Why, thou prayest not like those; such I
mean as the Syrophœnician woman, the friend that came late at
night, and the widow that is continually troubling the judge, and the
son that consumed his father’s goods. For didst thou so pray,
thou wouldest quickly obtain. For though despite have been done unto
Him, yet is He a Father; and though He have been provoked to anger, yet
is He fond of His children; and one thing only doth He seek, not to
take vengeance for our affronts, but to see thee repenting and
entreating Him. Would that we were warmed in like measure, as those
bowels are moved to the love of us. But this fire seeks a beginning
only, and if thou afford it a little spark, thou kindlest a full flame
of beneficence. For not because He hath been insulted, is He sore
vexed, but because it is thou who art insulting Him, and so becoming
frenzied. For if we being evil, when our children molest<note n="965" id="iii.XXII-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p73">[The Greek word is that rendered
“insult” in this and the preceding sentence.—R.]</p></note>us, grieve on their account; much more is God, who can

<pb n="153" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_153.html" id="iii.XXII-Page_153" />

not so much as suffer insult, sore vexed on
account of thee, who hast committed it. If we, who love by nature, much
more He, who is kindly affectioned beyond nature. “For
though,” saith He, “a woman should forget the fruits of her
womb, yet will I not forget thee.”<note n="966" id="iii.XXII-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p74"><scripRef passage="Isa. xlix. 15" id="iii.XXII-p74.1" parsed="|Isa|49|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.49.15">Isa. xlix.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p75">8. Let us therefore draw nigh unto Him, and say,
“Truth, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
their masters’ table.”<note n="967" id="iii.XXII-p75.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p76"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 27" id="iii.XXII-p76.1" parsed="|Matt|15|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.27">Matt. xv.

can never draw nigh out of season, for it is unseasonable not to be
continually approaching. For of Him who desires to give it is always
seasonable to ask: yea, as breathing is never out of season, so neither
is praying unseasonable, but rather not praying. Since as we need this
breath, so do we also the help that comes from Him; and if we be
willing, we shall easily draw Him to us. And the prophet, to manifest
this, and to point out the constant readiness of His beneficence, said,
“We shall find Him prepared as the morning.”<note n="968" id="iii.XXII-p76.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p77"><scripRef passage="Hosea vi. 3" id="iii.XXII-p77.1" parsed="|Hos|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.6.3">Hosea vi.
3</scripRef>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XXII-p77.2">LXX</span>. “His going forth is prepared as the
morning,” agreeing with the present Hebrew copies. The sentiment
of both readings (as we so often find, apparently by a special
Providence) is the same. [R.V., “His going forth is sure as the
morning.” This, too, conveys the same general sentiment, but is a
more accurate rendering of the Hebrew.—R.]</p></note> For as often as we may draw nigh, we shall see Him awaiting our
movements. And if we fail to draw from out of His ever-springing
goodness, the blame is all ours. This, for example, was His complaint
against certain Jews, when He said, “My mercy is as a morning
cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.”<note n="969" id="iii.XXII-p77.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p78"><scripRef passage="Hosea vi. 4" id="iii.XXII-p78.1" parsed="|Hos|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.6.4">Hosea vi.

is as the morning cloud;” and so also <span class="c41" id="iii.XXII-p78.2">LXX.</span> <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p78.3">τ λεο
μν</span>. And with this the Hebrew copies agree, as did St.
Jerome’s (<i>in loc.</i> t. vi. 63, Venet. 1768). But St. Cyril
(<i>in loc.</i> t. iii. 96), reads <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p78.4">τ
λεο μο</span>  And St.
Jerome’s Commentary shows that according to his interpretation
the two readings came to the same meaning. “Your mercy, that
wherewith I have always had mercy upon you, hath passed by…for
now is the captivity near.” [R.V., “For your goodness (or,
kindness) is as a morning cloud.” In the Homily <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXII-p78.5">δ</span> occurs, but is not translated.—R.]</p></note> And His meaning is like this; “I indeed have supplied all my
part, but ye, as a hot sun coming over scatters both the cloud and the
dew, and makes them vanish, so have ye by your great wickedness
restrained the unspeakable Beneficence.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXII-p79">Which also itself again is an instance of providential
care: that even when He sees us unworthy to receive good, He withholds
His benefits, lest He render us careless. But if we change a little,
even but so much as to know that we have sinned, He gushes out beyond
the fountains, He is poured forth beyond the ocean; and the more thou
receivest, so much the more doth He rejoice; and in this way is stirred
up again to give us more. For indeed He accounts it as His own wealth,
that we should be saved, and that He should give largely to them that
ask. And this, it may seem, Paul was declaring when He said, that He is
“rich unto all and over all that call upon Him.”<note n="970" id="iii.XXII-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p80"><scripRef passage="Rom. x. 12" id="iii.XXII-p80.1" parsed="|Rom|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.12">Rom. x.

the longer reading in the latter passage, and seems to have combined
the two in the present instance.—R.]</p></note> Because when we pray not, then He is wroth; when we pray not, then doth
He turn away from us. For this cause “He became poor, that He
might make us rich;”<note n="971" id="iii.XXII-p80.8"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXII-p81"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. viii. 9" id="iii.XXII-p81.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.9">2 Cor.

and good hopes, though we sin every day, let us approach Him,
entreating, beseeching, asking the forgiveness of our sins. For thus we
shall be more backward to sin for the time to come; thus shall we drive
away the devil, and shall call forth the lovingkindness of God, and
attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever.

alike, whether in churches, or in states,<note n="979" id="iii.XXIII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p14">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIII-p14.1">πλεσι</span>.]</p></note>or in houses. For except the master judge the servant, and the mistress
the maid, and the father the son, and friends one another, there will
be an increase of all wickedness. And why say I, friends? unless we
judge our enemies, we shall never be able to put an end to our enmity,
but all things will be turned upside down.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p15">What then can the saying be? Let us carefully attend,
lest the medicines of salvation, and the laws of peace, be accounted by
any man laws of overthrow and confusion. First of all, then, even by
what follows, He hath pointed out to them that have understanding the
excellency of this law, saying, “Why beholdest thou the mote that
is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in
thine own eye?”<note n="980" id="iii.XXIII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 3" id="iii.XXIII-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|7|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.3">Matt. vii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p17">But if to many of the less attentive, it seem yet rather
obscure, I will endeavor to explain it from the beginning. In this
place, then, as it seems at least to me, He doth not simply command us
not to judge any of men’s sins, neither doth He simply forbid the
doing of such a thing, but to them that are full of innumerable ills,
and are trampling upon other men for trifles. And I think that certain
Jews too are here hinted at, for that while they were bitter accusing
their neighbors for small faults, and such as came to nothing, they
were themselves insensibly committing deadly<note n="981" id="iii.XXIII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p18"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIII-p18.1">τ

said, “Ye bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, but ye
will not move them with your finger,”<note n="982" id="iii.XXIII-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p19"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 4" id="iii.XXIII-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|23|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.4">Matt.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p21">Well then, I think that these are comprehended in His
invective; that He is checking them beforehand as to those things,
wherein they were hereafter to accuse His disciples. For although His
disciples had been guilty of no such sin, yet in them were supposed to
be offenses; as, for instance, not keeping the sabbath, eating with
unwashen hands, sitting at meat with publicans; of which He saith also
in another place, “Ye which strain at the gnat, and swallow the
camel.”<note n="984" id="iii.XXIII-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 24" id="iii.XXIII-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|23|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.24">Matt.
xxiii. 24</scripRef>. [R.V., more
correctly, “strain out;” the word “at” is
probably a typographical blunder of the A.V.—R.]</p></note> But yet it is also a general law that He is laying down on these
matters.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p23">And the Corinthians<note n="985" id="iii.XXIII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p24"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 5" id="iii.XXIII-p24.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.5">1 Cor. iv.

their own superiors, and upon grounds that are not acknowledged; not
absolutely to refrain from correcting them that sin. Neither indeed was
He then rebuking all without distinction, but disciples doing so to
their teachers were the object of His reproof; and they who, being
guilty of innumerable sins, bring an evil report upon the
guiltless.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p25">This then is the sort of thing which Christ also in this
place intimated; not intimated merely, but guarded<note n="986" id="iii.XXIII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p26"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIII-p26.1">ἐπστησε</span>.</p></note>it too with a great ter

the punishment from which no prayers can deliver.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p27">2. “For with what judgment ye judge,” saith
He, “ye shall be judged.”<note n="987" id="iii.XXIII-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 2" id="iii.XXIII-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.2">Matt. vii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p29">That is, “it is not the other,” saith
Christ, “that thou condemnest, but thyself, and thou art making
the judgment-seat dreadful to thyself, and the account strict.”
As then in the forgiveness of our sins the beginnings are from us, so
also in this judgment, it is by ourselves that the measures of our
condemnation are laid down. You see, we ought not to upbraid nor
trample upon them, but to admonish; not to revile, but to advise; not
to assail with pride, but to correct with tenderness. For not him, but
thyself, dost thou give over to extreme vengeance, by not sparing him,
when it may be needful to give sentence on his offenses.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p30">Seest thou, how these two commandments are both easy,
and fraught with great blessings to the obedient, even as of evils on
the other hand, to the regardless? For both he that forgives his
neighbor, hath freed himself first of the two from the grounds of
complaint, and that without any labor; and he that with tenderness and
indulgence inquires into other men’s offenses, great is the
allowance<note n="988" id="iii.XXIII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p31"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIII-p31.1">ἔρανον</span>.</p></note>of pardon, which he hath by his judgment laid up beforehand for
himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p32">“What then!” say you: “if one commit
fornication, may I not say that fornication is a bad thing, nor at all
correct him that is playing the wanton?” Nay, correct him, but
not as a foe, nor as an adversary exacting a penalty, but as a
physician providing medicines. For neither did Christ say, “stay
not him that is sinning,” but “judge not;” that is,
be not bitter in pronouncing sentence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p33">And besides, it is not of great things (as I have
already observed), nor of things prohibited, that this is said, but of
those which are not even counted offenses. Wherefore He said also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p36">Yea, for many now do this; if they see but a monk

every day. If they see him but partaking rather largely of food, they
become bitter accusers, while they themselves are daily drinking to
excess and surfeiting: not knowing, that besides their own sins, they
do hereby gather up for themselves a greater flame, and deprive
themselves of every plea. For on this point, that thine own doings must
be strictly inquired into, thou thyself hast first made the law, by
thus sentencing those of thy neighbor. Account it not then to be a
grievous thing, if thou art also thyself to undergo the same kind of
trial.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p38">“Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p40">Here His will is to signify the great wrath, which He
hath against them that do such things. For so, wheresoever He would
indicate that the sin is great, and the punishment and wrath in store
for it grievous, He begins with a reproach.<note n="992" id="iii.XXIII-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p41"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIII-p41.1">ὕβρεω</span>.</p></note> As then unto him that was exacting the hundred pence, He said in His

xviii. 32</scripRef>.</p></note>even so here also, “Thou hypocrite.” For not of protecting
care comes such a judgment, but of ill will to man; and while a man
puts forward a mask of benevolence, he is doing a work of the utmost
wickedness, causing reproaches without ground, and accusations, to
cleave unto his neighbors, and usurping a teacher’s rank, when he
is not worthy to be so much as a disciple. On account of this He called
him “hypocrite.” For thou, who in other men’s doings
art so bitter, as to see even the little things; how hast thou become
so remiss in thine own, as that even the great things are hurried over
by thee?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p43">“First cast out the beam out of thine own
eye.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p44">Seest thou, that He forbids not judging, but commands to
cast out first the beam from thine eye, and then to set right the
doings of the rest of the world? For indeed each one knows his own
things better than those of others; and sees the greater rather than
the less; and loves himself more than his neighbor. Wherefore, if thou
doest it out of guardian care, I bid thee care for thyself first, in
whose case the sin is both more certain and greater. But if thou
neglect thyself, it is quite evident that neither dost thou judge thy
brother in care for him, but in hatred, and wishing to expose him. For
what if he ought to be judged? it should be by one who commits no such
sin, not by thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p45">Thus, because He had introduced great and high doctrines
of self denial, lest any man should say, it is easy so to practise it
in words; He willing to signify His entire confidence, and that He was
not chargeable with any of the things that had been mentioned, but had
duly fulfilled all, spake this parable. And that, because He too was
afterwards to

judge, saying,
“Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.”<note n="994" id="iii.XXIII-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 1" id="iii.XXIII-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|23|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.1">Matt.
xxiii. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> Yet was not he chargeable with what hath been mentioned; for neither
did He pull out a mote, nor had He a beam on His eyes, but being clean
from all these, He so corrected the faults of all. “For it is not
at all meet,” saith He, “to judge others, when one is
chargeable with the same things.” And why marvel at His
establishing this law, when even the very thief knew it upon the cross,
saying to the other thief, “Dost not thou fear God, seeing we are
in the same condemnation;”<note n="995" id="iii.XXIII-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p47"><scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 40, 41" id="iii.XXIII-p47.1" parsed="|Luke|23|40|23|41" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.40-Luke.23.41">Luke xxiii.

thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same
condemnation.” In several places Chrysostom gives the plural
form, as here, but there is little authority for it in the New
Testament text.—R.]</p></note>expressing the same sentiments with Christ?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p48">But thou, so far from casting out thine own beam, dost
not even see it, but another’s mote thou not only seest, but also
judgest, and essayest to cast it out; as if any one seized with a
grievous dropsy, or indeed with any other incurable disease, were to
neglect this, and find fault with another who was neglecting a slight
swelling. And if it be an evil not to see one’s own sins, it is a
twofold and threefold evil to be even sitting in judgment on others,
while men themselves, as if past feeling, are bearing about beams in
their own eyes: since no beam is so heavy as sin.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p49">His injunction therefore in these words is as follows,
that he who is chargeable with countless evil deeds, should not be a
bitter censor of other men’s offenses, and especially when these
are trifling. He is not overthrowing reproof nor correction, but
forbidding men to neglect their own faults, and exult over those of
other men.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p50">For indeed this was a cause of men’s going unto
great vice, bringing in a twofold wickedness. For he, whose practice it
had been to slight his own faults, great as they were, and to search
bitterly into those of others, being slight and of no account, was
spoiling himself two ways: first, by thinking lightly of his own
faults; next, by incurring enmities and feuds with all men, and
training himself every day to extreme fierceness, and want of feeling
for others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p51">3. Having then put away all these things, by this His
excellent legislation, He added yet another charge, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p52">“Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,
neither cast ye your pearls before swine.”<note n="996" id="iii.XXIII-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p53"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 6" id="iii.XXIII-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.6">Matt. vii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p54">“Yet surely further on,” it will be said,

living in incurable ungodliness, and affording no hope of change for
the better; and by “swine,” them that abide continually in
an unchaste life, all of whom He hath pronounced unworthy of hearing
such things. Paul also, it may be observed, declared this when He said,
“But a natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit, for
they are foolishness unto him.”<note n="999" id="iii.XXIII-p56.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p57"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 14" id="iii.XXIII-p57.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.14">1 Cor. ii.

man.</p></note> And in many other places too He saith that corruption of life is the
cause of men’s not receiving the more perfect doctrines.
Wherefore He commands not to open the doors to them; for indeed they
become more insolent after learning. For as to the well-disposed and
intelligent, things appear venerable when revealed, so to the
insensible, when they are unknown rather. “Since then from their
nature, they are not able to learn them, “let the thing be

are swine; even as when the pearl is trampled under foot, it is not so
trampled, because it is really contemptible, but because it fell among

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p73">For inasmuch as He had enjoined things great and
marvellous, and had commanded men to be superior to all their passions,
and had led them up to Heaven itself, and had enjoined them to strive
after the resemblance, not of angels and archangels, but (as far as was
possible) of the very Lord of all; and had bidden His disciples not
only themselves duly to perform all this, but also to correct others,
and to distinguish between the evil and them that are not such, the
dogs and them that are not dogs (although there be much that is hidden
in men):—that they might not say, “these things are
grievous and intolerable,” (for indeed in the sequel Peter did
utter some such things, saying, “Who can be saved?”<note n="1009" id="iii.XXIII-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p74"><scripRef passage="Matt. 19.25,10" id="iii.XXIII-p74.1" parsed="|Matt|19|25|0|0;|Matt|19|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.25 Bible:Matt.19.10">Matt. xix. 25, and 10</scripRef>.</p></note>and again, “If the case of the man be so, it is not good to
marry): in order therefore that they might not now likewise say so; as
in the first place even by what had gone before He had proved it all to
be easy, setting down many reasons one upon another, of power to
persuade men: so after all He adds also the pinnacle of all facility,
devising as no ordinary relief to our toils, the assistance derived
from persevering prayers. Thus, we are not ourselves, saith He, to
strive alone, but also to invoke the help from above: and it will
surely come and be present with us, and will aid us in our struggles,
and make all easy. Therefore He both commanded us to ask, and pledged
Himself to the giving.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p75">However, not simply to ask did He command us, but with
much assiduity and earnestness. For this is the meaning of
“seek.” For so he that seeks, putting all things out of his
mind, is taken up with that alone which is sought, and forms no idea of
any of the persons present. And this which I am saying they know, as
many as have lost either gold, or servants, and are seeking diligently
after them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p76">By “seeking,” then, He declared this; by
“knocking,” that we approach with earnestness and a glowing
mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p77">Despond not therefore, O man, nor show less of zeal
about virtue, than they do of desire for wealth. For things of that
kind thou hast often sought and not found, but nevertheless, though
thou know this, that thou art not sure to find them, thou puttest in
motion every mode of search; but here, although having a promise that
thou wilt surely receive, thou dost not show even the smallest part of
that earnestness. And if thou dost not receive straightway, do not even
thus despair. For to this end He said, “knock,” to signify
that even if He should not straightway open the door, we are to
continue there.</p>

His example.</p>

receive. For to this end was the door shut, that He may induce thee to

ask. Continue then to do these things, and thou wilt surely receive.

asking what he ought: “since ye too,” saith He,
“though ye be fathers, wait for your sons to ask: and if they
should ask of you anything inexpedient, ye refuse the gifts; just as,
if it be expedient, ye consent and bestow it.” Do thou too,
considering these things, not withdraw until thou receive; until thou
have found, retire not; relax not thy diligence, until the door be
opened. For if thou approach with this mind, and say, “Except I
receive, I depart not;” thou wilt surely receive, provided thou
ask such things, as are both suitable for Him of whom thou askest to
give, and expedient for thee the petitioner. But what are these? To
seek the things spiritual, all of them; to forgive them that have

“did He not say, what things we ought to ask”? Nay verily,
He hath mentioned them all in what precedes, and hath signified for
what things we ought to draw nigh. Say not then, “I drew nigh,

receive not, God who loves us so much as to surpass even fathers, to
surpass them as far as goodness doth this evil nature.</p>

And nowhere doth He set down the chief of all good things,
nor bring forward His own coming:—for He who thus made speed to
give up His Son to the slaughter, “how shall He not freely give
us all things?”—because it had not yet come to pass. But
Paul indeed sets it forth, thus saying, “He that spared not His

confidence in prayer, while neglecting our own doings; nor, when taking
pains, trust only to our own endeavors; but both to seek after the help
from above, and contribute withal our own part; He sets forth the one
in connection with the other. For so after much exhortation, He taught
also how to pray, and when He had taught how to pray, He proceeded
again to His exhortation concerning what we are to do; then from that
again to the necessity of praying continually, saying,
“Ask,” and “seek,” and “knock.” And
thence again, to the necessity of being also diligent ourselves.</p>

say, “But how is it possible? He is God and I am man:” but,

great.</p>

doth He here say it is strait and confined? In the first place, if thou
attend, even here He points to it as very light, and easy, and
accessible. “And how,” it may be said, “is the narrow
and confined way easy?” Because it is a way and a gate; even as
also the other, though it be wide, though spacious, is also a way and a
gate. And of these there is nothing permanent, but all things are
passing away, both the pains and the good things of life.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p111">And not only herein is the part of virtue easy, but also
by the end again it becomes yet easier. For not the passing away of our
labors and toils, but also their issuing in a good end (for they end in
life) is enough to console those in conflict. So that both the
temporary nature of our labors, and the perpetuity of our crowns, and
the fact that the labors come first, and the crowns after, must prove a
very great relief in our toils. Wherefore Paul also called their
affliction “light”; not from the nature of the events, but
because of the mind of the combatants, and the hope of the future.
“For our light affliction,” saith he, “worketh an
eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are
seen, but at the things which are not seen.”<note n="1024" id="iii.XXIII-p111.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p112"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 17, 18" id="iii.XXIII-p112.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|17|4|18" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.17-2Cor.4.18">2 Cor. iv.

of those rewards which are temporary and perishing; much more when
heaven is set forth, and the unspeakable blessings, and the eternal
rewards, will no one feel any of the present hardships. Or if any
account it, even thus, to be toilsome, the suspicion comes of nothing
but their own remissness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p113">See, at any rate, how He on another side also makes it
easy, commanding not to hold intercourse with the dogs, nor to give
one’s self over to the swine, and to “beware of the false
prophets;” thus on all accounts causing men to feel as if in real
conflict. And the very fact too of calling it narrow contributed very
greatly towards making it easy; for it wrought on them to be vigilant.
As Paul then, when he saith, “We wrestle not against flesh and
blood,”<note n="1025" id="iii.XXIII-p113.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p114"><scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 12" id="iii.XXIII-p114.1" parsed="|Eph|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.12">Eph. vi.

wrestling is not,” etc.—R.]</p></note>doth so not to cast down, but to rouse up the spirits of the soldiers:
even so He also, to shake the travellers out of their sleep, called the
way rough. And not in this way only did He work upon men, to be
vigilant, but also by adding, that it contains likewise many to
supplant them; and, what is yet more grievous, they do not even attack
openly, but hiding themselves; for such is the race of the false
prophets. “But look not to this,” saith He, “that it
is rough and narrow, but where it ends; nor that the opposite is wide
and spacious, but where it issues.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p115">And all these things He saith, thoroughly to awaken our
alacrity; even as elsewhere also He said, “Violent men take it by
force.”<note n="1026" id="iii.XXIII-p115.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p116"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 12" id="iii.XXIII-p116.1" parsed="|Matt|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.12">Matt. xi.

hearers not to regard the felicities of the many, but the labors of the
few. For the more part, saith He, so far from walking this way, do not
so much as make it their choice: a thing of most extreme criminality.

conspiracy, far more grievous than that. For those are acknowledged and
open, but these shaded over. For which cause also, while from those He
commanded to hold off, these He charged men to watch with exact care,
as though it were not possible to see them at the first approach.
Wherefore He also said, “beware”; making us more exact to
discern them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p130">Then, lest when they had heard that it was narrow and
strait, and that they must walk on a way opposite to the many, and must
keep themselves from swine and dogs, and together with these from
another more wicked kind, even this of wolves; lest, I say, they should
sink down at this multitude of vexations, having both to go a way
contrary to most men, and therewith again to have such anxiety about
these things: He reminded them of what took place in the days of their
fathers, by using the term, “false prophets,” for then also
no less did such things happen. Be not now, I pray you, troubled (so He
speaks), for nothing new nor strange is to befall you. Since for all
truth the devil is always secretly substituting its appropriate
deceit.</p>

easily convicted.” Thus, inasmuch as He had said, “there be
few that find it,” He clears them out again from among those, who

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p140">And see His gentleness: how He said not, “Punish
them,” but, “Be not hurt by them,” “Do not fall
amongst them unguarded.” Then that thou mightest not say,
“it is impossible to distinguish that sort of men,” again
He states an argument from a human example, thus saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p141">“Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of
thistles? even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but the

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p143">Now what He saith is like this: they have nothing gentle
nor sweet; it is the sheep only so far as the skin; wherefore also it
is easy to discern them. And lest thou shouldest have any the least
doubt, He compares it to certain natural necessities, in matters which
admit of no result but one. In which sense Paul also said, “The
carnal mind is death; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can be.”<note n="1035" id="iii.XXIII-p143.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p144"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 6, 7" id="iii.XXIII-p144.1" parsed="|Rom|8|6|8|7" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.6-Rom.8.7">Rom. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p145">And if He states the same thing twice, it is not
tautology. But, lest any one should say, “Though the evil tree
bear evil fruit, it bears also good, and makes the distinction
difficult, the crop being twofold:” “This is not so,”
saith He, “for it bears evil fruit only, and

<pb n="161" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_161.html" id="iii.XXIII-Page_161" />

never can bear good: as indeed in the contrary
case also.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p146">“What then? Is there no such thing as a good man
becoming wicked? And the contrary again takes place, and life abounds
with many such examples.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p147">But Christ saith not this, that for the wicked there is
no way to change, or that the good cannot fall away, but that so long
as he is living in wickedness, he will not be able to bear good fruit.
For he may indeed change to virtue, being evil; but while continuing in
wickedness, he will not bear good fruit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p148">What then? did not David, being good, bear evil fruit?
Not continuing good, but being changed; since, undoubtedly, had he
remained always what he was, he would not have brought forth such
fruit. For not surely while abiding in the habit of virtue, did he
commit what he committed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p149">Now by these words He was also stopping the mouths of
those who speak evil at random, and putting a bridle on the lips of all
calumniators. I mean, whereas many suspect the good by reason of the
bad, He by this saying hath deprived them of all excuse. “For
thou canst not say, ‘I am deceived and beguiled;’ since I
have given thee exactly this way of distinguishing them by their works,
having added the injunction to go to their actions, and not to confound
all at random.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p150">9. Then forasmuch as He had not commanded to punish, but
only to beware of them, He, at once both to comfort those whom they
vex, and to alarm and change them, set up as a bulwark against<note n="1036" id="iii.XXIII-p150.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p151"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIII-p151.1">ἐπετεχισεν

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p154">Then, to make the saying less grievous, He added,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p155">“Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
them.”<note n="1038" id="iii.XXIII-p155.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p156"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 20" id="iii.XXIII-p156.1" parsed="|Matt|7|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.20">Matt. vii.

variation from the New Testament text.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p157">That He might not seem to introduce the threatening as
His leading topic, but to be stirring up their mind in the way of
admonition and counsel.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p158">Here He seems to me to be hinting at the Jews also, who
were exhibiting such fruits. Wherefore also He reminded them of the
sayings of John, in the very same terms delineating their punishment.
For he too said the very same, making mention to them of an
“axe,” and of a “tree cut down,” and of
“unquenchable fire.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p159">And though it appear indeed to be some single judgment,
the being burnt up, yet if one examine carefully, these are two
punishments. For he that is burnt is also cast of course out of
God’s kingdom; and this latter punishment is more grievous than
the other. Now I know indeed that many tremble only at hell, but I
affirm the loss of that glory to be a far greater punishment than hell.
And if it be not possible to exhibit it such in words, this is nothing
marvellous. For neither do we know the blessedness of those good
things, that we should on the other hand clearly perceive the
wretchedness ensuing on being deprived of them; since Paul, as knowing
these things clearly, is aware, that to fall from Christ’s glory
is more grievous than all. And this we shall know at that time, when we
shall fall into the actual trial of it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p160">But may this never be our case, O thou only-begotten Son
of God, neither may we ever have any experience of this irremediable
punishment. For how great an evil it is to fall from those good things,
cannot indeed be accurately told: nevertheless, as I may be able, I
will labor and strive by an example to make it clear to you, though it
be but in some small degree.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p161">Let us then imagine a wondrous child, having besides His
virtue the dominion of the whole world, and in all respects so
virtuous, as to be capable of bringing all men to the yearning of a
father’s affection. What theft do you think the father of this
child would not gladly suffer, not to be cast out of His society? And
what evil, small or great, would he not welcome, on condition of seeing
and enjoying Him? Now let us reason just so with respect to that glory
also. For no child, be he never so virtuous, is so desirable and lovely
to a father, as the having our portion in those good things, and
“to depart and be with Christ.”<note n="1039" id="iii.XXIII-p161.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p162"><scripRef passage="Phil. i. 23" id="iii.XXIII-p162.1" parsed="|Phil|1|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.23">Phil. i.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p163">No doubt hell, and that punishment, is a thing not to be
borne. Yet though one suppose ten thousand hells, he will utter nothing

face of mildness turning away from us, and that eye of peace not
enduring to look upon us. For if He, while I was an enemy, and hating
Him, and turning from Him, did in such wise follow after me, as not to
spare even Himself, but to give

<pb n="162" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_162.html" id="iii.XXIII-Page_162" />

Himself up unto death: when after all this I do not
vouchsafe to Him so much as a loaf in His hunger, with what kind of
eyes shall I ever again behold Him?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p166">But mark even here His gentleness; in that He doth not
at all speak of His benefits, nor say, “Thou hast despised Him
that hath done thee so much good:” neither doth He say,
“Me, who brought thee from that which is not into being, who
breathed into thee a soul, and set thee over all things on earth, who
for thy sake made earth, and heaven, and sea, and air, and all things
that are, who had been dishonored by thee, yea accounted of less honor
than the devil, and did not even so withdraw Himself, but had
innumerable thoughts for thee after it all; who chose to become a
slave, who was beaten with rods and spit upon, who was slain, who died
the most shameful death, who also on high makes intercession for thee,
who freely gives thee His Spirit, who vouchsafes to thee a kingdom, who
makes thee such promises, whose will it is to be unto thee Head, and
Bridegroom, and Garment, and House, and Root, and Meat, and Drink, and
Shepherd, and King, and who hath taken thee to be brother, and heir,
and joint-heir with Himself; who hath brought thee out of darkness into
the dominion of light.” These things, I say, and more than these
He might speak of, but He mentions none of these; but what? only the
sin itself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p167">Even here He shows His love, and indicates the yearning
which He hath toward thee: not saying, “Depart into the fire
prepared for you,” but “prepared for the devil.” And
before He tells them what wrongs they had done, and neither so doth He
endure to mention all, but a few. And before these He calls the other
sort, those who have done well, to signify from this too that He is
blaming them justly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p168">What amount of punishment, then, is so grievous as these
words? For if any one seeing but a man who was his benefactor an
hungered, would not neglect him; or if he should neglect him, being
upbraided with it, would choose rather to sink into the earth than to
hear of it in the presence of two or three friends; what will be our
feelings, on hearing these words in the presence of the whole world;
such as He would not say even then, were He not earnestly accounting
for His own doings? For that not to upbraid did He bring these things
forward, but in self-defense, and for the sake of showing, that not
without ground nor at random was He saying, “depart from
me;” this is evident from His unspeakable benefits. For if He had
been minded to upbraid, He would have brought forwards all these, but
now He mentions only what treatment He had received.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p169">10. Let us therefore, beloved, fear the hearing these
words. Life is not a plaything: or rather our present life is a
plaything, but the things to come are not such; or perchance our life
is not a plaything only, but even worse than this. For it ends not in
laughter, but rather brings exceeding damage on them who are not minded
to order their own ways strictly. For what, I pray thee, is the
difference between children who are playing at building houses, and us
when we are building our fine houses? what again between them making
out their dinners, and us in our delicate fare? None, but just that we
do it at the risk of being punished. And if we do not yet quite
perceive the poverty of what is going on, no wonder, for we are not yet
become men; but when we are become so, we shall know that all these
things are childish.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p170">For so those other things too, as we grow to manhood, we
laugh to scorn; but when we are children we account them to be worth
anxiety; and while we are gathering together potsherds and mire we
think no less of ourselves than they who are erecting their great
circuits of walls. Nevertheless they straightway perish and fall down,
and not even when standing can they be of any use to us, as indeed
neither can those fine houses. For the citizen of Heaven they cannot
receive, neither can he bear to abide in them, who hath his country
above; but as we throw down these with our feet, so he too those by his
high spirit. And as we laugh at the children, weeping at that
overthrow, even so these also, when we are bewailing it all, do not
laugh only, but weep also: because both their bowels are compassionate,
and great is the mischief thence arising.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p171">Let us therefore become men. How long are we to crawl on
the earth, priding ourselves on stones and stocks? How long are we to
play? And would we played only! But now we even betray our own
salvation; and as children when they neglect their learning, and
practise themselves in these things at their leisure, suffer very
severe blows; even so we too, spending all our diligence herein, and
having then our spiritual lessons required of us in our works, and not
being able to produce them, shall have to pay the utmost penalty. And
there is none to deliver us; though he be father, brother, what you
will. But while these things shall all pass away, the torment ensuing
upon them remains immortal and unceasing; which sort of thing indeed
takes place with respect to the

<pb n="163" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_163.html" id="iii.XXIII-Page_163" />

children as well, their father destroying their childish
toys altogether for their idleness, and causing them to weep
incessantly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p172">11. And to convince thee that these things are such, let
us bring before us wealth, that which more than anything seems to be
worthy of our pains, and let us set against it a virtue of the soul
(which soever thou wilt), and then shalt thou see most clearly the
vileness thereof. Let us, I say, suppose there are two men (and I do
not now speak of injuriousness,<note n="1042" id="iii.XXIII-p172.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIII-p173">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIII-p173.1">πλεονεξα</span>.]</p></note>but as yet of honest wealth); and of these two, let the one get
together money, and sail on the sea, and till the land, and find many
other ways of merchandise (although I know not quite, whether, so
doing, he can make honest gains); nevertheless let it be so, and let it
be granted that his gains are gotten with honesty; that he buys fields,
and slaves, and all such things, and suppose no injustice connected
therewith. But let the other one, possessing as much, sell fields, sell
houses, and vessels of gold and silver, and give to the poor; let him
supply the necessitous, heal the sick, free such as are in straits,
some let him deliver from bonds, others let him release that are in
mines, these let him bring back from the noose, those, who are
captives, let him rescue from their punishment. Of whose side then
would you be? And we have not as yet spoken of the future, but as yet
of what is here. Of whose part then would ye be? his that is gathering
gold, or his that is doing away with calamities? with him that is
purchasing fields, or him who is making himself a harbor of refuge for
the human race? him that is clothed with much gold, or him that is
crowned with innumerable blessings? Is not the one like some angel come
down from Heaven for the amendment of the rest of mankind; but the
other not so much as like a man, but like some little child that is
gathering all together vainly and at random?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p174">But if to get money honestly be thus absurd, and of
extreme madness; when not even the honesty is there, how can such a man
choose but be more wretched than any? I say, if the absurdity be so
great; when hell is added thereto, and the loss of the kingdom, how
great wailings are due to him, both living and dead?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p175">12. Or wilt thou that we take in hand some other part
also of virtue? Let us then introduce again another man, who is in
power, commanding all, invested with great dignity, having a gorgeous
herald, and girdle, and lictors, and a large company of attendants.
Doth not this seem great, and meet to be called happy? Well then,
against this man again let us set another, him that is patient of
injuries, and meek, and lowly, and long suffering; and let this last be
despitefully used, be beaten, and let him bear it quietly, and bless
them that are doing such things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p176">Now which is the one to be admired, I pray thee? He that
is puffed up, and inflamed, or he that is self-subdued? Is not the one
again like the powers above, that are so free from passion, but the
other like a blown bladder, or a man who hath the dropsy, and great
inflammation? The one like a spiritual physician, the other, a
ridiculous child that is puffing out his cheeks?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p177">For why dost thou pride thyself, O man? Because thou art
borne on high in a chariot? Because a yoke of mules is drawing thee?
And what is this? Why, this one may see befalling mere logs of wood and
stones. Is it that thou art clothed with beautiful garments? But look
at him that is clad with virtue for garments, and thou wilt see thyself
to be like withering hay, but him like a tree that bears marvellous
fruit, and affords much delight to the beholders. For thou art bearing
about food for worms and moths, who, if they should set upon thee, will
quickly strip thee bare of this adorning (for truly garments and gold
and silver, are the one, the spinning of worms; the other earth and
dust, and again become earth and nothing more): but he that is clothed
with virtue hath such raiment, as not only worms cannot hurt, but not
even death itself. And very naturally; for these virtues of the soul
have not their origin from the earth, but are a fruit of the Spirit;
wherefore neither are they subject to the mouths of worms. Nay, for
these garments are woven in Heaven, where is neither moth, nor worm,
nor any other such thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p178">Which then is better, tell me? To be rich, or to be
poor? To be in power, or in dishonor? In luxury, or in hunger? It is
quite clear; to be in honor, and enjoyment, and wealth. Therefore, if
thou wouldest have the things and not the names, leave the earth and
what is here, and find thee a place to anchor in Heaven: for what is
here is a shadow, but all things there are immovable, stedfast, and
beyond any assault.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIII-p179">Let us therefore choose them with all diligent care,
that we may be delivered from the turmoil of the things here, and
having sailed into that calm harbor, may be found with our lading
abundant, and with that unspeakable wealth of almsgiving; unto which
God grant we may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the might, world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p6">And here He seems to me to be censuring the Jews

taking no care of practice. For which Paul also blames them, saying,

had a gift. And in the Old Testament also this may be found, in that
grace hath oftentimes wrought upon unworthy persons, that it might do
good to others. That is, since all men were not meet for all things,
but some were of a pure life, not having so great faith, and others
just the contrary; by these sayings, while He urges the one to show
forth much faith, the others too He was summoning by this His
unspeakable gift to become better men. Wherefore also with great
abundance did He bestow that grace. For “we wrought,” it is
said, “many mighty works.” But “then will I profess
unto them, I knew you not.” For “now indeed they suppose
they are my friends; but then shall they know, that not as to friends
did I give to them.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p9">And why marvel if He hath bestowed gifts on men that
have believed on Him, though without life suitable to their faith, when
even on those who have fallen from both these, He is unquestionably
found working? For so Balaam was an alien both from faith and from a
truly good life; nevertheless grace wrought on him for the service<note n="1046" id="iii.XXIV-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p10"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIV-p10.1">οκονομαν</span>.</p></note>of other men. And Pharaoh too was of the same sort: yet for all that
even to him He signified the things to come. And Nebuchadnezzar was
very full of iniquity; yet to him again He revealed what was to follow
after many generations.<note n="1047" id="iii.XXIV-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p11"><scripRef passage="Dan. iii" id="iii.XXIV-p11.1" parsed="|Dan|3|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3">Dan.

place, and it was requisite that the manifestation of its power should
be abundant, many even of the unworthy used to receive gifts. Howbeit,
from those miracles no gain accrued to them; rather they are the more
punished. Wherefore unto them did He utter even that fearful saying,
“I never knew you:” there being many for whom His hatred
begins already even here; whom He turns away from, even before the
judgment.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p13">Let us fear therefore, beloved; and let us take great
heed to our life, neither let us account ourselves worse off, in that
we do not work miracles now. For that will never be any advantage to
us, as neither any disadvantage in our not working them, if we take
heed to all virtue. Because for the miracles we ourselves are debtors,
but for our life and our doings we have God our debtor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p14">3. Having now, you see, finished all, having discoursed
accurately of all virtue, and pointed out the pretenders to it, of
divers kinds, both such as for display fast and make prayers, and such
as come in the sheep’s hide; and them too that spoil it, whom He
also called swine and dogs: He proceeds to signify how great is the
profit of virtue even here, and how great the mischief of wickedness,
by saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p15">“Whosoever therefore heareth these sayings of
mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man.”<note n="1049" id="iii.XXIV-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 24" id="iii.XXIV-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|7|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.24">Matt. vii.

therefore which beareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be
likened.” The Greek text in the Homily is identical with that
accepted in the R.V.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p17">As thus: What they shall suffer who do not (although
they work miracles), ye have heard; but ye should know also what such
as obey all these sayings shall enjoy; not in the world to come only,
but even here. “For whosoever,” saith He, “heareth
these sayings of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened to a wise
man.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p18">Seest thou how He varies His discourse; at one time
saying, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,” and
revealing Himself; at another time, “He that doeth the will of my
Father;” and again, bringing in Himself as judge, “For many
will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy
name, and I will say, I know you not.” And here again He
indicates Himself to have the power over all, this being why He said,
“Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine.”</p>

<pb n="165" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_165.html" id="iii.XXIV-Page_165" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p19">Thus whereas all His discourse had been touching the
future; of a kingdom, and an unspeakable reward and consolation, and
the like; His will is, out of things here also to give them their
fruits, and to signify how great is the strength of virtue even in the
present life. What then is this her strength? To live in safety, to be
easily subdued by no terror, to stand superior to all that despitefully
use us. To this what can be equal? For this, not even he that wears the
diadem can provide for himself, but that man who follows after virtue.
For he alone is possessed of it in full abundance: in the ebb and
flow<note n="1050" id="iii.XXIV-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p20">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIV-p20.1">ερπ</span>, a
strait, where the ebb and flow is great and frequent. See Liddell and
Scott, <i>Greek Lexicon</i>.—R.]</p></note>of the things present he enjoys a great calm. The truly marvellous
thing being this, that not in fair weather, but when the storm is
vehement, and the turmoil great, and the temptations continual, he
cannot be shaken ever so little.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p21">“For the rain descended,” saith He,
“the floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and
it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.”<note n="1051" id="iii.XXIV-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 25" id="iii.XXIV-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.25">Matt. vii.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p23">By “rain” here, and “floods,”
and “winds,” He is expressing metaphorically the calamities
and afflictions that befall men; such as false accusations, plots,
bereavements, deaths, loss of friends, vexations from strangers, all
the ills in our life that any one could mention. “But to none of
these,” saith He, “doth such a soul give way; and the cause
is, it is founded on the rock.” He calls the stedfastness of His
doctrine a rock; because in truth His commands are stronger than any
rock, setting one above all the waves of human affairs. For he who
keeps these things strictly, will not have the advantage of men only
when they are vexing him, but even of the very devils plotting against
him. And that it is not vain boasting so to speak, Job is our witness,
who received all the assaults of the devil, and stood unmoveable; and
the apostles too are our witnesses, for that when the waves of the
whole world were beating against them, when both nations and princes,
both their own people and strangers, both the evil spirits, and the
devil, and every engine was set in motion, they stood firmer than a
rock, and dispersed it all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p24">And now, what can be happier than this kind of life? For
this, not wealth, not strength of body, not glory, not power, nor ought
else will be able to secure, but only the possession of virtue. For
there is not, nay there is not another life we may find free from all
evils, but this alone. And ye are witnesses, who know the plots in
king’s courts, the turmoils and the troubles in the houses of the
rich. But there was not among the apostles any such thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p25">What then? Did no such thing befall them? Did they
suffer no evil at any man’s hand? Nay, the marvel is this above
all things, that they were indeed the object of many plots, and many
storms burst upon them, but their soul was not overset by them, nor
thrown into despair, but with naked bodies they wrestled, prevailed,
and triumphed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p26">Thou then likewise, if thou be willing to perform these
things exactly, shall laugh all ills to scorn. Yea, for if thou be but
strengthened with such philosophy as is in these admonitions, nothing
shall be able to hurt thee. Since in what is he to harm thee, who is
minded to lay plots? Will he take away thy money? Well, but before
their threatening thou wast commanded to despise it, and to abstain
from it so exceedingly, as not so much as even to ask any such thing of
thy Lord. But doth he cast thee into prison? Why, before thy prison,
thou wast enjoined so to live, as to be crucified even to all the
world. But doth he speak evil? Nay, from this pain also Christ hath
delivered thee, by promising thee without toil a great reward for the
endurance of evil, and making thee so clear from the anger and vexation
hence arising, as even to command thee to pray for them. But doth he
banish thee and involve thee in innumerable ills? Well, he is making
the crown more glorious for thee. But doth he destroy and murder thee?
Even hereby he profits thee very greatly, procuring for thee the
rewards of the martyrs, and conducting thee more quickly into the
untroubled haven, and affording thee matter for a more abundant
recompence, and contriving for thee to make a gain of the universal
penalty.<note n="1052" id="iii.XXIV-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p27"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIV-p27.1">τν

[The verb means “to engage in business,” and it is an easy
transition to the successful result of trading. The Latin rendering of
Montfaucon is: <i><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIV-p27.2">ac tibi providens, ut a communi illa
reddenda ratione te expedias</span></i> —R.]</p></note> Which thing indeed is most marvellous of all, that the plotters, so far
from injuring at all, do rather make the objects of their despite more
approved. To this what can be comparable? I mean, to the choice of such
a mode of life as this, and no other, is.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p28">Thus whereas He had called the way strait and narrow; to
soothe our labors on this side also, He signifies the security thereof
to be great, and great the pleasure; even as of the opposite course
great is the unsoundness, and

<pb n="166" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_166.html" id="iii.XXIV-Page_166" />

the
detriment. For as virtue even from things here was signified by Him to
have her rewards, so vice also her penalties. For what I am ever
saying, that I will say now also: that in both ways He is everywhere
bringing about the salvation of His hearers on the one hand by zeal for
virtue, on the other by hatred of vice. Thus, because there would be
some to admire what He said, while they yield no proof of it by their
works, He by anticipation awakens their fears, saying, Though the
things spoken be good, hearing is not sufficient for security, but
there is need also of obedience in actions, and the whole lies chiefly
in this. And here He ends His discourse, leaving the fear at its height
in them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p29">For as with regard to virtue, not only from the things
to come did He urge them (speaking of a kingdom, and of Heaven, and an
unspeakable reward, and comfort, and the unnumbered good things): but
also from the things present, indicating the firm and immoveable
quality of the Rock; so also with respect to wickedness, not from the
expected things only doth He excite their fears (as from the tree that
is cut down, and the unquenchable fire, and the not entering into the
kingdom, and from His saying, “I know you not”): but also
from the things present, the downfall, I mean, in what is said of the
house.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p30">4. Wherefore also He made His argument more expressive,
by trying its force<note n="1053" id="iii.XXIV-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p31"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIV-p31.1">γυμνζων</span>.</p></note>in a parable; for it was not the same thing to say, “The virtuous
man shall be impregnable, but the wicked easily subdued,” as to
suppose a rock, and a house, and rivers, and rain, and wind, and the
like.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p32">“And every one,” saith He, “that
heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to
a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand.”<note n="1054" id="iii.XXIV-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 26" id="iii.XXIV-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|7|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.26">Matt. vii.
26</scripRef>. [R.V., “these
words.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p34">And well did He call this man “foolish”: for
what can be more senseless than one building a house on the sand, and
while he submits to the labor, depriving himself of the fruit and
refreshment, and instead thereof undergoing punishment? For that they
too, who follow after wickedness, do labor, is surely manifest to every
one: since both the extortioner, and the adulterer, and the false
accuser, toil and weary themselves much to bring their wickedness to
effect; but so far from reaping any profit from these their labors,
they rather undergo great loss. For Paul too intimated this when he
said, “He that soweth to his flesh, shall of his flesh reap
corruption.”<note n="1055" id="iii.XXIV-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p35"><scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 8" id="iii.XXIV-p35.1" parsed="|Gal|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.8">Gal. vi.
8</scripRef>.</p></note> To this man are they like also, who build on the sand; as those that
are given up to fornication, to wantonness, to drunkenness, to anger,
to all the other things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p36">Such an one was Ahab, but not such Elijah (since when we
have put virtue and vice along side of one another, we shall know more
accurately the difference): for the one had built upon the rock, the
other on the sand; wherefore though he were a king, he feared and
trembled at the prophet, at him that had only his sheepskin. Such were
the Jews but not the apostles; and so though they were few and in
bonds, they exhibited the steadfastness of the rock; but those, many as
they were, and in armor, the weakness of the sand. For so they said,
“What shall we do to these men?”<note n="1056" id="iii.XXIV-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p37"><scripRef passage="Acts iv. 16" id="iii.XXIV-p37.1" parsed="|Acts|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.16">Acts iv.
16</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou those in perplexity, not who are in the hands of others, and
bound, but who are active in holding down and binding? And what can be
more strange than this? Hast thou hold of the other, and art yet in
utter perplexity? Yes, and very naturally. For inasmuch as they had
built all on the sand, therefore also were they weaker than all. For
this cause also they said again, “What do ye, seeking to bring
this man’s blood upon us?”<note n="1057" id="iii.XXIV-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p38"><scripRef passage="Acts v. 28" id="iii.XXIV-p38.1" parsed="|Acts|5|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.5.28">Acts v.
28</scripRef>.</p></note> What saith he? Dost thou scourge, and art thou in fear? entreatest thou
despitefully, and art in dismay? Dost thou judge, and yet tremble? So
feeble is wickedness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p39">But the Apostles not so, but how? “We cannot but
speak the things which we have seen and heard.”<note n="1058" id="iii.XXIV-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p40"><scripRef passage="Acts iv. 20" id="iii.XXIV-p40.1" parsed="|Acts|4|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.20">Acts iv.
20</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou a noble spirit? seest thou a rock laughing waves to scorn?
seest thou a house unshaken? And what is yet more marvellous; so far
from turning cowards themselves at the plots formed against them, they
even took more courage, and cast the others into greater anxiety. For
so he that smites adamant, is himself the one smitten; and he that
kicks against the pricks, is himself the one pricked, the one on whom
the severe wounds fall: and he who is forming plots against the
virtuous, is himself the one in jeopardy. For wickedness becomes so
much the weaker, the more it sets itself in array against virtue. And
as he who wraps up fire in a garment, extinguishes not the flame, but
consumes the garment; so he that is doing despite to virtuous men, and
oppressing them, and binding them, makes them more glorious, but
destroys himself.<note n="1059" id="iii.XXIV-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p41">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIV-p41.1">ἑαυτν δ

himself.”—R.]</p></note> For the more ills thou sufferest, living righteously, the stronger art
thou become; since the more we honor self-restraint, the less we need
anything; and the

<pb n="167" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_167.html" id="iii.XXIV-Page_167" />

less we need
anything, the stronger we grow, and the more above all. Such a one was
John; wherefore him no man pained, but he caused pain to Herod; so he
that had nothing prevailed against him that ruled; and he that wore a
diadem, and purple, and endless pomp, trembles, and is in fear of him
that is stripped of all, and not even when beheaded could he without
fear see his head. For that even after his death he had the terror of
him in full strength, hear what He saith, “This is John, whom I
slew.”<note n="1060" id="iii.XXIV-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 2; Luke ix. 9" id="iii.XXIV-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|14|2|0|0;|Luke|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.2 Bible:Luke.9.9">Matt. xiv.

but soothing his own terror, and persuading his troubled soul to call
to mind, that he himself slew him. So great is the force of virtue,
that even after death it is more powerful than the living. For this
same cause again, when he was living, they that possessed much wealth
came unto him, and said, “What shall we do?”<note n="1061" id="iii.XXIV-p42.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p43"><scripRef passage="Luke iii. 10, 14" id="iii.XXIV-p43.1" parsed="|Luke|3|10|0|0;|Luke|3|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.3.10 Bible:Luke.3.14">Luke iii.

sinks down, how it yields to calamities? how it is overthrown, though
it have the support of royalty, of number, of nobility? For them that
pursue it, it makes more senseless than all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p50">And it doth not merely fall, but with great calamity:
for “great indeed,” He saith, “was the fall of
it.” The risk not being of trifles, but of the soul, of the loss
of Heaven, and those immortal blessings. Or rather even before that
loss, no life so wretched as he must live that follows after this;
dwelling with continual despondencies, alarms, cares, anxieties; which
a certain wise man also was intimating when he said, “The wicked
fleeth, when no man is pursuing.”<note n="1066" id="iii.XXIV-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIV-p51"><scripRef passage="Prov. xxviii. 1" id="iii.XXIV-p51.1" parsed="|Prov|28|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.28.1">Prov.

enemies, their servants, such as know them, such as know them not; and
before their punishment, suffer extreme punishment here. And to declare
all this, Christ said, “And great was the fall of it;”
shutting up these good commandments with that suitable ending, and
persuading even by the things present the most unbelieving to flee from
vice.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p52">For although the argument from what is to come be
vaster, yet is this of more power to restrain the grosser sort, and to
withdraw them from wickedness. Wherefore also he ended with it, that
the profit thereof might make its abode in them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIV-p53">Conscious therefore of all these things, both the
present, and the future, let us flee from vice, let us emulate virtue,
that we may not labor fruitlessly and at random, but may both enjoy the
security here, and partake of the glory there: unto which God grant we
may all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XXV-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXV-p5.1">Yet</span> was it rather natural for
them to grieve at the unpleasantness of His sayings, and to shudder at
the loftiness of His injunctions; but now so great was the power of the
Teacher, that many of them were even caught thereby, and thrown into
very great admiration, and persuaded by reason of the sweetness of His
sayings, not even when He ceased to speak, to depart from Him at all
afterwards. For neither did the hearers depart, He having

<pb n="168" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_168.html" id="iii.XXV-Page_168" />

come down from the mountain, but even then the
whole auditory followed Him; so great a love for His sayings had He
instilled into them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p6">But they were astonished most of all at His authority.
For not with reference to another, like the prophet and Moses, did He
say what He said; but everywhere indicating Himself to be the person
that had the power of deciding. For so, when setting forth His laws, He
still kept adding, “But I say unto you.” And in reminding
them of that day, He declared Himself to be the judge, both by the
punishments, and by the honors.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p7">And yet it was likely that this too would disturb them.
For if, when they saw Him by His works showing forth His authority, the
scribes were for stoning and persecuting Him; while there were words
only to prove this, how was it other than likely for them to be
offended? and especially when at first setting out these things were
said, and before He had given proof of His own power? But however, they
felt nothing of this; for when the heart and mind is candid, it is
easily persuaded by the words of the truth. And this is just why one
sort, even when the miracles were proclaiming His power, were offended;
while the other on hearing mere words were persuaded and followed Him.
This, I would add, the evangelist too is intimating, when he saith,
“great multitudes followed Him,”<note n="1068" id="iii.XXV-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p8"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 1" id="iii.XXV-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|8|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.1">Matt. viii.
1</scripRef>.</p></note>not any of the rulers, nor of the scribes, but as many as were free
from vice, and had their judgment uncorrupted. And throughout the whole
gospel thou seest that such clave unto Him. For both while He spake,
they used to listen in silence, not making any intrusion, nor breaking
in upon the connexion of His sayings, nor tempting Him, and desiring to
find a handle like the Pharisees; and after His exhortation they
followed Him again, marvelling.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p9">But do thou mark, I pray thee, the Lord’s
consideration, how He varies the mode of profiting His hearers, after
miracles entering on words, and again from the instruction by His words
passing to miracles. Thus, both before they went up into the mountain,
He healed many, preparing the way for His sayings; and after finishing
that long discourse to the people, He comes again to miracles,
confirming what had been said by what was done. And so, because He was
teaching as “one having authority,” lest His so teaching
should be thought boasting and arrogant, He doth the very same in His
works also, as having authority to heal; that they might no more be
perplexed at seeing Him teach in this way, when He was working His
miracles also in the same.</p>

he did not interrupt the teaching, nor break through the auditory, but
awaited the proper time, and approaches Him “when He is come
down.” And not at random, but with much earnestness, and at His
knees, he beseeches Him,<note n="1070" id="iii.XXV-p11.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p12"><scripRef passage="Mark 1.40; Luke 5.12" id="iii.XXV-p12.1" parsed="|Mark|1|40|0|0;|Luke|5|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.1.40 Bible:Luke.5.12">Mark i. 40.

opinion about him. For neither did he say, “If Thou request it of
God,” nor, “If Thou pray,” but, “If Thou wilt,
Thou canst make me clean.” Nor did he say, “Lord, cleanse
me,” but leaves all to Him, and makes His recovery depend on Him,
and testifies that all the authority is His.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p13">“What then,” saith one, “if the
leper’s opinion was mistaken?” It were meet to do away with
it, and to reprove, and set it right. Did He then so do? By no means;
but quite on the contrary, He establishes and confirms what had been
said. For this cause, you see, neither did He say, “Be thou
cleansed,” but, “I will, be thou clean;” that the
doctrine might no longer be a thing of the other’s surmising, but
of His own approval.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p14">But the apostles not so: rather in what way? The whole
people being in amazement, they said, “Why give heed to us, as
though by our own power or authority we had made him to
walk?”<note n="1071" id="iii.XXV-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p15"><scripRef passage="Acts iii. 12" id="iii.XXV-p15.1" parsed="|Acts|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.3.12">Acts iii.

passage has been modified in the citation.—R.]</p></note> But the Lord, though He spake oftentimes many things modestly, and
beneath His own glory, what saith He here, to establish the doctrine of
them that were amazed at Him for His authority? “I will, be thou
clean.” Although in the many and great signs which He wrought, He
nowhere appears to have uttered this word. Here however, to confirm the
surmise both of all the people and of the leper touching His authority,
He purposely added, “I will.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p16">And it was not that He said this, but did it not; but
the work also followed immediately. Whereas, if he had not spoken well,
but the saying had been a blasphemy, the work ought to have been
interrupted. But now nature herself gave way at His command, and that
speedily, as was meet, even more speedily

than the evangelist hath said. For the word,
“immediately,” falls far short of the quickness that there
was in the work.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p17">But He did not merely say, “I will, be thou
clean,” but He also “put forth His hand, and touched
him;” a thing especially worthy of inquiry. For wherefore, when
cleansing him by will and word, did He add also the touch of His hand?
It seems to me, for no other end, but that He might signify by this
also, that He is not subject to the law, but is set over it; and that
to the clean, henceforth, nothing is unclean.<note n="1072" id="iii.XXV-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p18"><scripRef passage="Titus i. 15" id="iii.XXV-p18.1" parsed="|Titus|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Titus.1.15">Titus i.

though he perceived that he was offended at his not coming out and
touching him, observing the strictness of the law, he abides at home,
and sends him to Jordan to wash. Whereas the Lord, to signify that He
heals not as a servant, but as absolute master, doth also touch. For
His hand became not unclean from the leprosy, but the leprous body was
rendered clean by His holy hand.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p19">Because, as we know, He came not to heal bodies only,
but also to lead the soul unto self-command. As therefore He from that
time forward no more forbad to eat with unwashen hands, introducing
that excellent law, which relates to the indifference of meats; just so
in this case also, to instruct us for the future, that the soul must be
our care;—that leaving the outward purifications, we must wipe
that clean, and dread the leprosy thereof alone, which is sin (for to
be a leper is no hindrance to virtue):—He Himself first touches
the leper, and no man finds fault. For the tribunal was not corrupt,
neither were the spectators under the power of envy. Therefore, so far
from blaming, they were on the contrary astonished at the miracle, and
yielded thereto: and both for what He said, and for what He did, they
adored his uncontrollable power.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p20">3. Having therefore healed his body, He bids him,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p21">“Tell no man, but show himself to the priest, and
offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto
them.”<note n="1073" id="iii.XXV-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 4" id="iii.XXV-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.4">Matt. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p23">Now some say, that for this intent He bade him tell no
man, that they might practise no craft about the discerning of his
cure; a very foolish suspicion on their part. For He did not so cleanse
as to leave the cleansing questionable, but He bids him “tell no
man,” teaching us to avoid boasting and vainglory. And yet He
well knew that the other would not obey, but would proclaim his
benefactor: nevertheless He doth His own part.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p24">“How then elsewhere doth He bid them tell of
it?” one may ask. Not as jostling with or opposing Himself, but
as teaching men to be grateful. For neither in that place did He give
command to proclaim Himself, but to “give glory to
God;”<note n="1074" id="iii.XXV-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p25"><scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 18" id="iii.XXV-p25.1" parsed="|Luke|17|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.18">Luke xvii.

other to be thankful and grateful; and instructing on every occasion to
offer to the Lord the praise of all things that befall us. That is,
because men for the most part remember God in sickness, but grow
slacker after recovery; He bids them continually both in sickness and
in health to give heed to the Lord, in these words, “give glory
to God.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p26">But wherefore did He command him also to show himself to
the priest, and to offer a gift? To fulfill the law here again.<note n="1075" id="iii.XXV-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p27"><scripRef passage="Lev. xiv. 1-32" id="iii.XXV-p27.1" parsed="|Lev|14|1|14|32" osisRef="Bible:Lev.14.1-Lev.14.32">Lev. xiv.
1–32</scripRef>.</p></note> For neither did He in every instance set it aside, nor in every
instance keep it, but sometimes He did the one, sometimes the other; by
the one making way for the high rule<note n="1076" id="iii.XXV-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p28"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXV-p28.1">φιλοσοφ</span>.</p></note>of life that was to come, by the other checking for a while the
insolent speech of the Jews, and condescending to their infirmity. And
why marvel, if just at the beginning He Himself did this, when even the
very apostles, after they were commanded to depart unto the Gentiles,
after the doors were opened for their teaching throughout the world,
and the law shut up, and the commandments made new, and all the ancient
things had ceased, are found sometimes observing the law, sometimes
neglecting it?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p29">But what, it may be said, doth this saying, “Show
thyself to the priest,” contribute to the keeping of the law? No
little. Because it was an ancient law, that the leper when cleansed
should not entrust to himself the judgment of his cleansing, but should
show himself to the priest, and present the demonstration thereof to
his eyes, and by that sentence be numbered amongst the clean. For if
the priest said not “The leper is cleansed,” he remained
still with the unclean without the camp. Wherefore he saith,
“Show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
commanded.” He said not, “which I command,” but for a
time remits him to the law, by every means stopping their mouths. Thus,
lest they should say, He had seized upon the priests’ honor;
though He performed the work Himself, yet the approving it He entrusted
to them, and made them sit as judges of His own miracles. “Why, I

<pb n="170" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_170.html" id="iii.XXV-Page_170" />

am so far,” He saith,
“from striving either with Moses or with the priests, that I
guide the objects of my favor to submit themselves unto
them.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p30">But what is, “for a testimony unto them”?
For reproof, for demonstration, for accusation, if they be unthankful.
For since they said, as a deceiver and impostor we persecute Him, as an
adversary of God, and a transgressor of the law; “Thou shalt bear
me witness,” saith He, “at that time, that I am not a
transgressor of the law. Nay, for having healed thee, I remit thee to
the law, and to the approval of the priests;” which was the act
of one honoring the law, and admiring Moses, and not setting himself in
opposition to the ancient doctrines.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p31">And if they were not in fact to be the better, hereby
most of all one may perceive His respect for the law, that although He
foreknew they would reap no benefit, He fulfilled all His part. For
this very thing He did indeed foreknow, and foretold it: not saying,
“for their correction,” neither, “for their
instruction,” but, “for a testimony unto them,” that
is, for accusation, and for reproof, and for a witness that all hath
been done on my part; and though I foreknew they would continue
incorrigible, not even so did I omit what ought to be done; only they
continued keeping up to the end their own wickedness.<note n="1077" id="iii.XXV-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p32">[This interpretation is scarcely admissible, nor
does Chrysostom notice the disobedience of the healed man (<scripRef passage="Mark i. 45" id="iii.XXV-p32.1" parsed="|Mark|1|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.1.45">Mark i. 45</scripRef>). The “testimony” is that
commanded by Moses.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p33">This, we may observe, He saith elsewhere also;
“This gospel shall be preached in all the world for a testimony
to all the nations, and then shall the end come;”<note n="1078" id="iii.XXV-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 14" id="iii.XXV-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|24|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.14">Matt. xxiv.
14</scripRef>.</p></note>to the nations, to them that obey not, to them that believe not. Thus,
lest any one should say, “And wherefore preach to all, if all are
not to believe?”—it is that I may be found to have done all
my own part, and that no man may hereafter be able to find fault, as
though he had not heard. For the very preaching shall bear witness
against them, and they will not be able hereafter to say, “We
heard not;” for the word of godliness “hath gone out unto
the ends of the world.”<note n="1079" id="iii.XXV-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p35"><scripRef passage="Ps. xix. 4; Rom. x. 18" id="iii.XXV-p35.1" parsed="|Ps|19|4|0|0;|Rom|10|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.19.4 Bible:Rom.10.18">Ps. xix. 4;

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p36">4. Therefore bearing these things in mind, let us also
fulfill all our duties to our neighbor, and to God let us give thanks
continually. For it is too monstrous, enjoying as we do His bounty in
deed every day, not so much as in word to acknowledge the favor; and
this, though the acknowledgment again yield all its profit to us. Since
He needs not, be sure, anything of ours: but we stand in need of all
things from Him. Thus thanksgiving itself adds nothing to Him, but
causes us to be nearer to Him. For if men’s bounties, when we
call them to memory, do the more warm us with their proper
love-charm;<note n="1080" id="iii.XXV-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p37"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXV-p37.1">τ

our Lord towards us, shall we be more diligent in regard of His
commandments.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p38">For this cause Paul also said, “Be ye
thankful.”<note n="1081" id="iii.XXV-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p39"><scripRef passage="Col. iii. 15" id="iii.XXV-p39.1" parsed="|Col|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.15">Col. iii.

benefit, and a continual thanksgiving.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p40">For this cause even the awful mysteries, so full of that
great salvation, which are celebrated at every communion, are called a
sacrifice of thanksgiving,<note n="1082" id="iii.XXV-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p41"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXV-p41.1">εχαριστα</span>. [The
translator has paraphrased the passage. Literally, “which are at
every assembly (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXV-p41.2">σναξιν</span>), are called
Eucharist.” There is no suggestion of “sacrifice” in
the Greek at this point.—R.]</p></note>because they are the commemoration of many benefits, and they signify
the very sum of God’s care for us, and by all means they work
upon us to be thankful. For if His being born of a virgin was a great
miracle, and the evangelist said in amaze, “now all this was
done;” His being also slain, what place shall we find for that?
tell me. I mean, if to be born is called “all this;” to be
crucified, and to pour forth His blood, and to give Himself to us for a
spiritual feast and banquet,—what can that be called? Let us
therefore give Him thanks continually, and let this precede both our
words and our works.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p42">But let us be thankful not for our own blessings alone,
but also for those of others; for in this way we shall be able both to
destroy our envy, and to rivet our charity, and make it more genuine.
Since it will not even be possible for thee to go on envying them, in
behalf of whom thou givest thanks to the Lord.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p43">Wherefore, as you know, the priest also enjoins to give
thanks for the world, for the former things, for the things that are
now, for what hath been done to us before, for what shall befall us
hereafter, when that sacrifice<note n="1083" id="iii.XXV-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p44">[Here the word meaning “sacrifice” is
used.—R.]</p></note>is set forth.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p45">For this is the thing both to free us from earth, and to
remove us into heaven, and to make us angels instead of men. Because
they too form a choir, and give thanks to God for His good things
bestowed on us, saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will towards men.”<note n="1084" id="iii.XXV-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p46"><scripRef passage="Luke ii. 14" id="iii.XXV-p46.1" parsed="|Luke|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.2.14">Luke ii.

received text; but “among men” is the correct rendering
even of this reading.—R.]</p></note>“And what is this to us, that are not upon earth, nor are
men?” “Nay, it is very much to us, for we have been taught

ants, as
even to account their blessings ours.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p47">Wherefore Paul also, everywhere in his epistles, gives
thanks for God’s gracious acts to the world.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p48">Let us too therefore continually give thanks, for our
own blessings, and for those of others, alike for the small and for the
great. For though the gift be small, it is made great by being
God’s gift, or rather, there is nothing small that cometh from
Him, not only because it is bestowed by Him, but also in its very
nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p49">And to pass over all the rest, which exceed the sand in
multitude; what is equal to the dispensation<note n="1085" id="iii.XXV-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXV-p50.1">οκονομα</span>.</p></note>that hath taken place for our sake? In that what was more precious to
Him than all, even His only-begotten Son, Him He gave for us His
enemies; and not only gave, but after giving, did even set Him before
us as food;<note n="1086" id="iii.XXV-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p51"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXV-p51.1">τρπεζαν</span>, a table.</p></note> Himself doing all things that were for our good, both in giving Him,
and in making us thankful for all this. For because man is for the most
part unthankful, He doth Himself everywhere take in hand and bring
about what is for our good. And what He did with respect to the Jews,
by places, and times, and feasts, reminding them of His benefits, that
He did in this case also, by the manner of the sacrifice bringing us to
a perpetual remembrance of His bounty in these things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p52">No one hath so labored that we should be approved, and
great, and in all things right-minded, as the God who made us.
Wherefore both against our will He befriends us often, and without our
knowledge oftener than not. And if thou marvel at what I have said, I
point to this as having occurred not to any ordinary person, but to the
blessed Paul. For even that blessed man, when in much danger and
affliction, often besought God that the temptations might depart from
him: nevertheless God regarded not his request, but his profit, and to
signify this He said, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for my
strength is made perfect in weakness.”<note n="1087" id="iii.XXV-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p53"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9" id="iii.XXV-p53.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9">2 Cor. xii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> So that before He hath told him the reason, He benefits him against his
will, and without his knowing it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p54">5. Now what great thing doth He ask, in requiring us to
be thankful in return for such tender care? Let us then obey, and
everywhere keep up this. Since neither were the Jews by anything ruined
so much, as by being unthankful; those many stripes, one after another,
were brought upon them by nothing else than this; or rather even before
those stripes this had ruined and corrupted their soul. “For the
hope of the unthankful,” saith one, “is like the
winter’s hoar frost;”<note n="1088" id="iii.XXV-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p55"><scripRef passage="Wisdom xvi. 29" id="iii.XXV-p55.1" parsed="|Wis|16|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.16.29">Wisdom xvi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p56">And this springs from pride, and from thinking
one’s self worthy of something. But the contrite will acknowledge
grounds of thanksgiving to God, not for good things only, but also for
what seem to be adverse; and how much soever he may suffer, will count
none of his sufferings undeserved. Let us then also, the more we
advance in virtue, so much the more make ourselves contrite; for indeed
this, more than anything else is virtue. Because, as the sharper our
sight is, the more thoroughly do we learn how distant we are from the
sky; so the more we advance in virtue, so much the more are we
instructed in the difference between God and us. And this is no small
part of true wisdom,<note n="1089" id="iii.XXV-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p57"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXV-p57.1">φιλοσοφα</span>.</p></note>to be able to perceive our own desert. For he best knows himself, who
accounts himself to be nothing. Thus we see that both David and
Abraham, when they were come up to the highest pitch of virtue, then
best fulfilled this; and would call themselves, the one, “earth
and ashes,”<note n="1090" id="iii.XXV-p57.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXV-p58"><scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 27" id="iii.XXV-p58.1" parsed="|Gen|18|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.27">Gen. xviii.

So that he surely who is lifted up in boasting, is the very person to
be most ignorant of himself. Wherefore also in our common practice we
are wont to say of the proud, “he knows not himself,”
“he is ignorant of himself.” And he that knows not himself,
whom will he know? For as he that knows himself will know all things,
so he who knows not this, neither will he know the rest.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p62">Him therefore let us emulate and follow. And we shall
follow him, if we rid ourselves of earth, and of things on earth. For
nothing makes a man to be so ignorant of himself, as the being rivetted
to worldly concerns: nor does anything again so much cause men to be
rivetted to worldly concerns, as ignorance of one’s self: for
these things depend upon each other. I mean, that as he that is fond of
outward glory, and highly esteems

the things present, if he strive for ever, is
not permitted to understand himself; so he that overlooks these things
will easily know himself; and having come to the knowledge of himself,
he will proceed in order to all the other parts of virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXV-p63">In order therefore that we may learn this good
knowledge, let us, disengaged from all the perishable things that
kindle in us so great flame, and made aware of their vileness, show

<p class="c53" id="iii.XXVI-p3"><i>“And when He was entered into Capernaum, there
came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and saying, Lord, my servant
lieth at home</i><note n="1093" id="iii.XXVI-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p4">[R.V., “in the house.”]</p></note><i>sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.XXVI-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXVI-p5.1">The</span> leper came unto Him
“when He was come down from the mountain,” but this
centurion, “when He was entered into Capernaum.” Wherefore
then did neither the one nor the other go up into the mountain? Not out
of remissness, for indeed the faith of them both was fervent, but in
order not to interrupt His teaching.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p6">But having come unto Him, he saith, “My servant
lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.” Now some
say, that by way of excuse he mentioned also the cause, why he had not
brought him. “For neither was it possible,” saith he,
“paralyzed as he was, and tormented, and at his last gasp, to
lift and convey him.” For that he was at the point of expiring,
Luke saith; “He was even ready to die.”<note n="1094" id="iii.XXVI-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p7"><scripRef passage="Luke vii. 2" id="iii.XXVI-p7.1" parsed="|Luke|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.2">Luke vii.

than theirs, who let one down through the roof.<note n="1095" id="iii.XXVI-p7.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p8"><scripRef passage="Luke v. 19" id="iii.XXVI-p8.1" parsed="|Luke|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.5.19">Luke v.

for the raising up of the patient, he thought it superfluous to bring
him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p9">What then doth Jesus? What He had in no case done
before, here He doeth. For whereas on every occasion He was used to
follow the wish of His supplicants, here He rather springs toward it,
and offers not only to heal him, but also to come to the house. And
this He doth, that we might learn the virtue of the centurion. For if
He had not made this offer, but had said, “Go thy way, let thy
servant be healed;” we should have known none of these
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p10">This at least He did, in an opposite way, in the case
also of the Phœnician woman. For here, when not summoned to the
house, of His own accord He saith, He will come, that thou mightest
learn the centurion’s faith and great humility; but in the case
of the Phœnician woman, He both refuses the grant, and drives her,
persevering therein, to great perplexity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p11">For being a wise physician and full of resources, He
knows how to bring about contraries the one by the other.<note n="1096" id="iii.XXVI-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p12"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVI-p12.1">δι τν

hearken, and emulate, and receive Him with as great zeal; for indeed,
when thou receivest a poor man who is hungry and naked, thou hast

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p19">See this man also, how, like the leper, he hath the
right opinion touching Him. For neither did this one say,
“entreat,” nor did he say, “pray, and beseech,”
but “command only.” And then from fear lest out of modesty
He refuse, he saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p20">“For I also am a man under authority, having under
me soldiers; and I say to this man, go, and he goeth; and to another,
come, and he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doeth
it.”<note n="1101" id="iii.XXVI-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 4" id="iii.XXVI-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.4">Matt. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p22">“And what of that,” saith one, “if the
centurion did suspect it to be so? For the question is, whether Christ
affirmed and ratified as much.” Thou speakest well, and very
sensibly. Let us then look to this very thing; and we shall find what
happened in the case of the leper, the same happening here likewise.
For even as the leper said, “If thou wilt” (and not from
the leper only are we positive about His authority, but also from the
voice of Christ; in that, so far from putting an end to the suspicion,
He did even confirm it more, by adding what were else superfluous to
say, in the phrase, “I will, be thou cleansed,” in order to
establish that man’s doctrine): so here too, it is right to see
whether any such thing occurred. In fact, we shall find this same thing
again taking place. For when the centurion had spoken such words, and
had testified His so great prerogative; so far from blaming, He did
even approve it, and did somewhat more than approve it. For neither
hath the evangelist said, that He praised the saying only, but
declaring a certain earnestness in His praise, that He even
“marvelled;” and neither did He simply marvel, but in the
presence also of the whole people, and set Him as an example to the
rest, that they should emulate Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p23">Seest thou how each of them that bore witness of His
authority is “marvelled at? And the multitudes were astonished at
His doctrine, because He taught as one having authority;”<note n="1102" id="iii.XXVI-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 29" id="iii.XXVI-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|7|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.29">Matt. vii.

down, and by His words of cleansing to the leper, confirmed their
judgment. Again, that leper said, “If thou wilt, thou canst make
me clean;”<note n="1103" id="iii.XXVI-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p25"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 2" id="iii.XXVI-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|8|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.2">Matt. viii.

treatment as He had said. Again, this centurion saith, “Speak the

she had said, “Whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, He will give
Thee;” to lead her away from such a surmise, and to teach her
that He needs not to receive from another, but is Himself the fountain
of all good things, He saith, “I am the resurrection and the

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p33">Wherefore at the centurion He both marvels, and prefers
him to all the people, and honors him with the gift of the kingdom, and
provokes the rest to the same zeal. And to show thee that for this end
He so spake, <i>viz</i>. for the instructing of the rest to believe in
like manner, listen to the exactness of the evangelist, how he hath
intimated it. For,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p34">“Jesus,” saith he, “turned Him about,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p36">It follows, that to have high imaginations concerning
Him, this especially is of faith, and tends to procure the kingdom and
His other blessings. For neither did His praise reach to words only,
but He both restored the sick man whole, in recompence of his faith,
and weaves for him a glorious crown, and promises great gifts, saying
on this wise,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p37">“Many shall come from the east and west, and shall

talk with them more unreservedly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p40">Then, that no one might suppose His words to come of
flattery, but that all might be aware that such was the mind of the

the zealousness of the man, and his having had the right opinion
concerning Christ. But it is likely, that after sending his friends, he
himself also came and said these things. And if Luke did not speak of
the one, no more did Matthew of the other; and this is not the part of
men disagreeing amongst themselves, but rather of those that are
filling up the things omitted by one another. But see by another thing
also how Luke hath proclaimed his faith, saying that his servant
“was ready to die.”<note n="1114" id="iii.XXVI-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p45"><scripRef passage="Luke vii. 2" id="iii.XXVI-p45.1" parsed="|Luke|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.2">Luke vii.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> Nevertheless, not even this cast him into despondency, neither did it
cause him to give up: but even so he trusted that he should prevail.
And if Matthew affirm Christ to have said, “I have not found so
great faith, no, not in Israel,” and hereby to show clearly that
he was not an Israelite; while Luke saith, “He built our
synagogue;” neither is this a contradiction. For it was possible
for one, even though not a Jew, both to build the synagogue, and to
love the nation.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p46">4. But do not thou, I pray thee, merely inquire what was
said by him, but add thereto his rank also, and then thou wilt see the
man’s excellency. Because in truth great is the pride of them
that are in places of command, and not even in afflictions do they take

lower ground. He, for example, who
is set down in John, is for dragging Him unto his house, and saith,
“Come down, for my child is ready to die.”<note n="1115" id="iii.XXVI-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p47"><scripRef passage="John iv. 49" id="iii.XXVI-p47.1" parsed="|John|4|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.49">John iv.
49</scripRef>.</p></note> But not so this man; rather he is far superior both to him, and to
those who let down the bed through the roof. For he seeks not for His
bodily presence, neither did He bring the sick man near the physician;
a thing which implied no mean imaginations concerning Him, but rather a
suspicion of His divine dignity. And he saith, “speak the word
only.” And at the beginning he saith not even, “speak the
word,” but only describe his affliction: for neither did he, of
great humility, expect that Christ would straightway consent, and
inquire for his house. Therefore, when he heard Him say, “I will
come and heal him,” then, not before he saith, “speak the
word.” Nor yet did the suffering confound him, but still under
calamity he reasons coolly,<note n="1116" id="iii.XXVI-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p48"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVI-p48.1">φιλοσοφε</span>.</p></note>not looking so much to the health of the servant, as to the avoiding
all appearance of doing anything irreverent.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p49">And yet it was not he that pressed it, but Christ that
offered it: nevertheless even so he feared, lest perchance he should be
thought to be going beyond his own deservings, and to be drawing upon
himself a thing above his strength.<note n="1117" id="iii.XXVI-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVI-p50.1">βαρ
πργμα</span>.</p></note> Seest thou his wisdom? Mark the folly of the Jews, in saying, “He
was worthy for whom He should do the favor.”<note n="1118" id="iii.XXVI-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p51"><scripRef passage="Luke vii. 4" id="iii.XXVI-p51.1" parsed="|Luke|7|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.4">Luke vii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> For when they should have taken refuge in the love of Jesus towards
man, they rather allege this man’s worthiness; and know not so
much as on what ground to allege it. But not so he, but he affirmed
himself even in the utmost degree unworthy, not only of the benefit,
but even of receiving the Lord in his house. Wherefore even when he
said, “My servant lieth sick,” he did not add,
“speak,” for fear lest he should be unworthy to obtain the
gift; but he merely made known his affliction. And when he saw Christ
zealous in His turn, not even so did he spring forward, but still
continues to keep to the end his own proper measure.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p52">And if any one should say, “wherefore did not
Christ honor him in return?” we would say this, that He did make
return to him in honor, and that exceedingly: first by bringing out his
mind, which thing chiefly appeared by His not coming to his house; and
in the second place, by introducing him into His kingdom, and
preferring him to the whole Jewish nation. For because he made himself
out unworthy even to receive Christ into his house, he became worthy
both of a kingdom, and of attaining unto those good things which
Abraham enjoyed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p53">“But wherefore,” one may say, “was not
the leper commended, who showed forth things greater than these?”
For he did not so much as say, “speak the word,” but what
was far more, “be willing only,” which is what the prophet
saith concerning the Father, “He hath done whatsoever He
pleased.”<note n="1119" id="iii.XXVI-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p54"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxv. 3" id="iii.XXVI-p54.1" parsed="|Ps|15|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.15.3">Ps. cxv.
3</scripRef>.</p></note> But he also was commended. For when He said, “Offer the gift that
Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them,”<note n="1120" id="iii.XXVI-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p55"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 4" id="iii.XXVI-p55.1" parsed="|Matt|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.4">Matt. viii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> He means nothing else but, “thou shalt be an accuser of them, in
that thou didst believe.” And besides, it was not the same for
one that was a Jew to believe, and for one from without that nation.
For that the centurion was not a Jew is evident, both from his being a
centurion and from its being said, “I have not found so great
faith, no, not in Israel.” And it was a very great thing for a
man who was out of the list of the Jewish people to admit so great a
thought. For he did no less than imagine to himself, as it seems to me,
the armies in Heaven; or that the diseases and death, and everything
else, were so subject to Him, as his soldiers to himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p56">Wherefore he said likewise, “For I also am a man
set under authority;” that is, Thou art God, and I man; I under
authority, but Thou not under authority. If I therefore, being a man,
and under authority, can do so much; far more He, both as God, and as
not under authority. Thus with the strongest expression he desires to
convince Him, that he saith this, as one giving not a similar example,
but one far exceeding. For if I (said he), being equal in honor to them
whom I command, and under authority, yet by reason of the trifling
superiority of my rank am able to do such great things; and no man
contradicts me, but what I command, that is done, though the
injunctions be various (“for I say to this man, go, and he goeth;
and to another, come, and he cometh”:<note n="1121" id="iii.XXVI-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p57"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 9" id="iii.XXVI-p57.1" parsed="|Matt|8|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.9">Matt. viii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>) much more wilt Thou Thyself be able.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p58">And some actually read the place in this way, “For
if I, being a man,” and having inserted a stop, they add,
“having soldiers under authority under me.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p59">But mark thou, I pray thee, how he signified that Christ
is able both to overcome even death as a slave, and to command it as
its master. For in saying, “come, and he cometh,” and
“go, and he goeth;” he expresses this: “If Thou
shouldest command his end not to come upon him, it will not
come.”</p>

<pb n="176" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_176.html" id="iii.XXVI-Page_176" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p60">Seest thou how believing he was? For that which was
afterwards to be manifest to all, here is one who already hath made it
evident; that He hath power both of death and of life, and
“leadeth down to the gates of hell, and bringeth up
again.”<note n="1122" id="iii.XXVI-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p61"><scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxvi" id="iii.XXVI-p61.1" parsed="|1Sam|26|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.26">1 Sam.

to a more entire obedience.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p62">5. But nevertheless, though having such great faith, he
still accounted himself to be unworthy. Christ however, signifying that
he was worthy to have Him enter into his house, did much greater
things, marvelling at him, and proclaiming him, and giving more than he
had asked. For he came indeed seeking for his servant health of body,
but went away, having received a kingdom. Seest thou how the saying had
been already fulfilled, “Seek ye the kingdom of heaven, and all
these things shall be added unto you.”<note n="1123" id="iii.XXVI-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p63"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 33" id="iii.XXVI-p63.1" parsed="|Matt|6|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.33">Matt. vi.
33</scripRef>. [Comp. Hom. XXII. 4,
p.148, on the reading “kingdom of heaven.”—R.]</p></note> For, because he evinced great faith, and lowliness of mind, He both
gave him heaven, and added unto him health.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p64">And not by this alone did He honor him, but also by
signifying upon whose casting out he is brought in. For now from this
time forth He proceeds to make known to all, that salvation is by
faith, not by works of the law. And this is why not to Jews only, but
to Gentiles also the gift so given shall be proffered, and to the
latter rather than to the former. For “think not,” saith
He, “by any means, that so it hath come to pass in regard of this
man alone; nay, so it shall be in regard of the whole world. And this
He said, prophesying of the Gentiles, and suggesting to them good
hopes. For in fact there were some following Him from Galilee of the
Gentiles. And this He said, on the one hand, not letting the Gentiles
despair, on the other, putting down the proud spirits of the Jews.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p65">But that His saying might not affront<note n="1124" id="iii.XXVI-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p66"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVI-p66.1">προσστναι</span>,
“disagree with, be nauseous to.”</p></note>the hearers, nor afford them any handle; He neither brings forward
prominently what He hath to say of the Gentiles, but upon occasion
taken from the centurion; nor doth He use nakedly the term, Gentiles:
not saying, “many of the Gentiles,” but, “many from
east and west:”<note n="1125" id="iii.XXVI-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p67"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 11" id="iii.XXVI-p67.1" parsed="|Matt|8|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.11">Matt. viii.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>which was the language of one pointing out the Gentiles, but did not so
much affront the hearers, because His meaning was under a shadow.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p68">Neither in this way only doth He soften the apparent
novelty of His doctrine, but also by speaking of “Abraham’s
bosom” instead of “the kingdom.” For neither was that
term familiar to them:<note n="1126" id="iii.XXVI-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p69">[Both terms were current in Jewish theological
language; but it is implied in the argument that “Abraham’s
bosom” was not so well known, or so definitely
apprehended.—R.]</p></note>moreover, the introduction of Abraham would be a sharper sting to them.
Wherefore John also spake nothing at first concerning hell, but, what
was most apt to grieve them, He saith, “Think not to say, we are
children of Abraham.”<note n="1127" id="iii.XXVI-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p70"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 9" id="iii.XXVI-p70.1" parsed="|Matt|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.9">Matt. iii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p71">He is providing for another point also; not to seem in
any sense opposed to the ancient polity. For he that admires the
patriarchs, and speaks of their bosom as an inheritance of blessings,
doth much more than sufficiently remove also this suspicion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p72">Let no man therefore suppose that the threat is one
only, for both the punishment of the one and the joy of the other is
double: of the one, not only that they fell away, but that they fell
away from their own; of the other, not only that they attained, but
that they attained what they had no expectation of: and there is a
third together with these, that the one received what pertained to the
other. And he calls them “children of the kingdom,” for
whom the kingdom had been prepared: which also more than all was apt to
gall them; in that having pointed to them as being in their bosom by
His offer and promise, after all He puts them out.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p73">6. Then, because what He had said was mere affirmation,
He confirms it by the miracle; as indeed He shows the miracles in their
turn, by the subsequent accomplishment of the prediction. He
accordingly, who disbelieves the health which the servant then
received, let him from the prophecy, which hath this day come to pass,
believe that other also. For so that prophecy again, even before the
event, was made manifest to all by the sign which then took place. To
this end, you see, having first uttered that prediction, then and not
before He raised up the sick of the palsy; that He might make the
future credible by the present, and the less by the greater. Since for
virtuous men to enjoy His good things, and for the contrary sort to
undergo His penalties, were nothing improbable, but a reasonable event,
and according to the tenor of laws: but to brace up the feeble, and to
raise the dead, was something beyond nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p74">But nevertheless, unto this great and marvellous work
the centurion too contributed no little; which thing, we see, Christ
also declared, saying, “Go thy way, and as thou hast believed, so
be it done unto thee.” Seest thou how the health of the servant
proclaimed

<pb n="177" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_177.html" id="iii.XXVI-Page_177" />

aloud both
Christ’s power, and the faith of the centurion, and also became a
pledge of the future? Or rather it was all a proclamation of
Christ’s power. For not only did He quite heal the
servant’s body, but the soul also of the centurion He did Himself
bring over unto the faith by His miracles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p75">And do thou look not to this only, that the one
believed, and the other was healed, but marvel how quickly also. For
this too the evangelist declared, saying, “And his servant was
healed in the self-same hour:” even as of the leper also he said,
“he was straightway cleansed.” For not by healing, but by
doing so both in a wonderful manner and in a moment of time, did He
display His power. Neither in this way only doth He profit us, but also
by his constant practice, in the manifestation of His miracles, of
opening incidentally His discourses about His kingdom, and of drawing
all men towards it. For, those even whom He was threatening to cast
out, He threatened not in order to cast them out, but in order that
through such fear, He might draw them into it by His words. And if not
even hereby were they profited, theirs is the whole blame, as also of
all who are in the like distemper.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p76">For not at all among Jews only may one see this taking
place, but also among them that have believed. For Judas too was a
child of the kingdom, and it was said to him with the disciples,
“Ye shall sit on twelve thrones;”<note n="1128" id="iii.XXVI-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p77"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 28" id="iii.XXVI-p77.1" parsed="|Matt|19|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.28">Matt. xix.
28</scripRef>.</p></note>yet he became a child of hell; whereas the Ethiopian, barbarian as he
was, and of them “from the east and west,” shall enjoy the
crowns with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. This takes place among us
also now. “For many,” saith He, “that are first shall
be last, and the last first.”<note n="1129" id="iii.XXVI-p77.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p78"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 30" id="iii.XXVI-p78.1" parsed="|Matt|19|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.30">Matt. xix.
30</scripRef>.</p></note> And this He saith, that neither the one may grow languid, as unable to
return; nor the others be confident, as standing fast. This John also
declared before from the beginning, when he said, “God is able of
these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.”<note n="1130" id="iii.XXVI-p78.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p79"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 9" id="iii.XXVI-p79.1" parsed="|Matt|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.9">Matt. iii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> Thus, since it was so to come to pass, it is proclaimed long before;
that no one may be confounded at the strangeness of the event. But he
indeed speaks of it as a possible thing (for he was first); Christ on
the other hand as what will surely be, affording the proof of it from
His works.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p80">7. Let us not then be confident, who stand, but let us
say to ourselves, “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed
lest he fall;”<note n="1131" id="iii.XXVI-p80.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p81"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 12" id="iii.XXVI-p81.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.12">1 Cor. x.
12</scripRef>.</p></note>neither let us who are fallen despair, but let us say to ourselves,
“He that falleth, doth he not arise?”<note n="1132" id="iii.XXVI-p81.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p82"><scripRef passage="Jer. viii. 4" id="iii.XXVI-p82.1" parsed="|Jer|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.8.4">Jer. viii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> For many even who have mounted to the very summit of Heaven, and have
shown forth all austerity, and had made their abode in the deserts, nor
saw any woman so much as in a dream; having become a little remiss,
have been tripped up, and have come unto the very gulf of wickedness.
While others again from thence have gone up to Heaven, and from the
stage and orchestra have passed over unto the discipline of angels, and
have displayed so great virtue, as to drive away devils, and to work
many other such miracles. And of these examples both the Scriptures are
full, and our life is also full. Even whoremongers and effeminate
persons stop the mouths of the Manichæans, who say that wickedness
is immoveable, enrolling themselves on the devil’s side, and
weakening the hands of them that would wish to be in earnest, and
overturning all our life.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p83">For they who inculcate these things, not only injure men
as to the future, but here also turn all things upside down, for their
own part at least. Because when will any regard virtue, from among
those that are living in wickedness, so long as he accounts his return
that way, and his change for the better, a thing impossible? For if
now, when both laws exist, and penalties are threatened, and there is
common opinion to recall the ordinary sort, and hell is looked for, and
a kingdom promised, and wrong things reproached, and the good praised;
hardly do any choose the labors that are to be undergone for
virtue’s sake: shouldest thou take away all these things, what is
there to hinder ruin and corruption universal?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p84">Knowing therefore the devil’s craft, and that as
well the lawgivers of the Gentiles as the oracles of God, and the
reasonings of nature, and the common opinion of all men, yea
barbarians, and Scythians, and Thracians, and generally all, are
directly opposed both to these, and to such as strive to enact the
doctrines of fate: let us be sober, beloved, and bidding farewell to
all those, let us travel along the narrow way, being both confident and
in fear: in fear because of the precipices on either side, confident
because of Jesus our guide. Let us travel on, sober and wakeful. For
though but for a little while one slumber, he is swept away
quickly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p85">8. For we are not more perfect than David, who by a
little carelessness was hurled into the very gulf of sin. Yet he arose
again quickly. Look not then to his having sinned only, but also to his
having washed away his

<pb n="178" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_178.html" id="iii.XXVI-Page_178" />

sin. For to
this end He wrote that history, not that thou shouldest behold him
fallen, but admire him risen; to teach thee, when thou art fallen, how
thou shouldest arise. Thus, as physicians choose out the most grievous
diseases, and write them in their books, and teach their method of cure
in similar cases; if so be men having practised on the greater, may
easily master the less; even so God likewise hath brought forward the
greatest of sins, that they also who offend in small things may find
the cure of these easy, by means of the other: since if those admitted
of healing, much more the less.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p86">Let us look then to the manner both of the sickness, and
of the speedy recovery of that blessed man. What then was the manner of
his sickness? He committed adultery and murder. For I shrink not from
proclaiming these things with a loud voice. Since if the Holy Ghost
thought it no shame to record<note n="1133" id="iii.XXVI-p86.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p87"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVI-p87.1">ἀναθεναι</span>.</p></note>all this history, much less ought we to draw any shade over it.
Wherefore I not only proclaim it, but I add another circumstance also.
For in fact, whosoever hide these things, they most of all men throw
his virtue into the shade. And as they that say nothing of the battle
with Goliath deprive him of no small crowns, so also they that hurry by
this history. Doth not my saying seem a paradox? Nay, wait a little,
and then ye shall know that with reason have we said this. For to this
end do I magnify the sin, and make my statement stranger, that I may
the more abundantly provide the medicines.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p88">What is it then which I add? The man’s virtue;
which makes the fault also greater. For all things are not judged alike
in all men. “For mighty” men (it is said) “shall be
mightily tormented:”<note n="1134" id="iii.XXVI-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p89"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVI-p89.1">ἑτασθσονται</span>.
<scripRef passage="Wisdom vi. 6" id="iii.XXVI-p89.2" parsed="|Wis|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.6.6">Wisdom vi. 6</scripRef>.</p></note>and “He that knew his Lord’s will, and doeth it not, shall
be beaten with many stripes.”<note n="1135" id="iii.XXVI-p89.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p90"><scripRef passage="Luke xii. 47" id="iii.XXVI-p90.1" parsed="|Luke|12|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.47">Luke xii.
47</scripRef>.</p></note> So that more knowledge is a ground of more punishment. For this same
reason the priest, if he commit the same sin as those under government,
shall not have the same to endure, but things far more grievous.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p91">Perhaps, seeing the charge against him amplified, ye
tremble and fear, and marvel at me, as though I were going down a
precipice. But I am so confident on that righteous man’s behalf,
that I will proceed even farther; for the more I aggravate the charge,
so much the more shall I be able to show forth the praise of David.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p92">“And what more than this,” you will say,
“can be uttered?” Abundantly more. For as in the case of
Cain, what was done was not a murder only, but worse than even many
murders; for it was not a stranger, but a brother, whom he slew; and a
brother who had not done but suffered wrong; not after many murderers,
but having first originated the horrid crime: so here too that which
was perpetrated was not murder only. For it was no ordinary man that
did it, but a prophet: and he slays not him that had done wrong, but
him that had suffered wrong; for indeed he had been mortally wronged,
by the forcing away his wife: nevertheless after that he added this
also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p93">9. Perceive ye, how I have not spared that righteous
one? how without any the least reserve I have mentioned his offenses?
But yet, so confident am I concerning his defense, that after so great
load as this of his sin, I would there were present both the
Manichæans who most deride all this, and they that are diseased in
Marcion’s way,<note n="1136" id="iii.XXVI-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p94">Both these sects ascribed the Old Testament to an
evil principle, and argued against it from such cases as this of David.
Of Marcion, see St. Iren. i. 29, iv. 45. Of Manes, St. Aug. <i>contra
Faustum</i>. xxii. 5, 66. [<i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i>, first
series, vol. iv. p. 297.]</p></note>that I might fully stop their mouths. For they indeed say “he
committed murder and adultery;” but I say not this only, but have
also proved the murder to be twofold, first from him who suffered the
wrong, then from the quality of the person who offended. For it is not
the same thing, for one to whom the Spirit was vouchsafed, and on whom
so great benefits had been conferred, and who had been admitted to such
freedom of speech, and at such a time of life, to venture on crimes of
that sort; as without all these, to commit this self-same thing.
Nevertheless even in this respect is that illustrious man most of all
worthy of admiration, that when he had fallen into the very pit of
wickedness, he did not sink nor despair, nor cast himself down in
supineness, on receiving of the devil so fatal a wound; but quickly, or
rather straightway, and with great force, he gave a more fatal blow
than he had received.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p95">And the same thing occurred, as if in war and in battle
some barbarian had struck his spear into the heart of a chieftain, or
shot an arrow into his liver, and had added to the former wound a
second more fatal than it, and he that had received these grievous
blows, when fallen, and wallowing in much blood all about him, were
first to rise up quickly, then to hurl a spear at him that wounded him,
and exhibit him dead on the ground in a moment. Even so in this case
also, the greater thou declarest the wound, so much the more admirable
dost thou imply the soul of him that was wounded to be, that he

<pb n="179" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_179.html" id="iii.XXVI-Page_179" />

had power after this grievous wound both
to rise up again, and to stand in the very forefront of the battle
array, and bear down him that had wounded him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p96">And how great a thing this is, they best know, whosoever
are fallen into grievous sins. For it is not so much a proof of a
generous and vigorous soul to walk upright, and to run all the way (for
such a soul hath the good hope going along with it, to cheer and to
rouse it, to nerve and render it more zealous); as after those
innumerable crowns, and so many trophies, and victories, having
undergone the utmost loss, to be able to resume the same course. And
that what I say may be made plain, I will endeavor to bring before you
another example, not at all inferior to the former.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p97">For imagine, I pray thee, some pilot, when he had
compassed seas without number, and sailed over the whole ocean; after
those many storms, and rocks and waves, to sink, having with him a
great freight, in the very mouth of the harbor, and hardly with his
naked body to escape this grievous shipwreck; how would he naturally
feel towards the sea, and navigation, and such labors? Will such a one
then ever choose, unless he be of a very noble soul, to see a beach, or
a vessel, or a harbor? I trow not; but he will lie hiding his face,
seeing night all through the day, and shrinking from all things; and he
will choose rather to live by begging, than to put his hand to the same
labors.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p98">But not such was this blessed man; but though he had
undergone such a shipwreck, after those innumerable troubles and toils,
he stayed not with his face covered, but launched his vessel, and
having spread his sails, and taken the rudder in hand, he applies
himself to the same labors, and hath made his wealth more abundant
again. Now if to stand be so admirable, and not to lie down for ever
after one has fallen; to rise up again, and to do such deeds, what
crowns would not this deserve?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p99">And yet surely there were many things to drive him to
despair; as first, the greatness of his sins; secondly, that not at the
beginning of life, when our hopes also are more abundant, but near the
end, these things befell him. For neither doth the merchant, who hath
just gone out of the harbor and been wrecked, grieve equally with him,
who after very many traffickings strikes on a rock. Thirdly, that when
he had already obtained great wealth, he incurred this. Yea, for by
that time he had stored up no small merchandise: for instance, the
deeds of his early youth, when he was a shepherd; those about Goliath,
when he set up the glorious trophy; those pertaining to his
self-command respecting Saul. Since he showed forth even the
evangelical long-suffering, in that he got his enemy ten thousand times
into his hands, and continually spared him; and chose rather to be an
outcast from his country and from liberty, and from life itself, than
to slay him that was unjustly plotting against him. Likewise after his
coming to the kingdom, there were noble deeds of his to no small
amount.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p100">And besides what I have said, his credit also among the
many, and his fall from glory so bright, would cause no ordinary
perplexity. For the purple did by no means so much adorn him, as the
stain of his sin disgraced him. And ye know of course what a great
thing it is for evil deeds to be exposed, and how great a soul is
required in such an one, not to despond after the censure of the
multitude, and when he hath so many witnesses of his own offenses.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p101">Nevertheless all these darts that noble person drew out
of his soul, and so shone forth after this, so wiped out the stain,
became so pure, that his offspring even after his death had their sins
mitigated by him: and that which was said of Abraham, we find God
saying the same of this man also; or rather, much more of the latter.
For with respect to the patriarch it is said, “I remembered my
covenant with Abraham;”<note n="1137" id="iii.XXVI-p101.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p102"><scripRef passage="Exod. ii. 24" id="iii.XXVI-p102.1" parsed="|Exod|2|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.2.24">Exod. ii.

will defend this city for my servant David’s sake.”<note n="1138" id="iii.XXVI-p102.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p103"><scripRef passage="Isa. xxxvii. 35" id="iii.XXVI-p103.1" parsed="|Isa|37|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.37.35">Isa.
xxxvii. 35</scripRef>.</p></note> And besides, on account of His favor towards him, He suffered not
Solomon to fall from the kingdom, great as the sin was which he had
committed. And so great was the glory of the man, that Peter, so many
years after, in exhorting the Jews, spake on this wise: “Let me
freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and
buried.”<note n="1139" id="iii.XXVI-p103.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p104"><scripRef passage="Acts ii. 29" id="iii.XXVI-p104.1" parsed="|Acts|2|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.29">Acts ii.

to have had the Spirit vouchsafed to such a degree, that he was counted
worthy to prophesy again even concerning His Godhead; and thereby
stopping their mouths, He said, “How then doth David in spirit
call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right
hand ?”<note n="1140" id="iii.XXVI-p104.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p105"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 43; Ps. cx. 1" id="iii.XXVI-p105.1" parsed="|Matt|22|43|0|0;|Ps|10|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.43 Bible:Ps.10.1">Matt. xxii.
43; Ps. cx. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> And much as with Moses, so it fell out also with David. For as Miriam,
even against Moses’ will, was punished by God for insolence to
her brother,<note n="1141" id="iii.XXVI-p105.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVI-p106"><scripRef passage="Numb. xii. 13, 14" id="iii.XXVI-p106.1" parsed="|Num|12|13|12|14" osisRef="Bible:Num.12.13-Num.12.14">Numb. xii.
13, 14</scripRef>.</p></note>because He greatly loved the holy man; even so this man, injuriously
treated by his son,

<pb n="180" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_180.html" id="iii.XXVI-Page_180" />

God did
swiftly avenge, and that against his will.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p107">These things then are sufficient, yea rather before all
others these are sufficient to indicate the man’s excellency. For
when God pronounces His judgment, we ought to inquire no further. But
if ye would become particularly acquainted with His self command, ye
may by perusing his history after his sin, perceive his confidence
towards God, his benevolence, his growth in virtue, his strictness unto
his last breath.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p108">10. Having then these examples, let us be sober, and let
us strive not to despond, and if at any time we fall, not to lie
prostrate. For not to cast you into slothfulness, did I speak of the
sins of David, but to work in you more fear. For if that righteous man
through a little remissness received such wounds, what shall we have to
suffer, who are every day negligent? Do not therefore look at his fall,
and be remiss, but consider what great things he did even after this,
what great mournings, how much repentance he showed forth, adding his
nights to his days, pouring forth fountains of tears, washing his couch
with his tears, withal clothing himself in sackcloth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p109">Now if he needed so great a conversion, when will it be
possible for us to be saved, feeling insensible after so many sins? For
he that hath many good deeds, would easily even by this throw a shade
over his sins; but he that is unarmed, wherever he may receive a dart,
receives a mortal wound.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVI-p110">In order therefore that this may not be so, let us arm
ourselves with good works; and if any offense have befallen us, let us
wash it away: that we may be counted worthy, after having lived the
present life to the glory of God, to enjoy the life to come; unto which
may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

only the miracle, without signifying besides the time. And whereas the
others say, that she that lay ill did also entreat Him, this too he
hath passed over in silence. But this comes not of any dissonance, but
the one of brevity, the other of exact narrative. But for what intent
did He go into Peter’s house? As it seems to me, to take food.
This at least is declared when it is said,</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p8">“She arose and ministered unto Him.”<note n="1145" id="iii.XXVII-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p9"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 15" id="iii.XXVII-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|8|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.15">Matt. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p10">For He used to visit His disciples (as Matthew likewise,
when He had called him), so honoring them and making them more
zealous.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p11">But do thou mark, I pray thee, herein also Peter’s
reverence towards Him. For though he had his wife’s mother at
home lying ill, and very sick of a fever, he drew Him not into his
house, but waited first for the teaching to be finished, then for all
the others to be healed; and then when He had come in, besought Him.
Thus from the beginning was he instructed to prefer the things of all
others to his own.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p12">Therefore neither doth he himself bring Him in, but He
entered of His own accord (after the centurion had said, “I am
not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof”<note n="1146" id="iii.XXVII-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p13"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 8" id="iii.XXVII-p13.1" parsed="|Matt|8|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.8">Matt. viii.

of

<pb n="181" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_181.html" id="iii.XXVII-Page_181" />

what sort were the houses of
these fishermen; but for all that, He disdained not to enter into their
mean huts, teaching thee by all means to trample under foot human
pride.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p14">And sometimes He heals by words only, sometimes He even
stretches forth His hand, sometimes He doeth both these things, to
bring into sight His way of healing. For it was not His will always to
work miracles in the more surpassing manner: it being needful for Him
to be concealed awhile, and especially as concerned His disciples;
since they out of their great delight would have proclaimed everything.
And this was evident from the fact, that even after coming to the
mount, it was needful to charge them that they should tell no man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p15">Having therefore touched her body, He not only quenched
the fever, but also gave her back perfect health. Thus, the disease
being an ordinary one, He displayed His power by the manner of healing;
a thing which no physician’s art could have wrought. For ye know
that even after the departing of fevers, the patients yet need much
time to return to their former health. But then all took place at
once.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p16">And not in this case only, but also in that of the sea.
For neither there did He quiet the winds only and the storm, but He
also stayed at once the swelling of the waves; and this also was a
strange thing. For even if the tempest should cease, the waves continue
to swell for a long time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p17">But with Christ it was not so, but all at once was
ended: and so it befell this woman also. Wherefore also the evangelist,
to declare this, said, “She arose and ministered unto
Him;”<note n="1147" id="iii.XXVII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 15" id="iii.XXVII-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|8|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.15">Matt. viii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note>which was a sign both of Christ’s power, and of the disposition
of the woman, which she showed towards Christ.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p19">And another thing together with these we may hence
observe, that Christ grants the healing of some to the faith even of
others. Since in this case too, others besought Him, as also in the
instance of the centurion’s servant. And this grant He makes,
when there is no unbelief in him that is to be healed, but either
through disease he cannot come unto Him, or through ignorance imagines
nothing great of Him, or because of His immature age.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p20">2. “When the even was come, they brought unto Him
many that were possessed with devils: and He cast out the spirits from
them with a word, and healed all that were sick: that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet Esaias, that He took our
infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.”<note n="1148" id="iii.XXVII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 16, 17" id="iii.XXVII-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|8|16|8|17" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.16-Matt.8.17">Matt. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p22">Seest thou the multitude, by this time growing in faith?
For not even when the time pressed could they endure to depart, nor did
they account it unseasonable to bring their sick to Him at
eventide.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p23">But mark, I pray thee, how great a multitude of persons
healed the evangelists pass quickly over, not mentioning one by one,
and giving us an account of them, but in one word traversing an
unspeakable sea of miracles. Then lest the greatness of the wonder
should drive us again to unbelief, that even so great a people and
their various diseases should be delivered and healed by Him in one
moment of time, He brings in the prophet also to bear witness to what
is going on: indicating the abundance of the proof we have, in every
case, out of the Scriptures; such, that from the miracles themselves we
have no more; and He saith, that Esaias also spake of these things;
“He took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.”<note n="1149" id="iii.XXVII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p24"><scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 4" id="iii.XXVII-p24.1" parsed="|Isa|53|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.4">Isa. liii.

quote the Hebrew, not the <span class="c20" id="iii.XXVII-p24.2">LXX</span>. [The
explanation given in the Homily agrees with the <span class="c20" id="iii.XXVII-p24.3">LXX</span>., “he bare our sins and suffered pain (<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p24.4">ὀ<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p24.5">δυνται</span></span>) on our
behalf.” Hebrew has “sorrows” instead of
“sicknesses” or “diseases.”—R.]</p></note> He said not, “He did them away,” but “He took and
bare them;” which seems to me to be spoken rather of sins, by the
prophet, in harmony with John, where he saith, “Behold the Lamb
of God, that beareth the sin of the world.”<note n="1150" id="iii.XXVII-p24.6"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p25"><scripRef passage="John i. 29" id="iii.XXVII-p25.1" parsed="|John|1|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.29">John i.
29</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p26">How then doth the evangelist here apply it to diseases?
Either as rehearsing the passage in the historical sense,<note n="1151" id="iii.XXVII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p27"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p27.1">κατ
στοραν τν

ναγινσκων</span>,
“reading the text in that sense, to which the actual knowledge of
the facts concerning Christ, apart from what faith teaches, might guide
a man.” See Suicer in v. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p27.2">ἱστορα</span>.</p></note>or to show that most of our diseases arise from sins of the soul. For
if the sum of all, death itself, hath its root and foundation from sin,
much more the majority of our diseases also: since our very capability
of suffering did itself originate there.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p28">3. “Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him,
He gave commandment to depart unto the other side.”<note n="1152" id="iii.XXVII-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p29"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 18" id="iii.XXVII-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|8|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.18">Matt. viii.
18</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p30">Seest thou again His freedom from ostentation? in that
as the others say, “He charged the devils not to say it was
He,”<note n="1153" id="iii.XXVII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p31"><scripRef passage="Mark i. 34; Luke iv. 41" id="iii.XXVII-p31.1" parsed="|Mark|1|34|0|0;|Luke|4|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.1.34 Bible:Luke.4.41">Mark i. 34;
Luke iv. 41</scripRef>.</p></note>so this writer saith, He repels the multitudes from Him. Now in so
doing, He was at once both training us to be moderate,<note n="1154" id="iii.XXVII-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p32"><i>i.e</i>., “moderate, as receivers, in what
we expect from Him: and averse to all display, when we give in His
Name.”</p></note>and at the same time allaying the envy of the Jews, and teaching us to
do nothing for display. For He was not, we know, a healer to bodies
only,

<pb n="182" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_182.html" id="iii.XXVII-Page_182" />

but a curer also of the soul,
and a teacher of self-restraint; by both disclosing Himself, both by
putting away their diseases, and by doing nought for display. Because
they indeed were cleaving unto Him, loving Him, and marvelling at Him,
and desiring to look upon Him. For who would depart from one who was
doing such miracles? Who would not long, were it only to see the face,
and the mouth that was uttering such words?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p33">For not by any means in working wonders only was He
wonderful, but even when merely showing Himself, He was full of great
grace; and to declare this the prophet said, “Fair<note n="1155" id="iii.XXVII-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p34"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p34.1">ὡραο</span>.</p></note>in beauty beyond the children of men.”<note n="1156" id="iii.XXVII-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p35"><scripRef passage="Ps. xlv. 2" id="iii.XXVII-p35.1" parsed="|Ps|45|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.45.2">Ps. xlv.
2</scripRef>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XXVII-p35.2">LXX</span>.</p></note> And if Esaias saith, “He hath no form nor comeliness,”<note n="1157" id="iii.XXVII-p35.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p36"><scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 2" id="iii.XXVII-p36.1" parsed="|Isa|53|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.2">Isa. liii.
2</scripRef>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XXVII-p36.2">LXX</span>. [So the Hebrew.]</p></note>he affirms it either in comparison of the glory of His Godhead, which
surpasses all utterance and description; or as declaring what took
place at His passion, and the dishonor which He underwent at the season
of the cross, and the mean estate which throughout His life He
exemplified in all respects.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p37">Further: He did not first give “commandment to
depart unto the other side,” nor until He had healed them. For
surely they could not have borne it. As therefore on the mountain they
not only continued with Him while exhorting them, but also when it was
silence followed Him; so here too, not in His miracles only did they
wait on Him, but also when He had ceased again, from His very
countenance receiving no small benefit. For if Moses had his face made
glorious, and Stephen like that of an angel; consider thou our common
Lord, what manner of person it was likely He would appear at such a
time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p38">Many now perchance have fallen into a passionate desire
of seeing that form; but if we are willing we shall behold one far
better than that. For if we can pass through our present life with
Christian boldness,<note n="1158" id="iii.XXVII-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p39"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p39.1">μετ
παησα</span>.</p></note>we shall receive Him in the clouds, meeting Him in an immortal and
incorruptible body.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p40">But observe how He doth not simply drive them away, lest
He should hurt them. For He did not say, “withdraw,” but
“gave commandment to depart to the other side,” giving them
to expect that He would surely come thither.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p41">4. And the multitudes for their part evinced this great
love, and were following with much affection; but some one person, a
slave of wealth, and possessed with much arrogance, approaches Him, and
saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p42">“Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou
goest.”<note n="1159" id="iii.XXVII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 19" id="iii.XXVII-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|8|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.19">Matt. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p44">Seest thou how great his arrogance? For as not deigning
to be numbered with the multitude, and indicating that he is above the
common sort, so he comes near. Because such is the Jewish character;
full of unseasonable confidence. So too another afterwards, when all
men were keeping silence, of his own accord springs up, and saith,
“Which is the first commandment?”<note n="1160" id="iii.XXVII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 36; Luke x. 25" id="iii.XXVII-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|22|36|0|0;|Luke|10|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.36 Bible:Luke.10.25">Matt. xxii.
36; Luke x. 25</scripRef>. [The passage
in Luke tells of an entirely different incident. The citation from
Matthew is not exact, though “first” occurs in the answer
of our Lord.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p46">Yet nevertheless the Lord rebuked not his unseasonable
confidence, teaching us to bear even with such as these. Therefore He
doth not openly convict them who are devising mischief, but replies to
their secret thought, leaving it to themselves only to know that they
are convicted, and doubly doing them good, first by showing that He
knows what is in their conscience, next by granting unto them
concealment after this manifestation, and allowing them to recover
themselves again, if they will: which thing He doth in the case of this
man also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p47">For he, seeing the many signs, and many drawn after Him,
thought to make a gain out of such miracles; wherefore also he was
forward to follow Him. And whence is this manifest? From the answer
which Christ makes, meeting not the question, as it stands verbally,
but the temper shown in its meaning. For, “What?” saith He,
“dost thou look to gather wealth by following me? Seest thou not
then that I have not even a lodging, not even so much as the birds
have?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p48">For “the foxes,” saith He, “have
holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not
where to lay His head.”<note n="1161" id="iii.XXVII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p49"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 20" id="iii.XXVII-p49.1" parsed="|Matt|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.20">Matt. viii.
20</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p50">Now these were not the words of one turning Himself
away, but of one who while putting to the proof his evil disposition,
yet permitted him (if he were willing with such a prospect) to follow
Him. And to convince thee of his wickedness, when he had heard these
things, and had been proved, he did not say, “I am ready to
follow Thee.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p51">5. And in many other places also Christ is clearly doing
this; He doth not openly convict, but by His answer He manifests the
purpose of them that are coming unto Him. Thus to him again that said,
“Good Master,” and had thought by such flattery to gain His
favor, according to his purpose He made answer, saying, “Why
callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is,
God.”<note n="1162" id="iii.XXVII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p52"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 16, 17; Luke xviii. 18, 19" id="iii.XXVII-p52.1" parsed="|Matt|19|16|19|17;|Luke|18|18|18|19" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.16-Matt.19.17 Bible:Luke.18.18-Luke.18.19">Matt. xix.

time” (so He speaks) “is always ready, but my time is not
yet come.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p57">And in the opposite cases too He doth so; as in that of
Nathanael, saying, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
guile.”<note n="1165" id="iii.XXVII-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p58"><scripRef passage="John i. 47" id="iii.XXVII-p58.1" parsed="|John|1|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.47">John i.

him that sent them. And with the people again in like manner, He
addresses His discourse unto their conscience, saying, “What went
ye out into the wilderness to see?”<note n="1167" id="iii.XXVII-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p60"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 7" id="iii.XXVII-p60.1" parsed="|Matt|11|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.7">Matt. xi.

been a sort of easy and wavering person; to correct this their
suspicion, He saith, “What went ye out into the wilderness to
see? A reed shaken with the wind?” or, “a man clothed with
soft raiment?” by both these figures declaring, that he was
neither of himself a waverer, nor would be softened by any luxury. Thus
then in the present case also He makes His answer to their meaning.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p61">And see how in this also He shows forth great
moderation: in that He said not, “I have it indeed, but despise
it,” but “I have it not.” Seest thou what exact care
goes along with His condescension? Even as when He eats and drinks,
when He seems to be acting in an opposite way to John, this too He
doeth for the sake of the Jews’ salvation, or rather for that of
the whole world, at once both stopping the mouths of the heretics,<note n="1168" id="iii.XXVII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p62"><i>i. e</i>., of those heretics who “commanded
to abstain from meats,” as though possessed with some evil

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p63">6. But a certain other one, we read, said unto Him,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p64">“Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my
father.”<note n="1169" id="iii.XXVII-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p65"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 21" id="iii.XXVII-p65.1" parsed="|Matt|8|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.21">Matt. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p66">Didst thou mark the difference? how one impudently
saith, “I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest;” but
this other, although asking a thing of sacred duty,<note n="1170" id="iii.XXVII-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p67"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p67.1">ὅσιον</span>.</p></note>saith, “Suffer me.” Yet He suffered him not, but saith,
“Let the dead bury their dead, but do thou follow me.” For
in every case He had regard to the intention. And wherefore did He not
suffer him? one may ask. Because, on the one hand, there were those
that would fulfill that duty, and the dead was not going to remain
unburied; on the other, it was not fit for this man to be taken away
from the weightier matters. But by saying, “their own
dead,” He implies that this is not one of His dead. And that
because he that was dead, was, at least as I suppose, of the
unbelievers.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p68">Now if thou admire the young man, that for a matter so
necessary he besought Jesus, and did not go away of his own accord;
much rather do thou admire him for staying also when forbidden.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p69">Was it not then, one may say, extreme ingratitude, not
to be present at the burial of his father? If indeed he did so out of
negligence, it was ingratitude, but if in order not to interrupt a more
needful work, his departing would most surely have been of extreme
inconsideration. For Jesus forbad him, not as commanding to think
lightly of the honor due to our parents, but signifying that nothing
ought to be to us more urgent than the things of Heaven, and that we
ought with all diligence to cleave to these, and not to put them off
for ever so little, though our engagements be exceeding indispensable
and pressing. For what can be more needful than to bury a father? what
more easy? since it would not even consume any long time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p70">But if one ought not to spend even as much time as is
required for a father’s burial, nor is it safe to be parted even
so long from our spiritual concerns; consider what we deserve, who all
our time stand off from the things that pertain to Christ, and prefer
things very ordinary to such as are needful, and are remiss, when there
is nothing to press on us?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p71">And herein too we should admire the instructiveness<note n="1171" id="iii.XXVII-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p72"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p72.1">φιλοσοφαν</span>
.</p></note>of His teaching, that He nailed him fast to His word, and with this
freed him from those endless evils, such as lamentations, and
mournings, and the things that follow thereafter. For after the burial
he must of necessity proceed to inquire about the will, then about the
distribution of the inheritance, and all the other things that follow
thereupon; and thus waves after waves coming in succession upon him,
would bear him away very far from the harbor of truth. For this cause
He draws him, and fastens him to Himself.</p>

<pb n="184" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_184.html" id="iii.XXVII-Page_184" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p73">But if thou still marvellest, and art perplexed, that he
was not permitted to be present at his father’s burial; consider
that many suffer not the sick, if it be a father that is dead, or a
mother, or a child, or any other of their kinsmen, to know it, nor to
follow him to the tomb; and we do not for this charge them with cruelty
nor inhumanity: and very reasonably. For, on the contrary, it were
cruelty to bring out to the funeral solemnity men in such a state.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p74">But if to mourn and be afflicted in mind for them that
are of our kindred is evil, much more our being withdrawn from
spiritual discourses. For this same cause He said elsewhere also,
“No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is
fit for the kingdom of Heaven.”<note n="1172" id="iii.XXVII-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p75"><scripRef passage="Luke ix. 62" id="iii.XXVII-p75.1" parsed="|Luke|9|62|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.9.62">Luke ix.

must not wantonly lose any, no not the smallest time, though there be
ten thousand things to press on us; but to set what is spiritual before
all, even the most indispensable matters, and to know both what is
life, and what is death. Since many even of them that seem to live are
nothing better than dead men, living as they do in wickedness; or
rather these are worse than the dead; “For he that is
dead,” it is said, “is freed from sin,”<note n="1173" id="iii.XXVII-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p77"><scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 7" id="iii.XXVII-p77.1" parsed="|Rom|6|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.7">Rom. vi.

eaten of worms, nor lies in a coffin, nor hath closed his eyes, nor is
bound in graveclothes. Nay, for these things he undergoes more
grievously than the dead, no worms devouring him, but the passions of
his soul tearing him to pieces more fiercely than wild beasts.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p78">And if his eyes be open, this too again is far worse
than having closed them. For those of the dead see no evil thing, but
this man is gathering unto himself diseases without number, while his
eyes are open. And whereas the other lies in a coffin, unmoved by
anything, this one is buried in the tomb of his innumerable
distempers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p79">But thou seest not his body in a state of decay. And
what of that? Since before his body, his soul is corrupted and
destroyed, and undergoes greater rottenness. For the other stinketh a
few<note n="1174" id="iii.XXVII-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p80">[More exactly, “ten days.”—R.]</p></note>days, but this for the whole of his life exhales evil odors, having a
mouth more foul than sewers.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p81">And so the one differs from the other, by just so much
as this, that the dead indeed undergoes that decay only which comes of
nature, but this man together with that, brings in also that rottenness
which is from intemperance, devising each day unnumbered causes of
corruption.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p82">But is he borne on horseback? And what of that? Why, so
is the other on a couch. And what is very hard, while the other is seen
by no one in his dissolution and decay, but hath his coffin for a veil,
this man is going about everywhere with his evil savor, bearing about a
dead soul in his body as in a tomb.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p83">And if one could but once see a man’s soul who is
living in luxury and vice, thou wouldest perceive that it is far better
to lie bound in a grave than to be rivetted by the chains of our sins;
and to have a stone laid over thee, than that heavy cover<note n="1175" id="iii.XXVII-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p84"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p84.1">πμα</span>, the lid

these dead men, seeing that they are past feeling, to come near to
Jesus in their behalf, as Mary then did in the case of Lazarus. Though
he “stinketh,” though he be “dead four days,”
do not despair, but approach, and remove the stone first. Yea, for then
thou shalt see him lying as in a tomb, and bound in his grave
clothes.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p85">And if ye will, let it be some one of them that are
great and distinguished, whom we bring before you. Nay, fear not, for I
will state the example without a name: or rather, though I should
mention the name, not even so need there be any fear: for who ever
fears a dead man? seeing that whatever one may do, he continues dead,
and the dead cannot injure the living either little or much.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p86">Let us then behold their head bound up. For indeed, when
they are for ever drunken, even as the dead by their many wrappers and
grave-clothes, so are all their organs of sense closed and bound up.
And if thou wilt look at their hands too, thou shalt see these again
bound to their belly, like those of the dead, and fastened about not
with grave-clothes, but what is far more grievous, with the bands of
covetousness: obtaining as they do no leave from her to be stretched
out for alms-giving, or for any other of such like good deeds; rather
she renders them more useless than those of the dead. Wouldest thou
also see their feet bound together? See them again fastened about with
cares, and for this cause never able to run unto the house of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p87">Hast thou seen the dead? behold also the embalmer. Who
then is the embalmer of these? The devil, who carefully fastens them
about, and suffers not the man any longer to appear a man, but a dry
stock. For where there is no eye, nor hands, nor feet, nor any other
such thing, how can such an one appear a man? Even so may we see their
soul also swaddled up, and rather an image<note n="1176" id="iii.XXVII-p87.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p88"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVII-p88.1">εδωλον</span>. The classical use of

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p89">Forasmuch then as they are in a sort of senseless state,
being turned to dead men, let us in their behalf draw nigh unto Jesus,
let us entreat Him to raise them up, let us take away the stone, let us
loosen the grave clothes. For if thou take away the stone, that is,
their insensibility to their own miseries, thou wilt quickly be able to
bring them also out of the tomb; and having brought them out, thou wilt
more easily rid them of their bonds. Then shall Christ know thee, when
thou art risen, when unbound; then will He call thee even unto His own
supper.<note n="1177" id="iii.XXVII-p89.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVII-p90">Alluding to <scripRef passage="John xii. 2" id="iii.XXVII-p90.1" parsed="|John|12|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.12.2">John xii. 2</scripRef>.</p></note> As many therefore of you as are friends of Christ, as many as are
disciples, as many as love him that is gone, draw near unto Jesus, and
pray. For even though his ill savor abound and be ever so intense,
nevertheless not even so should we, his friends, forsake him, but so
much the rather draw near; even as the sisters of Lazarus then did;
neither should we leave interceding, beseeching, entreating, until we
have received him alive.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVII-p91">For if we thus order our own affairs, and those of our

specific as to time. This event is placed very much out of

not discuss such questions with any fullness. Indeed, the order of
Matthew seems to have been accepted up to his time. The earliest
harmonies were based upon Matthew. Comp. even Augustin, <i>Harmony,
Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i>, vol. vi., first series, pp.
67–69, and elsewhere.—R.]</p></note> But this evangelist not so, but he maintains the order in this place
also. For they did not all of them write all things in this way. And
these things I have mentioned before, lest any one from the omission
should suppose there was a discordance.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p7">The multitudes then He sent on, but the disciples He
took with Himself: for the others mention this too. And He took them
with Him, not for nought, nor at hazard, but in order to make them
spectators of the miracle that was to take place. For like a most
excellent trainer, He was anointing them with a view to both objects;
as well to be undismayed in dangers, as to be modest in honors. Thus,
that they might not be high minded, because having sent away the rest,
He retained them, He suffers them to be tossed with the tempest; at
once correcting this, and disciplining them to bear trials nobly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p8">For great indeed were the former miracles too, but this
contained also in it a kind of discipline, and that no inconsiderable
one, and was a sign akin to that of old.<note n="1180" id="iii.XXVIII-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p9"><i>i.e</i>., the miracle at the Red Sea, afterwards
mentioned.</p></note> For this cause He takes the disciples only with Himself. For as, when
there was a display of miracles, He suffers the people also to be
present; so when trial and terrors were rising up against Him, then He
takes with Him none but the champions of the whole world, whom He was
to discipline.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p13">The tempest therefore being thoroughly excited, and the

perish.”<note n="1183" id="iii.XXVIII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 25" id="iii.XXVIII-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|8|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.25">Matt. viii.

discipline these things were permitted, and they were a type of the
temptations that were to overtake them. Yea, for after these things
again, He often suffered them to fall into more grievous tempests of
fortune,<note n="1184" id="iii.XXVIII-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p15"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVIII-p15.1">πραγμτων</span>, “of

brethren, have you ignorant, that we were pressed out of measure beyond

deaths.” Signifying therefore hereby, that they ought to be
confident, though the waves rise high, and that He orders all things
for good, He first of all reproves them. For indeed their very alarm
was a profitable occurrence, that the miracle might appear greater, and
their remembrance of the event be rendered lasting. Since when anything
strange is about to happen, there are prepared beforehand many things
to cause remembrance, lest after the miracle hath passed by, men should
sink into forgetfulness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p17">Thus Moses also first is in fear of the serpent, and not
merely in fear, but even with much distress: and then he sees that
strange thing come to pass.<note n="1186" id="iii.XXVIII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p18"><scripRef passage="Exod. iv. 3, 4" id="iii.XXVIII-p18.1" parsed="|Exod|4|3|4|4" osisRef="Bible:Exod.4.3-Exod.4.4">Exod. iv.
3, 4</scripRef>.</p></note> So these too, having first looked to perish, were then saved, that
having confessed the danger, they might learn the greatness of the
miracle.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p19">Therefore also He sleeps: for had He been awake when it
happened, either they would not have feared, or they would not have
besought Him, or they would not so much as have thought of His being
able to do any such thing. Therefore He sleeps, to give occasion for
their timidity, and to make their perception of what was happening more
distinct. For a man looks not with the same eyes on what happens in the
persons of others, as in his own. Therefore since they had seen all
benefitted, while themselves had enjoyed no benefit, and were supine
(for neither were they lame, nor had they any other such infirmity);
and it was meet they should enjoy His benefits by their own perception:
He permits the storm, that by their deliverance they might attain to a
clearer perception of the benefit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p20">Therefore neither doth He this in the presence of the
multitudes, that they might not be condemned for little faith, but He
has them apart, and corrects them, and before the tempest of the waters
He puts an end to the tempests of their soul, rebuking them, and
saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p21">“Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith:”
instructing them also, that men’s fear is wrought not by the
approach of the temptations, but by the weakness of their mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p22">But should any one say, that it was not fearfulness, or
little faith, to come near and awaken Him; I would say this, that that
very thing was an especial sign of their wanting the right opinion
concerning Him. That is, His power to rebuke when awakened they knew,
but that He could do so even sleeping, they knew not as yet.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p23">And why at all marvel that it was so now, when even
after many other miracles their impressions were still rather
imperfect? wherefore also they are often rebuked; as when He saith,

this account they were cast into perplexity, saying, “What manner
of man is this?” since while the sleep and the outward appearance
showed man, the sea and the calm declared Him God.</p>

need any prayer, but, as was meet for a master commanding His handmaid,

ceased.”<note n="1190" id="iii.XXVIII-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p30"><scripRef passage="Ps. cvii. 25" id="iii.XXVIII-p30.1" parsed="|Ps|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.7.25">Ps. cvii.
25</scripRef>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XXVIII-p30.2">LXX</span>.</p></note> So here likewise, He spake, and “there was a great calm.”
And for this most of all did the multitudes marvel at him; who would
not have marvelled, had He done it in such manner as did Moses.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p31">2. Now when He is departed from the sea, there follows
another miracle yet more awful. For men possessed with devils,<note n="1191" id="iii.XXVIII-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p32">[R.V., “demons,” and so the translator
in many places in this Homily.—R.]</p></note>like wicked runaways at sight of their master, said,</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p33">“What have we to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of
God? Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time?”<note n="1192" id="iii.XXVIII-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 29" id="iii.XXVIII-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|8|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.29">Matt. viii.
29</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p35">For, because the multitudes called Him man, the devils
came proclaiming His Godhead, and they that heard not the sea swelling
and subsiding, heard from the devils the same cry, as it by its calm
was loudly uttering.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p36">Then, lest the thing might seem to come of flattery,
according to their actual experience they cry out and say, “Art
Thou come hither to torment us before the time?” With this view,
then, their enmity is avowed beforehand, that their entreaty may not
incur suspicion. For indeed they were invisibly receiving stripes, and
the sea was not in such a storm as they; galled, and inflamed, and
suffering things intolerable from His mere presence. Accordingly, no
man daring to bring them to Him, Christ of Himself goes unto them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p37">And Matthew indeed relates that they said, “Art
Thou come hither before the time to torment us?” but the other
evangelists have added, that they also entreated and adjured Him not to
cast them into the deep.<note n="1193" id="iii.XXVIII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p38"><scripRef passage="Mark v. 10; Luke viii. 31" id="iii.XXVIII-p38.1" parsed="|Mark|5|10|0|0;|Luke|8|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.5.10 Bible:Luke.8.31">Mark v. 10;
Luke viii. 31</scripRef>.</p></note> For they supposed that their punishment was now close upon them, and
feared, as even now about to fall into vengeance.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p39">And though Luke and those who follow him<note n="1194" id="iii.XXVIII-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p40"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVIII-p40.1">ο περ
τν Λουκν</span>.</p></note>say that it was one person, but this evangelist two, this doth not
exhibit any discrepancy at all. I grant if they had said, there was
only one, and no other, they would appear to disagree with Matthew; but
if that spake of the one, this of the two, the statement comes not of
disagreement, but of a different manner of narration. That is, I for my
part think, Luke singled out the fiercest one of them for his
narrative, wherefore also in more tragical wise doth he report their
miserable case; as, for instance, that bursting his bonds and chains he
used to wander about the wilderness. And Mark saith, that he also cut
himself with the stones.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p41">And their words too are such as well betray their
implacable and shameless nature. For, saith he, “Art thou come
hither to torment us before the time?” You see, that they had
sinned, they could not deny, but they demand not to suffer their
punishment before the time. For, since He had caught them in the act of
perpetrating those horrors so incurable and lawless, and deforming and
punishing<note n="1195" id="iii.XXVIII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p42"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVIII-p42.1">τιμωρουμνου</span>
.</p></note> His creature in every way; and they supposed that He, for the excess of
their crimes, would not await the time of their punishment: therefore
they besought and entreated Him: and they that endured not even bands
of iron come bound, and they that run about the mountains, are gone
forth into the plain; and those who hinder all others from passing, at
sight of Him blocking up the way, stand still.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p43">3. But what can be the reason that they love also to
dwell in the tombs? They would fain suggest to the multitude a
pernicious opinion, as though the souls of the dead become demons,<note n="1196" id="iii.XXVIII-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p44">So St. Augustin <i>de Civitate De</i>i, ix. 11.
“Plotinus says that the souls of men are demons, and of men
become Lares, if they are of good desert; if of bad, Lemures or
Larvæ.” Mr. Field refers to St. Chrys. 2 <i>Hom. on
Lazarus</i>, vi. 235, 6 (Savile). “Many of the simpler sort
imagine that the souls of such as die violent deaths are turned into
demons, whereas the souls which really become such are theirs who are
yet living in their sins, not by change of substance, but by imitating
their evil mind.…Why did the devil introduce this wicked
doctrine? He tried to undermine the glory of the martyrs. I mean,
because they die violent deaths, he wishing to diffuse an evil
impression of them, did this. This, however, he could not do, but
another very grievous result he did accomplish. He induced, by these
doctrines, the sorcerers that minister to him to butcher the bodies of
many tender youths, in the hope that they would become demons, and in
return minister to them.” He proceeds to argue against the
superstition much as in the text here.</p></note>which God forbid we should ever admit into our conception. “But
what then wilt thou say,” one may ask, “when many of the
sorcerers take children and slay them, in order to have the soul
afterwards to assist them?” Why, whence is this evident? for of
their slaying them, indeed, many tell us, but as to the souls of the
slain being with them, whence knowest thou it, I pray thee? “The
possessed themselves,” it is replied, “cry out, I am the
soul of such a one.” But this too is a kind of stage-play, and
devilish deceit. For it is not the spirit of the dead that cries out,
but the evil spirit that feigns these things in order to deceive the
hearers. For if it were possible for a soul to enter into the substance
of an evil spirit, much more into its own body.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p45">And besides, it stands not to reason that

<pb n="188" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_188.html" id="iii.XXVIII-Page_188" />

the injured soul should co-operate with the
wrong-doer, or that a man should be able to change an incorporeal power
into another substance. For if in bodies this were impossible, and one
could not make a man’s body become that of an ass; much more were
this impossible in the invisible soul; neither could one transform it
into the substance of an evil spirit. So that these are the sayings of
besotted old wives, and spectres to frighten children.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p46">Nor indeed is it possible for a soul, torn away from the
body, to wander here any more. For “the souls of the righteous
are in the hand of God;”<note n="1197" id="iii.XXVIII-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p47"><scripRef passage="Wisd. iii. 1" id="iii.XXVIII-p47.1" parsed="|Wis|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Wis.3.1">Wisd. iii.
1</scripRef>.</p></note>and if of the righteous, then those children’s souls also; for
neither are they wicked: and the souls too of sinners are straightway
led away hence. And it is evident from Lazarus and the rich man; and
elsewhere too Christ saith, “This day they require thy soul of
thee.”<note n="1198" id="iii.XXVIII-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p48"><scripRef passage="Luke xii. 20" id="iii.XXVIII-p48.1" parsed="|Luke|12|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.20">Luke xii.
20</scripRef>.</p></note> And it may not be that a soul, when it is gone forth from the body,
should wander here; nor is the reason hard to see. For if we, going
about on the earth which is familiar and well known to us, being
encompassed with a body, when we are journeying in a strange road, know
not which way to go unless we have some one to lead us; how should the
soul, being rent away from the body, and having gone out from all her
accustomed region, know where to walk without one to show her the
way?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p49">And from many other things too one might perceive, that
it is not possible for a disembodied soul to remain here. For both
Stephen saith, “Receive my spirit;”<note n="1199" id="iii.XXVIII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p50"><scripRef passage="Acts vii. 59" id="iii.XXVIII-p50.1" parsed="|Acts|7|59|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.7.59">Acts vii.
59</scripRef>.</p></note>and Paul, “To depart and to be with Christ is far better;”<note n="1200" id="iii.XXVIII-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p51"><scripRef passage="Phil. i. 23" id="iii.XXVIII-p51.1" parsed="|Phil|1|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.23">Phil. i.
23</scripRef>.</p></note>and of the patriarch too the Scripture saith, that “he was
gathered unto his fathers, being cherished in a good old age.”<note n="1201" id="iii.XXVIII-p51.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p52"><scripRef passage="Gen. xv. 15" id="iii.XXVIII-p52.1" parsed="|Gen|15|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.15.15">Gen. xv.
15</scripRef>, in <span class="c20" id="iii.XXVIII-p52.2">LXX</span>.</p></note> And as to the proof, that neither can the souls of sinners continue
here; hear the rich man making much entreaty for this, and not
obtaining it; since had it been at all possible, he would have come,
and have told what had come to pass there.<note n="1202" id="iii.XXVIII-p52.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p53"><scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 27, 28" id="iii.XXVIII-p53.1" parsed="|Luke|16|27|16|28" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.27-Luke.16.28">Luke xvi.
27, 28</scripRef>.</p></note> Whence it is evident that after their departure hence our souls are led
away into some place, having no more power of themselves to come back
again, but awaiting that dreadful day.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p54">4. Now, should any one say, “And wherefore did
Christ fulfill the devils’ request, suffering them to depart into
the herd of swine?” this would be our reply, that He did so, not
as yielding to them, but as providing for many objects thereby. One, to
teach them that are delivered from those wicked tyrants, how great the
malice of their insidious enemies: another, that all might learn, how
not even against swine are they bold, except He allow them; a third,
that they would have treated those men more grievously than the swine,
unless even in their calamity they had enjoyed much of God’s
providential care. For that they hate us more than the brutes is surely
evident to every man. So then they that spared not the swine, but in
one moment of time cast them all down the precipice, much more would
they have done so to the men whom they possessed, leading them towards
the desert, and carrying them away, unless even in their very tyranny
the guardian care of God had abounded, to curb and check the excess of
their violence. Whence it is manifest that there is no one, who doth
not enjoy the benefit of God’s providence. And if not all alike,
nor after one manner, this is itself a very great instance of
providence; in that according to each man’s profit, the work also
of providence is displayed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p55">And besides what hath been mentioned, there is another
thing also, which we learn from this; that His providence is not only
over all in common, but also over each in particular; which He also
declared with respect to His disciples, saying, “But the very
hairs of your head are numbered.”<note n="1203" id="iii.XXVIII-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p56"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 30" id="iii.XXVIII-p56.1" parsed="|Matt|10|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.30">Matt. x.
30</scripRef>.</p></note> And from these demoniacs too, one may clearly perceive this; who would
have “been choked” long before, if they had not enjoyed the
benefit of much tender care from above.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p57">For these reasons then He suffered them to depart into
the herd of swine, and that they also who dwelt in those places should
learn His power. For where His name was great, He did not greatly
display Himself: but where no one knew Him, but they were still in an
insensible condition, He made His miracles to shine out, so as to bring
them over to the knowledge of His Godhead. For it is evident from the
event that the inhabitants of that city were a sort of senseless
people; for when they ought to have adored and marvelled at His power,
they sent Him away, and “besought Him that He would depart out of
their coasts.”<note n="1204" id="iii.XXVIII-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p58"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 34" id="iii.XXVIII-p58.1" parsed="|Matt|8|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.34">Matt. viii.
34</scripRef>. [R.V., “from their
borders.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p59">But for what intent did the devils destroy the swine?
Everywhere they have labored to drive men to dismay, and everywhere
they rejoice in destruction. This, for instance, the devil did with
respect to Job, although in that case too God suffered it, but neither
in that case as complying with the devil, but willing to show His own
servant the more

<pb n="189" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_189.html" id="iii.XXVIII-Page_189" />

glorious, cutting
off from the evil spirit all pretext for his shamelessness, and turning
on his own head what was done against the righteous man. Because now
also the contrary of what they wished came to pass. For the power of
Christ was gloriously proclaimed, and the wickedness of the demons,
from which He delivered those possessed by them, was more plainly
indicated; and how they want power to touch even swine, without
permission from the God of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p60">And if any would take these things in a hidden
sense,<note n="1205" id="iii.XXVIII-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p61"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVIII-p61.1">κατ

“analogical” sense of Scripture in the later Hermeneuties.

the usage of ecclesiastical Greek.—R.]</p></note>there is nothing to hinder. For the history indeed is this, but we are
to know assuredly, that the swinish sort of men are especially liable
to the operations of the demons. And as long as they are men that
suffer such things, they are often able yet to prevail; but if they are
become altogether swine, they are not only possessed, but are also cast
down the precipice. And besides, lest any should suppose what was done
to be mere acting, instead of distinctly believing that the devils<note n="1206" id="iii.XXVIII-p61.5"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p62">[“demons.”]</p></note>were gone out; by the death of the swine this is rendered manifest.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p63">And mark also His meekness together with His power. For
when the inhabitants of that country, after having received such
benefits, were driving Him away, He resisted not, but retired, and left
those who had shown themselves unworthy of His teaching, having given
them for teachers them that had been freed from the demons, and the
swine-herds, that they might of them learn all that had happened;
whilst Himself retiring leaves the fear vigorous in them. For the
greatness withal of the loss was spreading the fame of what had been
done, and the event penetrated their mind. And from many quarters were
wafted sounds, proclaiming the strangeness of the miracle; from the
cured, and from the drowned, from the owners of the swine, from the men
that were feeding them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p64">5. These things any one may see happening now also, even
many in the tombs possessed of evil spirits, whom nothing restrains
from their madness; not iron, nor chain, nor multitude of men, nor
advice, nor admonition, nor terror, nor threat, nor any other such
thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p65">For so when any man is dissolute, eager after all
embraces,<note n="1207" id="iii.XXVIII-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p66"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVIII-p66.1">σωματ</span>.</p></note>he differs not at all from the demoniac, but goes about naked like him,
clad indeed in garments, but deprived of the true covering, and
stripped of his proper glory; cutting himself not with stones, but with
sins more hurtful than many stones. Who then shall be able to bind such
a one? Who, to stay his unseemliness and frenzy, his way of never
coming to himself, but forever haunting the tombs? For such are the
resorts of the harlots, full of much evil savor, of much
rottenness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p67">And what of the covetous man? Is he not like this? For
who will be able ever to bind him? Are there not fears and daily
threats, and admonitions, and counsels? Nay, all these bonds he bursts
asunder; and if any one come to set him free, he adjures him that he
may not be freed, accounting it the greatest torture not to be in
torture: than which what can be more wretched? For as to that evil
spirit, even though he despised men, yet he yielded to the command of
Christ, and quickly sprang out of the man’s body; but this man
yields not even to His commandment. See at least how he daily hears Him
saying, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon,”<note n="1208" id="iii.XXVIII-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p68"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 24" id="iii.XXVIII-p68.1" parsed="|Matt|6|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.24">Matt. vi.
24</scripRef>.</p></note>and threatening hell, and the incurable torments, and obeys not: not
that He is stronger than Christ, but because against our will Christ
corrects us not.<note n="1209" id="iii.XXVIII-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p69">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVIII-p69.1">ου
σωψρονζει</span>.]</p></note> Therefore such men live as in desert places, though they be in the
midst of cities. For who, that hath reason, would choose to be with
such men? I for my part would sooner consent to dwell with ten thousand
demoniacs, than with one diseased in this way.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p70">And that I am not mistaken in saying this, is manifest
from their respective feelings. For these last account him an enemy
that hath done them no wrong, and desire even to take him for a slave
when he is free, and encompass him with ten thousand evils; but the
demoniacs do no such thing, but toss their disease to and for within
themselves. And while these overturn many houses, and cause the name of
God to be blasphemed, and are a pest to the city and to the whole
earth; they that are troubled by evil spirits, deserve rather our pity
and our tears. And the one for the more part act in insensibility, but
the others are frantic while they reason, keeping their orgies in the
midst of cities, and maddened with some new kind of madness. For what
do all the demoniacs so bad, as what Judas dared to do, when he showed
forth that extremity of wickedness? And all too that imitate him, like
fierce wild beasts escaped from their cage, trouble their cities, no
man restraining them. For these also have bonds upon them on every
side; such as the fears of the judges, the threatening of the laws, the
condemnation of the multitude,

<pb n="190" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_190.html" id="iii.XXVIII-Page_190" />

and
other things more than these; yet bursting asunder even these, they
turn all things upside down. And should any one remove these altogether
from them, then would he know assuredly the demon that is in them to be
far fiercer, and more frantic than he who is just now gone forth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p71">But since this may not be, let us for the time suppose
it for argument’s sake: and let us take off from him all his
chains, and then shall we clearly know his manifest madness. But be not
afraid of the monster, when we uncover it; for it is the representation
in word, not the thing in truth. Let there be then some man, darting
fire from his eyes, black, having from either shoulder serpents hanging
down instead of hands; and let him have also a mouth, with sharp swords
set in it instead of teeth, and for a tongue a gushing fountain of
poison and some baneful drug; and a belly more consuming than any
furnace, devouring all that is cast unto it, and a sort of winged feet
more vehement than any flame; and let his face be made up of a dog and
of a wolf; and let him utter nothing human, but something discordant,
and unpleasing, and terrible; and let him have also in his hands a
firebrand. Perhaps what we have said seems to you to be terrible, but
we have not even yet fashioned him worthily; for together with these
things we must add others besides. I mean, that he is also to slay them
that meet with him, to devour them, to fasten upon their flesh.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p72">Yet is the covetous man much more fierce even than this,
assailing all like hell, swallowing all up, going about a common enemy
to the race of men. Why, he would have no man exist, that he may
possess all things. And he stops not even at this, but when in his
longing he shall have destroyed all men, he longs also to mar the
substance of the earth, and to see it all become gold; nay, not the
earth only, but hills also, and woods, and fountains, and in a word all
things that appear.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p73">And to convince you that not even yet have we set forth
his madness, let there be no man to accuse and frighten him, but take
away the terror of the laws in supposition awhile, and thou wilt see
him snatching up a sword, laying violent hands on all, and sparing
none; neither friend, nor kinsman, nor brother, nor even his very
parent. Nay rather, in this case there is not even need of supposing,
but let us ask him, if he is not for ever framing to himself such
imaginations, and if he does not in thought range among all men to
destroy them; both friends and kinsmen, and even his very parents. Nay
rather there is no need even to ask, because in truth all men know that
they who are under the power of this disease are wearied even of their
father’s old age; and that which is sweet, and universally
desirable, the having children, they esteem grievous and unwelcome:
many at least with this view have even paid money to be childless, and
have maimed their nature, not only by slaying their children after
birth, but by not suffering them even to be born at all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p74">6. Marvel not, therefore, if we have thus sketched the
covetous man (for in truth he is far worse than what we have said); but
let us consider how we shall deliver him from the demon. How then shall
we deliver him? If he may be clearly made aware, that his love of money
stands very much in his way in respect of this very object, the gaining
of money; for they that wish to gain in little things undergo great
losses; whence accordingly a proverb hath been put forth to this same
effect.<note n="1210" id="iii.XXVIII-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXVIII-p75">Perhaps the <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXVIII-p75.1">χπυςσεα
χαλει`ων</span>, of which
Erasmus says, <i>“Conveniet uti, quoties officium aut munus longe
impari munere pensatur Admissus est in *principis, sed excitit ex
amicitia Christi.”</i> Adag. 1, Cent. ii. <scripRef passage="Prov. 1" id="iii.XXVIII-p75.2" parsed="|Prov|1|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.1">Prov. 1</scripRef>.</p></note> Many, for instance, on many occasions, wishing to lend at large usury,
and through the expectation of gain not having inquired about them who
receive their money, have together with the interest lost also all
their capital. Others again falling into dangers, and not willing to
give up a little have together with the substance lost their life
too.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXVIII-p76">Again, when it has been in men’s power to purchase
either gainful offices, or some other such thing, by some trifling
meanness they have lost all. For because they know not how to sow, but
have ever practised reaping, they of course continually fail of their
harvest. For no man can be always reaping, as neither can he be always
gaining. Therefore since they are not willing to spend, neither do they
know how to gain. And should they have to take a wife, the same thing
again befalls them; for either they are deceived into taking a poor
wife for a rich one, or when they have brought home one that is rich,
but full of faults without number, here too they have incurred more
loss than gain. For it is not superfluity but virtue, that causes
wealth. For what profit is there of her wealth, when she is expensive
and dissolute, and scatters all abroad more vehemently than any wind?
What if she be unchaste, and bring in numberless lovers? what if she be
drunken? Will she not quickly make her husband the poorest of men? But
they do not only marry, but also buy at great risk, from their great
covetousness, laboring to find not good slaves, but cheap ones.</p>

<p class="c53" id="iii.XXIX-p3"><i>“And He entered into a ship, and passed over,
and came into His own city. And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick
of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto
the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
thee.”</i><note n="1211" id="iii.XXIX-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p4">[R.V., accepting the same Greek text with

<p class="c12" id="iii.XXIX-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXIX-p5.1">By</span> His own city here he means
Capernaum. For that which gave Him birth was Bethlehem; that which
brought Him up, Nazareth; that which had Him continually inhabiting it,
Capernaum.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p6">This paralytic, however, was different from that one who
is set forth in John.<note n="1212" id="iii.XXIX-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p7"><scripRef passage="John v. 1" id="iii.XXIX-p7.1" parsed="|John|5|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.1">John v.

infirmity thirty and eight years, but concerning this, no such thing is
mentioned; and the other was in a state destitute of protectors, but
this had some to take care of him, who also took him up, and carried
him. And to this He saith, “Son, thy sins be forgiven
thee,”<note n="1213" id="iii.XXIX-p7.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p8">[R.V., accepting the same Greek text with
Chrysostom, “thy sins are forgiven.”—R.]</p></note>but to that He saith, “Wilt thou be made whole?”<note n="1214" id="iii.XXIX-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p9"><scripRef passage="John v. 6" id="iii.XXIX-p9.1" parsed="|John|5|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.6">John v.

for else the Jews would have laid this also to His charge; and in the
case of this man they were silent, but in that of the other they were
instant in persecuting him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p10">And this I have said, not without purpose, lest any one
should think there is a discrepancy from suspecting it to be one and
the same paralytic.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p11">But do thou, I pray thee, mark the humility and meekness
of our Lord. For He had also before this put away the multitudes from
Him, and moreover when sent away by them at Gadara, He withstood not,
but retired, not however to any great distance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p12">And again He entered into the ship and passed over, when
He might have gone over afoot. For it was His will not to be always
doing miracles, that He might not injure the doctrine of His
humanity.<note n="1215" id="iii.XXIX-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p13"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p13.1">τ τ

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p14">Now Matthew indeed saith, that “they brought
him,” but the others, that they also broke up the roof, and let
him down.<note n="1216" id="iii.XXIX-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p15"><scripRef passage="Mark ii. 4; Luke v. 19" id="iii.XXIX-p15.1" parsed="|Mark|2|4|0|0;|Luke|5|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.2.4 Bible:Luke.5.19">Mark ii. 4;

the whole to Him. For though in the beginning He Himself went about,
and did not require so much faith of them that came unto Him; yet in
this case they both approached Him, and had faith required on their
part. For, “Seeing,” it is said, “their faith;”
that is, the faith of them that had let the man down. For He doth not
on all occasions require faith on the part of the sick only: as for
instance, when they are insane, or in any other way, through their
disease, are out of their own control. Or rather, in this case the sick
man too had part in the faith; for he would not have suffered himself
to be let down, unless he had believed.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p16">Forasmuch then as they had evinced so great faith, He
also evinces His own power, with all authority absolving his sins, and
signifying in all ways that He is equal in honor with Him that begat
Him. And mark; He implied it from the beginning, by His teaching, when
He taught them as one having

<pb n="192" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_192.html" id="iii.XXIX-Page_192" />

authority; by the leper, when He said, “I
will, be thou clean,”<note n="1217" id="iii.XXIX-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p17"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 3" id="iii.XXIX-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|8|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.3">Matt. viii.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>by the centurion, when upon his saying, “Speak the word only, and
my servant shall be healed, He marvelled at him,”<note n="1218" id="iii.XXIX-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 8" id="iii.XXIX-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|8|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.8">Matt. viii.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>and celebrated him above all men; by the sea, when He curbed it with a
mere word; by the devils, when they acknowledged Him as their judge,
and He cast them out with great authority.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p19">Here again in another and a greater way He constrains
His very enemies to confess His equality in honor, and by their own
mouth He makes it manifest. For He, to signify His indifference to
honor (for there stood a great company of spectators shutting up the
entrance, wherefore also they let him down from above), did not
straightway hasten to heal the visible body, but He takes His occasion
from them; and He healed first that which is invisible, the soul, by
forgiving his sins; which indeed saved the other, but brought no great
glory to Himself. They themselves rather, troubled by their malice, and
wishing to assail Him, caused even against their will what was done to
be conspicuous. He, in fact, in His abundance of counsel, made use of
their envy for the manifestation of the miracle.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p20">Upon their murmuring,<note n="1219" id="iii.XXIX-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p21">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p21.1">ἐθορυβοντο</span>; a
stronger word than the Gospel narratives suggest. The translator tones
it down, as above.—R.]</p></note>then, and saying, “This man blasphemeth; who can forgive sins but
God only?”<note n="1220" id="iii.XXIX-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. 8.3; Mark 2.7" id="iii.XXIX-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|8|3|0|0;|Mark|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.3 Bible:Mark.2.7">Matt. viii. 3. Comp. Mark ii. 7</scripRef> [from which the latter part of the
citation is taken.—R.]</p></note>let us see what He saith. Did He indeed take away the suspicion? And
yet if He were not equal, He should have said, “Why fix upon me a
notion which is not convenient? I am far from this power.” But
now hath He said none of these things, but quite the contrary He hath
both affirmed and ratified, as well by His own voice, as by the
performance of the miracle. Thus, it appearing that His saying certain
things of Himself gave disgust to his hearers, He affirms what He had
to say concerning Himself by the others; and what is truly marvellous,
not by His friends only, but also by His enemies; for this is the
excellency of His wisdom. By His friends on the one hand, when He said,
“I will, be thou clean,”<note n="1221" id="iii.XXIX-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p23"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 3" id="iii.XXIX-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|8|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.3">Matt. viii.

Israel;”<note n="1222" id="iii.XXIX-p23.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 10" id="iii.XXIX-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|8|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.10">Matt. viii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note>but by His enemies, now. For because they had said, “No man can
forgive sins but God only,” He subjoined,</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p25">“But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath
power to forgive sins upon the earth (then saith He to the sick of the
palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go unto thine
house.”<note n="1223" id="iii.XXIX-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p26"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 6" id="iii.XXIX-p26.1" parsed="|Matt|8|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.6">Matt. viii.
6</scripRef>. [“Upon the
earth” is placed in this peculiar position by Chrysostom here. In
the next reference to the passage the correct order is
followed.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p27">And not here only, but also in another case again, when
they were saying, “For a good work we stone thee not, but for
blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself
God,”<note n="1224" id="iii.XXIX-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p28"><scripRef passage="John x. 33" id="iii.XXIX-p28.1" parsed="|John|10|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.33">John x.
33</scripRef>.</p></note>neither in that instance did He put down this opinion, but again
confirmed it, saying, “If I do not the works of my Father,
believe me not; but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the
works.”<note n="1225" id="iii.XXIX-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p29"><scripRef passage="John x. 37, 38" id="iii.XXIX-p29.1" parsed="|John|10|37|10|38" osisRef="Bible:John.10.37-John.10.38">John x. 37,
38</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p30">2. In this case indeed He discloses also another sign,
and that no small one, of His own Godhead, and of His equality in honor
with the Father. For whereas they said, “To unbind sins pertains
to God only,” He not only unbinds sins, but also before this He
makes another kind of display in a thing which pertained to God only;
the publishing the secrets in the heart. For neither had they uttered
what they were thinking.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p31">For “behold, certain of the scribes,” it
saith, “said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. And Jesus
knowing their thoughts, said, Wherefore think ye evil in your
hearts?”<note n="1226" id="iii.XXIX-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 3, 4" id="iii.XXIX-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|9|3|9|4" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.3-Matt.9.4">Matt. ix.

things, and it is man, and who shall know him?”<note n="1230" id="iii.XXIX-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p37"><scripRef passage="Jer. xvii. 9" id="iii.XXIX-p37.1" parsed="|Jer|17|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.17.9">Jer. xvii.

7</scripRef>.</p></note> And by many things one may see, that to know what is in the mind
belongs to God alone.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p39">Implying therefore that He is God, equal to Him that
begat Him; what things they were reasoning in themselves (for through
fear of the multitude, they durst not utter their mind), this their
opinion He unveils and makes manifest, evincing herein also His great
gentleness.<note n="1232" id="iii.XXIX-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p40"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p40.1">τ

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p41">“For wherefore,” saith He, “think ye
evil in your hearts?”<note n="1233" id="iii.XXIX-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 4" id="iii.XXIX-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.4">Matt. ix.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p43">And yet if there were cause for displeasure, it was the
sick man who should have been displeased, as being altogether deceived,
and should have said “One thing I came to have healed, and
amendest Thou another? Why, whence is it manifest that my sins are
forgiven?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p44">But now he for his part utters no such word, but gives
himself up to the power of

<pb n="193" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_193.html" id="iii.XXIX-Page_193" />

the
healer; but these being curious and envious, plot against the good
deeds of others. Wherefore He rebukes them indeed, but with all
gentleness. “Why, if ye disbelieve,” saith He, “what
went before, and account my saying a boast; behold I add to it also
another, the uncovering of your secrets; and after that again
another.” What then is this? The giving tone to the body of the
paralyzed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p45">And whereas, when He spake unto the sick of the palsy,
He spake without clearly manifesting His own authority: for He said
not, “I forgive thee thy sins,” but, “thy sins be
forgiven thee:” upon their constraining, He discloses His
authority more clearly, saying, “But that ye may know that the
Son of Man hath power<note n="1234" id="iii.XXIX-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p46">[R.V., margin, “authority;” compare the
next paragraph. On the order, see note 7, p. 196.—R.]</p></note>on earth to forgive sins.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p47">Seest thou, how far He was from unwillingness to be
thought equal to the Father? For He said not at all, “The Son of
Man hath need of another;” or, “He hath given Him
authority,” but, “He hath authority.” Neither doth He
say it for love of honor, but “to convince you,” so He
speaks, “that I do not blaspheme in making myself equal with
God.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p48">Thus everywhere His will is to offer proofs clear and
indisputable; as when He saith, “Go thy way, show thyself to the
priest;”<note n="1235" id="iii.XXIX-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p49"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 4" id="iii.XXIX-p49.1" parsed="|Matt|8|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.4">Matt. viii.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>and when He points to Peter’s wife’s mother ministering,
and permits the swine to cast themselves down headlong. And in the same
manner here also; first, for a certain token of the forgiveness of his
sins, He provides the giving tone to his body: and of that again, his
carrying his bed; to hinder the fact from being thought a mere fancy.
And He doeth not this, before He had asked them a question. “For
whether is easier,” saith He, “to say, Thy sins be forgiven
thee? or to say, Take up thy bed, and go unto thine house?”<note n="1236" id="iii.XXIX-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p50"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 5, 6" id="iii.XXIX-p50.1" parsed="|Matt|9|5|9|6" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.5-Matt.9.6">Matt. ix.
5, 6</scripRef>.</p></note> Now what He saith is like this, “Which seems to you easier, to
bind up a disorganized<note n="1237" id="iii.XXIX-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p51"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p51.1">δικισμνον</span>,
literally, “distributed into different habitations;” as
when the population of Mantinea was broken up by the
Lacedæmonians, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p51.2">δικσθη
Μαντινεα</span>: see Xen.
<i>Hellenic</i>, v. 2, 7; comp. Dem. <i>de Pace</i>, i. 59, ed. Reiske;
<i>de Fals. Leg</i>. i. 366.</p></note>body, or to undo<note n="1238" id="iii.XXIX-p51.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p52"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p52.1">λσαι</span>.</p></note>the sins of a soul? It is quite manifest; to bind up a body. For by how
much a soul is better than a body, by so much is the doing away sins a
greater work than this; but because the one is unseen, the other in
sight, I throw in that, which although an inferior thing, is yet more
open to sense; that the greater also and the unseen may thereby receive
its proof;” thus by His works anticipating even now the
revelation of what had been said by John, that “He taketh away
the sins of the world.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p53">Well then, having raised him up, He sends him to his
house; here again signifying His unboastfulness,<note n="1239" id="iii.XXIX-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p54">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p54.1">το
τυφον</span>.]</p></note>and that the event was not a mere imagination; for He makes the same
persons witnesses of his infirmity, and also of his health. For I
indeed had desired, saith He, through thy calamity to heal those also,
that seem to be in health, but are diseased in mind; but since they
will not, depart thou home, to heal them that are there.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p55">Seest thou how He indicates Him<note n="1240" id="iii.XXIX-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p56">[The reference here seems to be to God, but a
reflexive sense is not improbable; “indicates that He Himself
is,” etc.—R.]</p></note>to be Creator both of souls and bodies? He heals therefore the palsy in
each of the two substances, and makes the invisible evident by that
which is in sight. But nevertheless they still creep upon the
earth.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p57">“For when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled,
and glorified God, which” (it is said) “had given such
power unto men:”<note n="1241" id="iii.XXIX-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p58"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 8" id="iii.XXIX-p58.1" parsed="|Matt|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.8">Matt. ix. 8</scripRef>. [R.V., “they were afraid,”
for “they marvelled” (A.V.). But Chrysostom’s text
agrees with that of the received, followed by the A.V.]</p></note>for the flesh was an offense unto them.<note n="1242" id="iii.XXIX-p58.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p59"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXIX-p59.1">προσστατο
ατο</span>.</p></note> But He did not rebuke them, but proceeds by His works to arouse them,
and exalt their thoughts. Since for the time it was no small thing for
Him to be thought greater than all men, as having come from God. For
had they well established these things in their own minds, going on
orderly they would have known, that He was even the Son of God. But
they did not retain these things clearly, wherefore neither were they
able to approach Him. For they said again, “This man is not of
God;”<note n="1243" id="iii.XXIX-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXIX-p60"><scripRef passage="John ix. 16" id="iii.XXIX-p60.1" parsed="|John|9|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.16">John ix.
16</scripRef>.</p></note>“how is this man of God?” And they were continually harping
on these things, putting them forward as cloaks for their own
passions.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p61">3. Which thing many now also do; and thinking to avenge
God, fulfill their own passions, when they ought to go about all with
moderation. For even the God of all, having power to launch His
thunderbolt against them that blaspheme Him, makes the sun to rise, and
sends forth the showers, and affords them all other things in
abundance; whom we ought to imitate, and so to entreat, advise,
admonish, with meekness, not angry, not making ourselves wild
beasts.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p62">For no harm at all ensues unto God by their blasphemy,
that thou shouldest be angered, but he who blasphemed hath himself also
received the wound. Wherefore groan, bewail, for the calamity indeed
deserves tears. And the wounded man, again,—noth

ing can so heal him as gentleness: gentleness,
I say, which is mightier than any force.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p63">See, for example, how He Himself, the insulted one,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p68">And here again He said not, “O accursed, and
sorcerers as ye are; O ye envious, and enemies of men’s
salvation;” but, “Wherefore think ye evil in your
hearts?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p69">We must, you see, use gentleness to eradicate the
disease. Since he who is become better through the fear of man, will
quickly return to wickedness again. For this cause He commanded also
the tares to be left, giving an appointed day of repentance. Yea, and
many of them in fact repented, and became good, who before were bad; as
for instance, Paul, the Publican, the Thief; for these being really
tares turned into kindly wheat. Because, although in the seeds this
cannot be, yet in the human will it is both manageable and easy; for
our will is bound by no limits of nature, but hath freedom of choice
for its privilege.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXIX-p70">Accordingly, when thou seest an enemy of the truth, wait

amendment, in imitation of the best physicians. For neither do they
cure in one manner only, but when they see the wound not yield to the
first remedy, they add another, and after that again another; and now
they use the knife, and now bind up. And do thou accordingly, having
become a physician of souls, put in practice every mode of cure
according to Christ’s laws; that thou mayest receive the reward
both of saving thyself and of profiting others, doing all to the glory
of God, and so being glorified also thyself. “For them that

a man sitting at the receipt of custom,</i><note n="1250" id="iii.XXX-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p4">[R.V., “at the place of toll.”]</p></note><i>named Matthew; and He saith unto him, Follow me.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.XXX-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXX-p5.1">For</span> when He had performed the
miracle, He did not remain, lest, being in sight, He should kindle
their jealousy the more; but He indulges them by retiring, and soothing
their passion. This then let us also do, not encountering them that are
plotting against us; let us rather soothe their wound, giving way and
relaxing their vehemence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p6">But wherefore did He not call him together with Peter
and John and the rest? As in their case He had come at that time, when
He knew the men would obey Him; so Matthew also He then called when He
was assured he would yield himself. And therefore Paul again He took,
as a fisher his prey, after the resurrection. Because He who is
acquainted with the hearts, and knows the secrets of each man’s
mind, knew also when each of these would obey. Therefore not at the
beginning did He call him, when he was yet in

<pb n="195" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_195.html" id="iii.XXX-Page_195" />

rather a hardened state, but after His
countless miracles, and the great fame concerning Him, when He knew him
to have actually become more prepared for obedience.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p7">And we have cause also to admire the self-denial<note n="1251" id="iii.XXX-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p8"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p8.1">φιλοσοφαν</span>
.</p></note>of the evangelist, how he disguises not his own former life, but adds
even his name, when the others had concealed him under another
appellation.<note n="1252" id="iii.XXX-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p9"><scripRef passage="Mark ii. 14; Luke v. 27" id="iii.XXX-p9.1" parsed="|Mark|2|14|0|0;|Luke|5|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.2.14 Bible:Luke.5.27">Mark ii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p10">But why did he say he was “sitting at the receipt
of custom?” To indicate the power of Him that called him, that it
was not when he had left off or forsaken this wicked trade, but from
the midst of the evils He drew him up; much as He converted the blessed
Paul also when frantic and raging, and darting fire; which thing he
himself makes a proof of the power of Him that called him, saying to
the Galatians, “Ye have heard of my conversation in time past in
the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the
church of God.”<note n="1253" id="iii.XXX-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p11"><scripRef passage="Gal. i. 13" id="iii.XXX-p11.1" parsed="|Gal|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.1.13">Gal. i.
13</scripRef>.</p></note> And the fishermen too He called when they were in the midst of their
business. But that was a craft not indeed in bad report, but of men
rather rudely bred, not mingling with others, and endowed with great
simplicity; whereas the pursuit now in question was one full of all
insolence and boldness, and a mode of gain whereof no fair account
could be given, a shameless traffic, a robbery under cloak of law: yet
nevertheless He who uttered the call was ashamed of none of these
things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p12">And why talk I of His not being ashamed of a publican?
since even with regard to a harlot woman, so far from being ashamed to
call her, He actually permitted her to kiss His feet, and to moisten
them with her tears.<note n="1254" id="iii.XXX-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p13"><scripRef passage="Luke vii. 38" id="iii.XXX-p13.1" parsed="|Luke|7|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.38">Luke vii.
38</scripRef>.</p></note> Yea, for to this end He came, not to cure bodies only, but to heal
likewise the wickedness of the soul. Which He did also in the case of
the paralytic; and having shown clearly that He is able to forgive
sins, then, not before, He comes to him whom we are now speaking of;
that they might no more be troubled at seeing a publican chosen into
the choir of the disciples. For He that hath power to undo all our
offenses, why marvel if He even make this man an apostle?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p14">But as thou hast seen the power of Him that called, so
consider also the obedience of him that was called: how he neither
resisted, nor disputing said, “What is this? Is it not indeed a
deceitful calling, wherewith He calls me, being such as I am?”
nay; for this humility again had been out of season: but he obeyed
straightway, and did not even request to go home, and to communicate
with his relations concerning this matter; as neither indeed did the
fishermen; but as they left their net and their ship and their father,
so did he his receipt of custom and his gain, and followed, exhibiting
a mind prepared for all things; and breaking himself at once away from
all worldly things, by his complete obedience he bare witness that He
who called him had chosen a good time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p15">And wherefore can it be, one may say, that he hath not
told us of the others also, how and in what manner they were called;
but only of Peter and James, and John and Philip, and nowhere of the
others?<note n="1255" id="iii.XXX-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p16">It appears by this that St. Chrysostom did not
consider Nathanael to be the same with St. Bartholomew.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p17">Because these more than others were in so strange and
mean ways of life. For there is nothing either worse than the
publican’s business, or more ordinary than fishing. And that
Philip also was among the very ignoble, is manifest from his country.
Therefore these especially they proclaim to us, with their ways of
life, to show that we ought to believe them in the glorious parts of
their histories also. For they who choose not to pass by any of the
things which are accounted reproachful, but are exact in publishing
these more than the rest, whether they relate to the Teacher or to the
disciples; how can they be suspected in the parts which claim
reverence? more especially since many signs and miracles are passed
over by them, while the events of the cross, accounted to be
reproaches, they utter with exact care and loudly; and the
disciples’ pursuits too, and their faults, and those of their
Master’s ancestry who were notorious for sins,<note n="1256" id="iii.XXX-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 6" id="iii.XXX-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.6">Matt. iii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>they discover with a clear voice. Whence it is manifest that they made
much account of truth, and wrote nothing for favor, nor for
display.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p19">2. Having therefore called him, He also honored him with
a very great honor by partaking straightway of his table; for in this
way He would both give him good hope for the future, and lead him on to
a greater confidence.<note n="1257" id="iii.XXX-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p20"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p20.1">παησαν</span>.</p></note> For not in a long time, but at once, He healed his vice. And not with
him only doth He sit down to meat, but with many others also; although
this very thing was accounted a charge against Him, that He chased not
away the sinners. But neither do they conceal this point, what sort of
blame is endeavored to be fixed on His proceedings.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p21">Now the publicans come together as to one of the same
trade; for he, exulting<note n="1258" id="iii.XXX-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p22"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p22.1">ἐγκαλλωπιζμενο</span>
.</p></note>in the entrance of Christ, had called them all together. The fact is,
Christ used to try every kind of treatment; and not when discoursing
only, nor when healing, nor when reproving

<pb n="196" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_196.html" id="iii.XXX-Page_196" />

His enemies, but even at His morning meal, He would often
correct such as were in a bad way; hereby teaching us, that every
season and every work may by possibility afford us profit. And yet
surely what was then set before them came of injustice and
covetousness; but Christ refused not to partake of it, because the
ensuing gain was to be great: yea rather He becomes partaker of the
same roof and table with them that have committed such offenses. For
such is the quality of a physician; unless he endure the corruption of
the sick, he frees them not from their infirmity.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p23">And yet undoubtedly He incurred hence an evil report:
first by eating with him, then in Matthew’s house, and thirdly,
in company with many publicans. See at least how they reproach Him with
this. “Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of
publicans and sinners.”<note n="1259" id="iii.XXX-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 19" id="iii.XXX-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|11|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.19">Matt. xi.
19</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p25">Let them hear, as many as are striving to deck
themselves with great honor for fasting, and let them consider that our
Lord was called “a man gluttonous and a winebibber,” and He
was not ashamed, but overlooked all these things, that he might
accomplish what He had set before him; which indeed was accordingly
done. For the publican was actually converted, and thus became a better
man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p26">And to teach thee that this great thing was wrought by
his partaking of the table with Him, hear what Zacchæus saith,
another publican. I mean, when he heard Christ saying, “To-day, I
must abide in thy house,” the delight gave him wings, and he
saith, “The half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have
taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him
fourfold.”<note n="1260" id="iii.XXX-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p27"><scripRef passage="Luke xix. 5, 8, 9" id="iii.XXX-p27.1" parsed="|Luke|19|5|0|0;|Luke|19|8|0|0;|Luke|19|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.19.5 Bible:Luke.19.8 Bible:Luke.19.9">Luke xix.
5, 8, 9</scripRef>.</p></note> And to him Jesus saith, “This day is salvation come to this
house.” So possible is it by all ways to give instruction.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p28">But how is it, one may say, that Paul commands,
“If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous,
with such an one no, not to eat?”<note n="1261" id="iii.XXX-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p29"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 11" id="iii.XXX-p29.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.11">1 Cor. v.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> In the first place, it is not as yet manifest, whether to teachers also
he gives this charge, and not rather to brethren only. Next, these were
not yet of the number of the perfect,<note n="1262" id="iii.XXX-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p30"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p30.1">ἀπηρτισμνων</span>.</p></note>nor of those who had become brethren. And besides, Paul commands, even
with respect to them that had become brethren, then to shrink from
them, when they continue as they were, but these had now ceased, and
were converted.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p31">3. But none of these things shamed the Pharisees, but
they accuse Him to His disciples, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p32">“Why eateth your Master with publicans and
sinners?”<note n="1263" id="iii.XXX-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 11" id="iii.XXX-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|9|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.11">Matt. ix.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p34">And when the disciples seem to be doing wrong, they
intercede with Him, saying, “Behold thy disciples do that which
is not lawful to do on the sabbath-day;”<note n="1264" id="iii.XXX-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p35"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 2" id="iii.XXX-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|12|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.2">Matt. xii.
2</scripRef>.</p></note>but here to them they discredit Him. All which was the part of men
dealing craftily, and wishing to separate from the Master the choir of
the disciples. What then saith Infinite Wisdom?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p36">“They that be whole need not a physician,”
saith He, “but they that are sick.”<note n="1265" id="iii.XXX-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 12" id="iii.XXX-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.12">Matt. ix.
12</scripRef>. [R.V., “They that
are whole have no need of a physician.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p38">See how He turned their reasoning to the opposite
conclusion. That is, while they made it a charge against Him that He
was in company with these men: He on the contrary saith, that His not
being with them would be unworthy of Him, and of His love of man; and
that to amend such persons is not only blameless, but excellent, and
necessary, and deserving of all sorts of praise.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p39">After this, that He might not seem to put them that were
bidden to shame, by saying, “they that are sick;” see how
He makes up for it again, by reproving the others, and saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p40">“Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice.”<note n="1266" id="iii.XXX-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p41"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 13" id="iii.XXX-p41.1" parsed="|Matt|9|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.13">Matt. ix.
13</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p42">Now this He said, to upbraid them with their ignorance
of the Scriptures. Wherefore also He orders His discourse more sharply,
not Himself in anger, far from it; but so as that the publicans might
not be in utter perplexity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p43">And yet of course He might say, “Did ye not mark,
how I remitted the sins of the sick of the palsy, how I braced up his
body?” But He saith no such thing, but argues with them first
from men’s common reasonings, and then from the Scriptures. For
having said, “They that be whole need not a physician, but they
that are sick;” and having covertly indicated that He Himself was
the Physician; after that He said, “Go ye and learn what that
meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” Thus doth Paul
also: when he had first established his reasoning by illustrations from
common things, and had said, “Who feedeth a flock, and eateth not
of the milk thereof?”<note n="1267" id="iii.XXX-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p44"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 7" id="iii.XXX-p44.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.7">1 Cor. ix.

the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the
corn;”<note n="1268" id="iii.XXX-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p45"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 9" id="iii.XXX-p45.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.9">1 Cor. ix.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p47">But to His disciples not so, but He puts them in mind of
His signs, saying on this wise, “Do ye not yet remember the five
loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took
up?”<note n="1270" id="iii.XXX-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p48"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 9" id="iii.XXX-p48.1" parsed="|Matt|16|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.9">Matt. xvi.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> Not so however with these, but He reminds them of our common infirmity,
and signifies them at any rate to be of the number of the infirm; who
did not so much as know the Scriptures, but making light of the rest of
virtue, laid all the stress on their sacrifices; which thing He is also
earnestly intimating unto them, when He sets down in brief what had
been affirmed by all the prophets,<note n="1271" id="iii.XXX-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p49">See <scripRef passage="Hosea vi. 6; Ps. l. 8-15; Prov. xxi. 3; Isa. i. 11-15; Micah vi. 6, 7, 8" id="iii.XXX-p49.1" parsed="|Hos|6|6|0|0;|Ps|50|8|50|15;|Prov|21|3|0|0;|Isa|1|11|1|15;|Mic|6|6|6|8" osisRef="Bible:Hos.6.6 Bible:Ps.50.8-Ps.50.15 Bible:Prov.21.3 Bible:Isa.1.11-Isa.1.15 Bible:Mic.6.6-Mic.6.8">Hosea

6, 7, 8</scripRef>.</p></note>saying, “Learn ye what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p50">The fact is, He is signifying hereby that not He was
transgressing the law, but they; as if He had said, “Wherefore
accuse me? Because I bring sinners to amendment? Why then ye must
accuse the Father also for this.” Much as He said also elsewhere,
establishing this point: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I
work:”<note n="1272" id="iii.XXX-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p51"><scripRef passage="John v. 17" id="iii.XXX-p51.1" parsed="|John|5|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.17">John v.
17</scripRef>.</p></note>so here again, “Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice.” “For as this is His will, saith
Christ, so also mine.” Seest thou how the one is superfluous, the
other necessary? For neither did He say, “I will have mercy, and
sacrifice,” but, “I will have mercy, and not
sacrifice.” That is, the one thing He allowed, the other He cast
out; and proved that what they blamed, so far from being forbidden, was
even ordained by the law, and more so than sacrifice; and He brings in
the Old Testament, speaking words and ordaining laws in harmony with
Himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p52">Having then reproved them, both by common illustrations
and by the Scriptures, He adds again,</p>

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p55">And this He saith unto them in irony; as when He said,

“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”<note n="1276" id="iii.XXX-p57.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p58"><scripRef passage="Rom. iii. 23" id="iii.XXX-p58.1" parsed="|Rom|3|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.3.23">Rom. iii.

“Why, I am so far,” saith He, “from loathing sinners,
that even for their sakes only am I come.” Then, lest He should
make them more careless, He staid not at the word
“sinners,” but added, “unto repentance.”
“For I am not come that they should continue sinners, but that
they should alter, and amend.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p59">4. He then having stopped their mouths every way, as
well from the Scriptures as from the natural consequence of things; and
they having nothing to say, proved as they were obnoxious to the
charges which they had brought against Him, and adversaries of the law
and the Old Testament; they leave Him, and again transfer their
accusation to the disciples.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p60">And Luke indeed affirms that the Pharisees said it, but
this evangelist, that it was the disciples of John;<note n="1277" id="iii.XXX-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p61">Comp. <scripRef passage="Matt. 9.14; Luke 5.33; Mark 2.18" id="iii.XXX-p61.1" parsed="|Matt|9|14|0|0;|Luke|5|33|0|0;|Mark|2|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.14 Bible:Luke.5.33 Bible:Mark.2.18">Matt. ix. 14; Luke v. 33,
&amp;c., and Mark ii. 18</scripRef>,
&amp;c.</p></note>but it is likely that both said it. That is, they being, as might be
expected, in utter perplexity, take the other sort with them; as they
did afterwards with the Herodians likewise. Since in truth John’s
disciples were always disposed to be jealous of Him, and reasoned
against Him: being then only humbled, when first John abode in the
prison. They came at least then, “and told Jesus;”<note n="1278" id="iii.XXX-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p62">See <scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 12" id="iii.XXX-p62.1" parsed="|Matt|14|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.12">Matt.
xiv. 12</scripRef>.</p></note>but afterwards they returned to their former envy.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p63">Now what say they? “Why do we and the Pharisees
fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?”<note n="1279" id="iii.XXX-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p64"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 14" id="iii.XXX-p64.1" parsed="|Matt|9|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.14">Matt. ix.
14</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p65">This is the disease, which Christ long before was
eradicating, in the words, “When thou fastest, anoint thy head,
and wash thy face;”<note n="1280" id="iii.XXX-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p66"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 17" id="iii.XXX-p66.1" parsed="|Matt|6|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.17">Matt. vi.
17</scripRef>.</p></note>foreknowing the evils that spring therefrom. But yet He doth not rebuke
even these, nor say, “O ye vainglorious and over-busy;” but
He discourses to them with all gentleness, saying, “The children
of the bride-chamber cannot fast, as long as the bridegroom is with
them.”<note n="1281" id="iii.XXX-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p67"><scripRef passage="Matt. 9.15; Mark 2.19; Luke 5.33" id="iii.XXX-p67.1" parsed="|Matt|9|15|0|0;|Mark|2|19|0|0;|Luke|5|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.15 Bible:Mark.2.19 Bible:Luke.5.33">Matt. ix. 15. Comp. Mark ii. 19; Luke
v. 33</scripRef>.</p></note> Thus, when others were to be spoken for, the publicans I mean, to
soothe their wounded soul, He was more severe in His reproof of their
revilers; but when they were deriding Himself and His disciples, He
makes His reply with all gentleness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p68">Now their meaning is like this; “Granted,”
say they, “Thou doest this as a physician; why do Thy disciples
also leave fasting, and cleave to such tables?” Then, to make the
accusation heavier, they put themselves first, and then the Pharisees;
wishing by the comparison to aggravate the charge. For indeed
“both we,” it is said, “and the Pharisees, fast
oft.” And in truth they did fast, the one having learnt it from
John, the other

<pb n="198" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_198.html" id="iii.XXX-Page_198" />

from the law; even
as also the Pharisee said, “I fast twice in the week.”<note n="1282" id="iii.XXX-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p69"><scripRef passage="Luke xviii. 12" id="iii.XXX-p69.1" parsed="|Luke|18|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.12">Luke xviii.
12</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p70">What then saith Jesus? “Can the children of the
bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them.” Before, He
called Himself a physician, but here a bridegroom; by these names
revealing His unspeakable mysteries. Yet of course He might have told
them, more sharply, “These things depend not on you, that you
should make such laws. For of what use is fasting, when the mind is
full of wickedness; when ye blame others, when ye condemn them, bearing
about beams in your eyes, and do all for display? Nay, before all this
ye ought to have cast out vainglory, to be proficients in all the other
duties, in charity, meekness, brotherly love.” However, nothing
of this kind doth He say, but with all gentleness, “The children
of the bridechamber cannot fast, so long as the bridegroom is with
them;” recalling to their mind John’s words, when he said,
“He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom, but the friend of the
bridegroom, which standeth and heareth Him, rejoiceth greatly because
of the bridegroom’s voice.”<note n="1283" id="iii.XXX-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p71"><scripRef passage="John iii. 29" id="iii.XXX-p71.1" parsed="|John|3|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.29">John iii.
29</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p72">Now His meaning is like this: The present time is of joy
and gladness, therefore do not bring in the things which are
melancholy. For fasting is a melancholy thing, not in its own nature,
but to them that are yet in rather a feeble state; for to those at
least that are willing to practise self-command, the observance is
exceedingly pleasant and desirable. For as when the body is in health,
the spirits are high,<note n="1284" id="iii.XXX-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p73">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p73.1">πολλ
εφροσνη</span>.]</p></note>so when the soul is well conditioned, the pleasure is greater. But
according to their previous impression He saith this. So also Isaiah,<note n="1285" id="iii.XXX-p73.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p74">Lit., “humiliation.” <scripRef passage="Isa. lviii. 3; Numb. xxix. 7" id="iii.XXX-p74.1" parsed="|Isa|58|3|0|0;|Num|29|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.58.3 Bible:Num.29.7">Isa. lviii. 3; Numb. xxix. 7</scripRef>.</p></note>discoursing of it, calls it “an affliction of the soul;”
and Moses too in like manner.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p75">Not however by this only doth He stop their mouths, but
by another topic also, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p76">“Days will come, when the bridegroom shall be
taken from them, and then shall they fast.”<note n="1286" id="iii.XXX-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p77"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 15" id="iii.XXX-p77.1" parsed="|Matt|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.15">Matt. ix.
15</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p78">For hereby He signifies, that what they did was not of
gluttony, but pertained to some marvellous dispensation. And at the
same time He lays beforehand the foundation of what He was to say
touching His passion, in His controversies with others instructing His
disciples, and training them now to be versed in the things which are
deemed sorrowful. Because for themselves already to have this said to
them, would have been grievous and galling, since we know that
afterwards, being uttered, it troubled them;<note n="1287" id="iii.XXX-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p79"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 22, xvii. 23" id="iii.XXX-p79.1" parsed="|Matt|16|22|0|0;|Matt|17|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.22 Bible:Matt.17.23">Matt. xvi.
22, xvii. 23</scripRef>.</p></note>but spoken to others, it would become rather less intolerable to
them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p80">It being also natural for them to pride themselves on
John’s calamity, He from this topic represses likewise such their
elation: the doctrine however of His resurrection He adds not yet, it
not being yet time. For so much indeed was natural, that one supposed
to be a man should die, but that other was beyond nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p81">5. Then what He had done before, this He doth here
again. I mean, that as He, when they were attempting to prove Him
blameable for eating with sinners, proved to them on the contrary, that
His proceeding was not only no blame, but an absolute praise to Him: so
here too, when they wanted to show of Him, that He knows not how to
manage His disciples, He signifies that such language was the part of
men not knowing how to manage their inferences,<note n="1288" id="iii.XXX-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p82"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p82.1">κεχρσθαι το

the words, by way of rhetorical turn, here.</p></note>but finding fault at random.</p>

piece of new cloth unto an old garment.”<note n="1289" id="iii.XXX-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p84"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 15" id="iii.XXX-p84.1" parsed="|Matt|9|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.15">Matt. ix.

readings. It will be sufficient to refer to the R.V., and to note a few
verbal changes.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p85">He is again establishing His argument by illustrations
from common life. And what He saith is like this, “The disciples
have not yet become strong, but still need much condescension. They
have not yet been renewed by the Spirit, and on persons in that state
one ought not to lay any burden of injunctions.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p86">And these things He said, setting laws and rules for His
own disciples, that when they should have to receive as disciples those
of all sorts that should come from the whole world, they might deal
with them very gently.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p87">“Neither do men put new wine into old
bottles.”<note n="1290" id="iii.XXX-p87.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p88"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 17" id="iii.XXX-p88.1" parsed="|Matt|9|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.17">Matt. ix.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p89">Seest thou His illustrations, how like the Old
Testament? the garment? the wine skins? For Jeremiah too calls the
people “a girdle,” and makes mention again of
“bottles” and of “wine.”<note n="1291" id="iii.XXX-p89.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p90"><scripRef passage="Jer. xiii. 10-12" id="iii.XXX-p90.1" parsed="|Jer|13|10|13|12" osisRef="Bible:Jer.13.10-Jer.13.12">Jer. xiii.

ively, and do thou now turn from her, now flatter and court
her.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p93">Seest thou not the painters, how much they rub out, how
much they insert, when they are making a beautiful portrait? Well then,
do not thou prove inferior to these. For if these, in drawing the
likeness of a body, used such great diligence, how much more were it
meet for us, in fashioning a soul, to use every contrivance. For if
thou shouldest fashion well the form of this soul, thou wilt not see
the countenance of the body looking unseemly, nor lips stained, nor a
mouth like a bear’s mouth dyed with blood, nor eyebrows blackened
as with the smut of some kitchen vessel, nor cheeks whitened with dust
like the walls of the tombs. For all these things are smut, and
cinders, and dust, and signals of extreme deformity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p94">But stay: I have been led on unobserving, I know not
how, into these expressions; and while admonishing another to teach
with gentleness, I have been myself hurried away<note n="1293" id="iii.XXX-p94.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p95"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p95.1">ἐξεκυλσθην</span>
.</p></note>into wrath. Let us return therefore again unto the more gentle way of
admonition, and let us bear with all the faults of our wives, that we
may succeed in doing what we would. Seest thou not how we bear with the
cries of children, when we would wean them from the breast, how we
endure all for this object only, that we may persuade them to despise
their former food? Thus let us do in this case also, let us bear with
all the rest, that we may accomplish this. For when this hath been
amended, thou wilt see the other too proceeding in due order, and thou
wilt come again unto the ornaments of gold, and in the same way wilt
reason concerning them likewise, and thus by little and little bringing
thy wife unto the right rule, thou wilt be a beautiful painter, a
faithful servant, an excellent husbandman.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p96">Together with these things remind her also of the women
of old, of Sarah, of Rebecca, both of the fair and of them that were
not so, and point out how all equally practised modesty. For even Leah,
the wife of the patriarch, not being fair, was not constrained to
devise any such thing, but although she were uncomely, and not very
much beloved by her husband, she neither devised any such thing, nor
marred her countenance, but continued to preserve the lineaments
thereof undisfigured, and this though brought up by Gentiles.<note n="1294" id="iii.XXX-p96.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p97">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXX-p97.1">῾Ελλνων</span>; see note on Homily

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p98">But thou that art a believing woman, thou that hast
Christ for thine head, art thou bringing in upon us a satanic art? And
dost thou not call to mind the water that dashed over thy countenance,
the sacrifice that adorns thy lips, the blood that hath reddened thy
tongue? For if thou wouldest consider all these things, though thou
wert fond of dress to the ten thousandth degree, thou wilt not venture
nor endure to put upon thee that dust and those cinders. Learn that
thou hast been joined unto Christ, and refrain from this unseemliness.
For neither is He delighted with these colorings, but He seeks after
another beauty, of which He is in an exceeding degree a lover, I mean,
that in the soul. This the prophet likewise hath charged thee to
cherish, and hath said, “So shall the King have pleasure in thy
beauty.”<note n="1295" id="iii.XXX-p98.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXX-p99"><scripRef passage="Ps. xlv. 11" id="iii.XXX-p99.1" parsed="|Ps|45|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.45.11">Ps. xlv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p100">Let us not therefore be curious in making ourselves
unseemly. For neither is any one of God’s works imperfect, nor
doth it need to be set right by thee. For not even if to an image of
the emperor, after it was set up, any one were to seek to add his own
work, would the attempt be safe, but he will incur extreme danger. Well
then, man works and thou addest not; but doth God work, and dost thou
amend it? And dost thou not consider the fire of hell? Dost thou not
consider the destitution of thy soul? For on this account it is
neglected, because all thy care is wasted on the flesh.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p101">But why do I speak of the soul? For to the very flesh
everything falls out contrary to what ye have sought. Consider it. Dost
thou wish to appear beautiful? This shows thee uncomely. Dost thou wish
to please thy husband? This rather grieves him; and causes not him
only, but strangers also, to become thine accusers. Wouldest thou
appear young? This will quickly bring thee to old age. Wouldest thou
wish to array thyself honorably? This makes thee to be ashamed. For
such an one is ashamed not only before those of her own rank, but even
those of her maids who are in her secret, and those of her servants who
know; and, above all, before herself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p102">But why need I say these things? For that which is more
grievous than all I have now omitted, namely, that thou dost offend
God; thou underminest modesty, kindlest the flame of jealousy,
emulatest the harlot women at their brothel.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXX-p103">All these things then consider, ye women, and laugh to
scorn the pomp of Satan and the craft of the devil; and letting go this
adorning, or rather disfiguring, cultivate that beauty in your own
souls which is lovely even to angels and desired of God, and delightful

to your husbands; that ye may
attain both unto present glory, and unto that which is to come. To
which God grant that we may all attain, by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and
ever. Amen.</p>

then did He not take with Him Matthew, though he had but just come unto
Him? To bring him to a more earnest longing, and because he was yet
rather in an imperfect state. For to this intent doth He honor those,
that these may grow such as those are. But for him it sufficed for the
present, to see what befell the woman with the issue of blood, and to
be honored by His table, and by His partaking of his salt.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p13">And when He had risen up many followed Him, as for a
great miracle, both on account of the person who had come, and because
the more part being of a grosser disposition were seeking not so much
the care of the soul, as the healing of the body; and they flowed
together, some urged by their own afflictions, some hastening to behold
how other men’s were cured: however, there were as yet but few in
the habit of coming principally for the sake of His words and doctrine.
Nevertheless, He did not suffer them to enter into the house, but His
disciples only; and not even all of these, everywhere instructing us to
repel the applause of the multitude.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p14">2. “And, behold,” it is said, “a woman
that had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind Him, and touched
the hem of His garment. For she said within herself, If I may but touch
His garment, I shall be whole.”<note n="1301" id="iii.XXXI-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p15"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 21, 22" id="iii.XXXI-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|9|21|9|22" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.21-Matt.9.22">Matt. ix.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p16">Wherefore did she not approach Him boldly? She was
ashamed on account of her affliction, accounting herself to be unclean.
For if the menstruous woman was judged not to be clean, much more would
she have the same thought, who was afflicted with such a disease; since
in fact that complaint was under the law accounted a great
uncleanness.<note n="1302" id="iii.XXXI-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p17"><scripRef passage="Levit. xv. 25" id="iii.XXXI-p17.1" parsed="|Lev|15|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Lev.15.25">Levit. xv.

yet the proper and correct opinion concerning Him: else she

<pb n="201" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_201.html" id="iii.XXXI-Page_201" />

would not have thought to be concealed.
And this is the first woman that came unto Him in public, having heard
of course that He heals women also, and that He is on His way to the
little daughter that was dead.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p18">And she durst not invite Him to her house, although she
was wealthy;<note n="1303" id="iii.XXXI-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p19">Eusebius, E. H., viii. 18, mentions a tradition that
she belonged to Cæsarea Philippi, otherwise called Paneas, and
that certain brazen statues of a man holding out his hand and a woman
kneeling, which were there in his time, were set up at her expense,
that being her native place. He adds, that a certain plant which grew
by the Saviour’s statue, when it came to touch the hem of His
garment, stopped growing and that it was endowed with virtue to cure
all manner of diseases.</p></note>nay, neither did she approach publicly, but secretly with faith she
touched His garments. For she did not doubt, nor say in herself,
“Shall I indeed be delivered from the disease? shall I indeed
fail of deliverance?” But confident of her health, she so
approached Him. “For she said,” we read, “in herself,
If I may only touch His garment, I shall be whole.” Yea, for she
saw out of what manner of house He was come, that of the publicans, and
who they were that followed Him, sinners and publicans; and all these
things made her to be of good hope.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p20">What then doth Christ? He suffers her not to be hid, but
brings her into the midst, and makes her manifest for many
purposes.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p21">It is true indeed that some of the senseless ones say,
“He does this for love of glory. For why,” say they,
“did He not suffer her to be hid?” What sayest thou,
unholy, yea, all unholy one? He that enjoins silence, He that passes by
miracles innumerable, is He in love with glory?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p22">For what intent then doth He bring her forward? In the
first place He puts an end to the woman’s fear, lest being
pricked by her conscience, as having stolen the gift, she should abide
in agony. In the second place, He sets her right, in respect of her
thinking to be hid. Thirdly, He exhibits her faith to all, so as to
provoke the rest also to emulation; and His staying of the fountains of
her blood was no greater sign than He affords in signifying His
knowledge of all things. Moreover the ruler of the synagogue, who was
on the point of thorough unbelief, and so of utter ruin, He corrects by
the woman. Since both they that came said, “Trouble not the
Master, for the damsel is dead;” and those in the house laughed
Him to scorn, when He said, “She sleepeth;” and it was
likely that the father too should have experienced some such feeling.
Therefore to correct this weakness beforehand, He brings forward the
simple woman. For as to that ruler being quite of the grosser sort,
hear what He saith unto him: “Fear not, do thou believe only, and
she shall be made whole.”<note n="1304" id="iii.XXXI-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p23"><scripRef passage="Luke viii. 50" id="iii.XXXI-p23.1" parsed="|Luke|8|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.8.50">Luke viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p24">Thus He waited also on purpose for death to come on, and
that then He should arrive; in order that the proof of the resurrection
might be distinct. With this view He both walks more leisurely, and
discourses more with the woman; that He might give time for the damsel
to die, and for those to come, who told of it, and said, “Trouble
not the Master.”<note n="1305" id="iii.XXXI-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p25"><scripRef passage="Mark v. 35; Luke viii. 49" id="iii.XXXI-p25.1" parsed="|Mark|5|35|0|0;|Luke|8|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.5.35 Bible:Luke.8.49">Mark v. 35;
Luke viii. 49</scripRef>.</p></note> This again surely the evangelist obscurely signifies, when he saith,
“While He yet spake, there came from the house certain which
said, Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.” For His will
was that her death should be believed, that her resurrection might not
be suspected. And this He doth in every instance. So also in the case
of Lazarus, He waited a first and a second and a third day.<note n="1306" id="iii.XXXI-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p26"><scripRef passage="John xi. 6, 39" id="iii.XXXI-p26.1" parsed="|John|11|6|0|0;|John|11|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.6 Bible:John.11.39">John xi. 6,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p27">On account then of all these things He brings her
forward, and saith, “Daughter, be of good cheer,”<note n="1307" id="iii.XXXI-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. 9.22,2" id="iii.XXXI-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|9|22|0|0;|Matt|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.22 Bible:Matt.9.2">Matt. ix. 22; see verse 2</scripRef>.</p></note>even as He had said also to the paralyzed person, “Son, be of
good cheer.” Because in truth the woman was exceedingly alarmed;
therefore He saith, “be of good cheer,” and He calls her
“daughter;” for her faith had made her a daughter. After
that comes also her praise: “Thy faith hath made thee
whole.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p29">But Luke tells us also other things more than these
concerning the woman. Thus, when she had approached Him, saith he, and
had received her health, Christ did not immediately call her, but first
He saith, “Which is he that touched me?” Then when Peter
and they that were with Him said, Master, the multitude throng Thee,
and press Thee, and sayest Thou, who touched me?”<note n="1308" id="iii.XXXI-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p30"><scripRef passage="Luke viii. 45" id="iii.XXXI-p30.1" parsed="|Luke|8|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.8.45">Luke viii.
45</scripRef>.</p></note>(which was a very sure sign both that He was encompassed with real
flesh, and that He trampled on all vainglory, for they did not follow
Him at all afar off, but thronged Him on every side); He for His part
continued to say, “Somebody hath touched me, for I perceive that
virtue is gone out of me;”<note n="1309" id="iii.XXXI-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p31"><scripRef passage="Luke viii. 46" id="iii.XXXI-p31.1" parsed="|Luke|8|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.8.46">Luke viii.

“power.”]</p></note>answering after a grosser manner according to the impression of His
hearers. But these things He said, that He might also induce her of
herself to make confession. For on this account neither did He
immediately convict her, in order that having signified that He knows
all things clearly, He might induce her of her own accord to publish
all, and work upon her to proclaim herself what had been done, and that
He might not incur suspicion by saying it.</p>

<pb n="202" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_202.html" id="iii.XXXI-Page_202" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p32">Seest thou the woman superior to the ruler of the
synagogue? She detained Him not, she took no hold of Him, but touched
Him only with the end of her fingers, and though she came later, she
first went away healed. And he indeed was bringing the Physician
altogether to his house, but for her a mere touch suffered. For though
she was bound by her affliction, yet her faith had given her wings. And
mark how He comforts her, saying, “Thy faith hath saved
thee.” Now surely, had He drawn her forward for display, He would
not have added this; but He saith this, partly teaching the ruler of
the synagogue to believe, partly proclaiming the woman’s praise,
and affording her by these words delight and advantage equal to her
bodily health.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p33">For that He did this as minded to glorify her, and to
amend others, and not to show Himself glorious, is manifest from hence;
that He indeed would have been equally an object of admiration even
without this (for the miracles were pouring around Him faster than the
snow-flakes, and He both had done and was to do far greater things than
these): but the woman, had this not happened, would have gone away hid,
deprived of those great praises. For this cause He brought her forward,
and proclaimed her praise, and cast out her fear, (for “she
came,” it is said, “trembling”<note n="1310" id="iii.XXXI-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p34"><scripRef passage="Luke viii. 47" id="iii.XXXI-p34.1" parsed="|Luke|8|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.8.47">Luke viii.

has been modified to indicate more exactly the words
cited.—R.]</p></note>); and He caused her to be of good courage, and together with health of
body, He gave her also other provisions for her journey, in that He
said, “Go in peace.”<note n="1311" id="iii.XXXI-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p35"><scripRef passage="Luke viii. 48" id="iii.XXXI-p35.1" parsed="|Luke|8|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.8.48">Luke viii.

laughed Him to scorn.”<note n="1312" id="iii.XXXI-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 23, 24" id="iii.XXXI-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|9|23|9|24" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.23-Matt.9.24">Matt. ix.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p38">Noble tokens, surely, these, of the rulers of
synagogues; in the moment of her death pipes and cymbals raising a
dirge! What then doth Christ? All the rest He cast out, but the parents
He brought in; to leave no room for saying that He healed her in any
other way. And before her resurrection too, He raises her in His word;
saying, “The maid is not dead, but sleepeth.” And in many
instances besides He doeth this. As then on the sea He expels tumult
from the mind of the by-standers, at the same time both signifying that
it is easy for Him to raise the dead (which same thing He did with
respect to Lazarus also, saying, “Our friend Lazarus
sleepeth<note n="1313" id="iii.XXXI-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p39"><scripRef passage="John xi. 11" id="iii.XXXI-p39.1" parsed="|John|11|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.11">John xi.

death, but is henceforth become a sleep. Thus, since He Himself was to
die, He doth in the persons of others prepare His disciples beforehand
to be of good courage, and to bear the end meekly. Since in truth, when
He had come, death was from that time forward a sleep.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p40">But yet they laughed Him to scorn: He however was not
indignant at being disbelieved by those for whom He was a little
afterwards to work miracles; neither did He rebuke their laughter, in
order that both it and the pipes, and the cymbals, and all the other
things, might be a sure proof of her death. For since for the most
part, after the miracles are done, men disbelieve, He takes them
beforehand by their own answers; which was done in the case both of
Lazarus and of Moses. For to Moses first He saith, “What is that
in thine hand?”<note n="1314" id="iii.XXXI-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p41"><scripRef passage="Ex. iv. 2" id="iii.XXXI-p41.1" parsed="|Exod|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.4.2">Ex. iv.

that it was a rod before, but being reminded of his own saying, might
be amazed at what was done. And with regard to Lazarus He saith,
“Where have ye laid him?”<note n="1315" id="iii.XXXI-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p42"><scripRef passage="John xi. 34, 39" id="iii.XXXI-p42.1" parsed="|John|11|34|0|0;|John|11|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.34 Bible:John.11.39">John xi.

stinketh, for he hath been dead four days,” might no longer be
able to disbelieve His having raised a dead man.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p43">Seeing then the cymbals and the multitude, He put them
all out, and in the presence of the parents works the miracle; not
introducing another soul, but recalling the same that had gone out, and
awakening her as it were out of a sleep.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p44">And He holds her by the hand, assuring the beholders; so
as by that sight to make a way for the belief of her resurrection. For
whereas the father said, “Lay thy hand upon her;”<note n="1316" id="iii.XXXI-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 18" id="iii.XXXI-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|9|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.18">Matt. ix.
18</scripRef>.</p></note> He on His part doth somewhat more, for He lays no hand on her, but
rather takes hold of her, and raises her, implying that to Him all
things are ready. And He not only raises her up, but also commands to
give her meat, that the event might not seem to be an illusion. And He
doth not give it Himself, but commands them; as also with regard to
Lazarus He said, “Loose him, and let him go,”<note n="1317" id="iii.XXXI-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p46"><scripRef passage="John xi. 44" id="iii.XXXI-p46.1" parsed="|John|11|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.44">John xi.

completeness the demonstration alike of the death and of the
resurrection.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p48">But do thou mark, I pray thee, not her resurrection
only, but also His commanding “to tell no man;” and by all
learn thou this especially, His freedom from haughtiness

and vainglory. And withal learn this other
thing also, that He cast them that were beating themselves out of the
house, and declared them unworthy of such a sight; and do not thou go
out with the minstrels, but remain with Peter, and John, and James.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p49">For if He cast them out then, much more now. For then it
was not yet manifest that death was become a sleep, but now this is
clearer than the very sun itself. But is it that He hath not raised thy
daughter now? But surely He will raise her, and with more abundant
glory. For that damsel, when she had risen, died again; but thy child,
if she rise again, abides thenceforth in immortal being.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p50">4. Let no man therefore beat himself any more, nor wail,

amend it by lamentations;” art not thou, who hearest sayings
wiser and better than these, ashamed to behave thyself more unseemly
than they? For we say not at all, “Bear it manfully, because it
is not possible to undo what hath taken place,” but, “bear
it manfully, because he will surely rise again;” the child sleeps
and is not dead; he is at rest and hath not perished. For resurrection
will be his final lot, and eternal life, and immortality, and an

wickedness, not thee, who art going to be crowned and to rest. Yea, for

than he? Many, for instance, among the Greeks<note n="1327" id="iii.XXXI-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p65">[Or, “Gentiles.”]</p></note>although they knew nothing of course about immortality, have crowned
themselves at the decrease of their children, and appeared in white
garments,

that they might reap the
present glory; but thou not even for the future glory’s sake
ceasest thy woman’s behavior and wailing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p66">But hast thou no heirs, nor any to succeed to thy goods?
And which wouldest thou rather, that he should be heir of thy
possessions, or of Heaven? And which didst thou desire, that he should
succeed to the things that perish, which he must have let go soon
after, or to things that remain, and are immoveable? Thou hadst him not
for heir, but God had him instead of thee; he became not joint-heir
with his own brethren, but he became “joint-heir with
Christ.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p67">“But to whom,” saith he, “are we to
leave our garments, to whom our houses, to whom our slaves and our
lands?” To him again, and more securely than if he lived; for
there is nothing to hinder. For if barbarians burn the goods of the
departed together with them, much more were it a righteous thing for
thee to send away with the dead what things he hath: not to be turned
to ashes, like those, but to invest him with more glory; and that if he
departed a sinner, it may do away his sins;<note n="1328" id="iii.XXXI-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p68">Not that St. Chrysostom imagined that anything could
be done to change the relative condition of those who have died in the
favor or displeasure of God: see <i>e.g</i>., Hom. XXXVI. p. 506, ed.
Field. Indeed, the same is implied in the words which immediately
follow. “Dost thou long to see him? Then live the same life with
him,” &amp;c.</p></note>but if righteous, that it may become an increase of reward and
recompense.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p69">But dost thou long to see him? Then live the same life
with him, and thou wilt soon obtain that sacred vision.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p70">And herewith consider this also, that though thou
shouldest not hearken to us, thou wilt certainly yield to time. But no
reward then for thee; for the consolation comes of the number of the
days. Whereas if thou art willing now to command thyself, thou wilt
gain two very great points: first, thou wilt deliver thyself from the
intervening ills, next, thou wilt be crowned with the brighter crown
from God. For indeed neither almsgiving nor anything else is nearly so
great as bearing affliction meekly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p71">Bear in mind, that even the Son of God died: and He
indeed for thee, but thou for thyself. And when He said, “If it
be possible, let the cup pass from me,”<note n="1329" id="iii.XXXI-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p72"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 39" id="iii.XXXI-p72.1" parsed="|Matt|26|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.39">Matt. xxvi.
39</scripRef>.</p></note>and suffered pain, and was in agony, nevertheless He shunned not the
end, but underwent it, and that with its whole course of exceeding
woe.<note n="1330" id="iii.XXXI-p72.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p73"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXI-p73.1">μετ
πολλ τ
τραγδα</span>.</p></note> That is, He did by no means simply endure death, but the most shameful
death; and before His death, stripes; and before His stripes,
upbraidings, and jeers, and revilings; instructing thee to bear all
manfully. And though He died, and put off His body, He resumed it again
in greater glory, herein also holding out to thee good hopes. If these
things be not a fable, lament not. If thou account these things to be
sure, weep not; but if thou dost weep, how wilt thou be able to
persuade the Greek that thou believest?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p74">6. But even so doth the event still appear intolerable
to thee? Well then, for this very cause it is not meet to lament for
him, for he is delivered from many such calamities. Grudge not
therefore against him, neither envy him: for to ask death for yourself
because of his premature end, and to lament for him that he did not
live to endure many such things, is rather the part of one grudging and
envying.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p75">And think not of this, that he will no more return home:
but that thyself also art a little while after to go to him. Regard not
this, that he returns here no more, but that neither do these things
that are seen remain such as they are, but these too are being
transformed. Yea, for heaven, and earth, and sea, and all, are being
put together afresh,<note n="1331" id="iii.XXXI-p75.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p76"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXI-p76.1">μεθαρμζεται</span>
.</p></note>and then shalt thou recover thy child in greater glory.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p77">And if indeed he departed a sinner, his wickedness is
stayed; for certainly, had God known that he was being converted, He
would not have snatched him away before his repentance: but if he ended
his life righteous, he now possesses all good in safety. Whence it is
manifest that thy tears are not of kindly affection, but of unreasoning
passion. For if thou lovedst the departed, thou shouldest rejoice and
be glad that he is delivered from the present waves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p78">For what is there more, I pray thee? What is there fresh
and new? Do we not see the same things daily revolving? Day and night,
night and day, winter and summer, summer and winter, and nothing more.
And these indeed are ever the same; but our evils are fresh, and newer.
Wouldest thou then have him every day drawing up more of these things,
and abiding here, and sickening, and mourning, and in fear and
trembling, and enduring some of the ills of life, dreading others lest
he some time endure them? Since assuredly thou canst not say this, that
one sailing over this great sea might possibly be free from despondency
and cares, and from all other such things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p79">And withal take this also into account, that thou didst
not bring him forth immortal; and that if he had not died now, he must
have endured it soon after. But is it that thou hadst not thy fill of
him? But thou wilt of a

<pb n="205" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_205.html" id="iii.XXXI-Page_205" />

certainty
enjoy him there. But longest thou to see him here also? And what is
there to hinder thee? For thou art permitted even here, if thou be
watchful; for the hope of the things to come is clearer than sight.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p80">But thou, if he were in some king’s court wouldest
not ever seek to see him, so long as thou heardest of his good report:
and seeing him departed to the things that are far better, art thou
faint-hearted about a little time; and that, when thou hast in his
place one to dwell with thee?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p81">But hast thou no husband? yet hast thou a consolation,
even the Father of the orphans, and Judge of the widows. Hear even Paul
pronouncing this widowhood blessed, and saying, “Now she that is
a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in the Lord.”<note n="1332" id="iii.XXXI-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p82"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. v. 5" id="iii.XXXI-p82.1" parsed="|1Tim|5|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.5.5">1 Tim. v.

hope set on God.” Chrysostom reads <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXI-p82.2">κριον</span>, and Augustin followed the
same reading.—R.]</p></note> Because such an one will appear more approved, evincing as she doth
greater patience. Mourn not therefore for that which is thy crown, that
for which thou demandest a reward.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p83">Since thou hast also restored His deposit, if thou hast
exhibited the very thing entrusted to thee. Be not in care any more,
having laid up the possession in an inviolable treasure-house.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p84">But if thou wouldest really learn, both what is our
present being, and what our life to come; and that the one is a
spider’s web and a shadow, but the things there, all of them,
immoveable and immortal; thou wouldest not after that want other
arguments. For whereas now thy child is delivered from all change; if
he were here, perhaps he might continue good, perhaps not so. Seest
thou not how many openly cast off<note n="1333" id="iii.XXXI-p84.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXI-p85"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXI-p85.1">ἀποκηρττουσι</span>
.</p></note>their own children? how many are constrained to keep them at home,
although worse than the open outcasts?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXI-p86">Let us make account of all these things and practise
self-command; for so shall we at once show regard to the deceased, and
enjoy much praise from men, and receive from God the great rewards of
patience, and attain unto the good things eternal; unto which may we
all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

that cometh from the multitude. For because the house was near, He
leads them thither to heal them in private. And this is evident from
the fact, that He charged them moreover to tell no man.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p8">But this is no light charge against the Jews; when these
men, though their eyes were struck out, receive the faith by hearing
alone, but they beholding the miracles, and having their sight to
witness what was happening, do all just contrary. And see their
earnestness also, both by their cry, and by their prayer itself. For
they did not merely approach Him, but with loud cries, and alleging
nought else but “mercy.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p9">And they called Him “Son of David,” because
the name was thought to be honorable. In many passages, for instance,
did the prophets<note n="1337" id="iii.XXXII-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p10">Perhaps <scripRef passage="Isa. xxxvii. 35" id="iii.XXXII-p10.1" parsed="|Isa|37|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.37.35">Isa. xxxvii. 35</scripRef>.</p></note>likewise so call the kings, whom

<pb n="206" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_206.html" id="iii.XXXII-Page_206" />

they wished to honor, and to declare great.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p11">And having brought them into the house, He puts to them
a further question. For in many cases He made a point of healing on
entreaty, lest any should suppose Him to be rushing<note n="1338" id="iii.XXXII-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p12"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXII-p12.1">ἑπιπδν</span>.</p></note>upon these miracles through vainglory: and not on this account alone,
but to indicate also that they deserve healing, and that no one should
say, “If it was of mere mercy that He saved, all men ought to be
saved.” For even His love to man hath a kind of proportion;
depending on the faith of them that are healed. But not for these
causes only doth He require faith of them, but forasmuch as they called
Him “Son of David,” He to lead them up to what is higher,
and to teach them to entertain the imaginations they ought of Himself,
saith, “Believe ye that I am able to do this?” He did not
say, “Believe ye that I am able to entreat my Father, that I am
able to pray” but, “that I am able to do this?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p13">What then is their word? “Yea, Lord.” They
call Him no more Son of David, but soar higher, and acknowledge His
dominion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p14">And then at last He for His part lays His hand upon
them, saying, “According to your faith be it unto you.” And
this He doth to confirm their faith, and to show that they are
participators in the good work, and to witness that their words were
not words of flattery. For neither did He say, “Let your eyes be
opened,” but, “According to your faith be it unto
you;” which He saith to many of them that came unto Him; before
the healing of their bodies, hastening to proclaim the faith in their
soul; so as both to make them more approved, and to render others more
serious.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p15">Thus with respect to the sick of the palsy also; for
there too before giving nerve to the body, He raises up the fallen
soul, saying, “Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven
thee.”<note n="1339" id="iii.XXXII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 2" id="iii.XXXII-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.2">Matt. ix.

by the food taught her her Benefactor; and in the case of the centurion
also He did in like manner, leaving the whole to his faith; and as to
His disciples again, when delivering them from the storm on the sea, He
delivered them first from their want of faith. Just so likewise in this
case: He knew indeed, even before their cry, the secrets of their mind;
but that He might lead on others also to the same earnestness, He makes
them known to the rest as well, by the result of their cure proclaiming
their hidden faith.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p17">Then after their cure He commands them to tell no man;
neither doth He merely command them, but with much strictness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p18">“For Jesus,” it is said, “straitly
charged them, saying, See that no man know it. But they, when they were

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p20">They however did not endure this, but became preachers,
and evangelists; and when bidden to hide what had been done, they
endured it not.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p21">And if in another place we find Him saying, “Go
thy way, and declare the glory of God,”<note n="1341" id="iii.XXXII-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p22"><scripRef passage="Mark v. 19; Luke viii. 39" id="iii.XXXII-p22.1" parsed="|Mark|5|19|0|0;|Luke|8|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.5.19 Bible:Luke.8.39">Mark v. 19;

For He instructs us to say nothing ourselves, concerning ourselves, but
even to forbid them that would eulogise us: but if the glory be
referred to God, then not only not to forbid, but to command men to do
this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p23">2. “And as they went out,” it is said,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p25">For the affliction was not natural, but the device of
the evil spirit; wherefore also he needs others to bring him. For he
could neither make entreaty himself, being speechless, nor supplicate
others, when the evil spirit had bound his tongue, and together with
his tongue had fettered his soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p26">For this cause neither doth He require faith of him, but
straightway heals the disease.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p27">“For when the devil was cast out,” it saith,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p29">Now this especially vexed the Pharisees, that they
preferred Him to all, not only that then were, but that had ever been.
And they preferred Him, not for His healing, but for His doing it
easily and quickly, and to diseases innumerable and incurable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p30">And thus the multitude; but the Pharisees quite
contrariwise; not only disparaging the works, but saying things
contradictory to themselves, and not ashamed. Such a thing is
wickedness. For what say they?</p>

devils.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p33">What can be more foolish than this? For in the first
place, as He also saith further on, it is impossible that a devil
should cast out a devil, for that being is wont to repair what belongs
to himself, not to pull it down. But

<pb n="207" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_207.html" id="iii.XXXII-Page_207" />

He did not cast out devils only, but also
cleansed lepers, and raised the dead, and curbed the sea, and remitted
sins, and preached the kingdom, and brought men unto the Father; things
which a demon would never either choose, or at any time be able to
effect. For the devils bring men to idols, and withdraw them from God,
and persuade them to disbelieve the life to come. The devil doth not
bestow kindness when he is insulted; forasmuch as even when not
insulted, he harms those that court and honor him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p34">But He doeth the contrary. For after these their insults
and revilings,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p35">3. “He went about,” it is said, “all
the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching
the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every
disease.”<note n="1345" id="iii.XXXII-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p36"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 35" id="iii.XXXII-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|9|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.35">Matt. ix.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p37">And so far from punishing them for their insensibility,
He did not even simply rebuke them; at once both evincing His meekness,
and so refuting the calumny; and at the same time minded also by the
signs which followed to exhibit His proof more completely: and then to
adduce also the refutation by words. He went about therefore both in
cities, and in countries, and in their synagogues; instructing us to
requite our calumniators, not with fresh calumnies, but with greater
benefits. Since, if not for man’s sake, but God’s, thou
doest good to thy fellow-servants; whatsoever they may do, leave not
thou off doing them good, that thy reward may be greater; since he
surely, who upon their calumny leaves off his doing good, signifies
that for their praise’ sake, not for God’s sake, he applies
himself to that kind of virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p38">For this cause Christ, to teach us that of mere goodness
He had entered on this, so far from waiting for the sick to come to
Him, of Himself hastened unto them, bearing them two of the greatest
blessings; one, the gospel of the kingdom; another, the perfect cure of
all their diseases. And not a city did He overlook, not a village did
He hasten by, but visited every place.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p39">4. And not even at this doth He stop, but He exhibits
also another instance of His forethought. That is,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p40">“When He saw,” it is said, “the
multitudes, He was moved with compassion on them, because they were

[“will” is unnecessary.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p43">See again His freedom from vainglory. That He may not
draw all men unto Himself, He sends out His disciples.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p44">And not with this view only, but that He might also
teach them, after practising in Palestine, as in a sort of
training-school, to strip themselves for their conflicts with the
world. For this purpose then He makes the exercises even more serious
than the actual conflicts, so far as pertained to their own virtue;
that they might more easily engage in the struggles that were to ensue;
as it were a sort of tender nestlings whom He was at length leading out
to fly. And for the present He makes them physicians of bodies,
dispensing to them afterwards the cure of the soul, which is the
principal thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p45">And mark how He points out the facility and necessity of
the thing. For what saith He? “The harvest truly is plenteous,
but the laborers are few.” That is, “not to the
sowing,” saith He, “but to the reaping do I send
you.” Which in John He expressed by, “Other men labored,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p47">And these things he said, at once repressing their
pride, and preparing them to be of good courage, and signifying that
the greater part of the labor came first.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p48">And contemplate Him here too beginning from love to man,
not with any requital. “For He had compassion, because they were
troubled and scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.” This
is His charge against the rulers of the Jews, that being shepherds they
acted the part of wolves. For so far from amending the multitude, they
even marred their progress. For instance, when they were marvelling and
saying, “It was never so seen in Israel:” these were
affirming the contrary, “He casteth out devils through the prince
of the devils.”<note n="1349" id="iii.XXXII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p49"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 23, 24" id="iii.XXXII-p49.1" parsed="|Matt|12|23|12|24" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.23-Matt.12.24">Matt. xii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p50">But of what laborers doth He speak here? Of the twelve
disciples. What then? whereas He had said, “But the laborers are
few,” did He add to their number? By no means, but He sent them
out alone. Wherefore then did He say, “Pray ye the Lord of the
harvest, that He would<note n="1350" id="iii.XXXII-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p51">[Omit “would.”]</p></note>send forth laborers into His harvest;” and made no addition to
their number? Because though they were but twelve, He made them many
from that time

forward, not by
adding to their number, but by giving them power.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p52">Then to signify how great the gift is, He saith,
“Pray ye the Lord of the harvest;” and indirectly declares
it to be His own prerogative. For after having said, “Pray ye the
Lord of the harvest;” when they had not made any entreaty nor
prayer, He Himself at once ordains them, reminding them also of the
sayings of John,<note n="1351" id="iii.XXXII-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p53"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 12" id="iii.XXXII-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.12">Matt. iii.

and of the wheat. Whence it is evident that Himself is the husbandman,
Himself the Lord of the harvest, Himself the master and owner of the
prophets. For if He sent them to reap, clearly it was not to reap what
belongs to another, but what Himself had sown by the prophets.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p54">But not in this way only was He indirectly encouraging
them, in calling their ministry a harvest; but also by making them able
for the ministry.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p55">“And when He had called unto Him,” it saith,
“His twelve disciples, He gave them power against<note n="1352" id="iii.XXXII-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p56">[R.V., “authority over.”]</p></note>unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p58">Still the Spirit was not yet given. For “there was
not yet,” it saith, “a Spirit, because that Jesus was not
yet glorified.”<note n="1354" id="iii.XXXII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p59"><scripRef passage="John vii. 39" id="iii.XXXII-p59.1" parsed="|John|7|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.39">John vii.

authority.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p60">And mark, I pray thee, also, how well timed was the
mission. For not at the beginning did He send them; but when they had
enjoyed sufficiently the advantage of following Him, and had seen a
dead person raised, and the sea rebuked, and devils expelled, and a
paralytic new-strung, and sins remitted, and a leper cleansed, and had
received a sufficient proof of His power, both by deeds and words, then
He sends them forth: and not to dangerous acts, for as yet there was no
danger in Palestine, but they had only to stand against evil speakings.
However, even of this He forewarns them, I mean of their perils;
preparing them even before the time, and making them feel as in
conflict by His continual predictions of that sort.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p61">5. Then, since He had mentioned to us two pairs of
apostles, that of Peter, and that of John, and after those had pointed
out the calling of Matthew, but had said nothing to us either of the
calling or of the name of the other apostles; here of necessity He sets
down the list of them, and their number, and makes known their names,
saying thus:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p62">“Now the names of the twelve apostles are these;
first, Simon, who is called Peter.”<note n="1355" id="iii.XXXII-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p63"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 2" id="iii.XXXII-p63.1" parsed="|Matt|10|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.2">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p64">Because there was also another Simon, the Canaanite; and
there was Judas Iscariot, and Judas the brother of James; and James the
son of Alphæus, and James the son of Zebedee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p65">Now Mark doth also put them according to their dignity;
for after the two leaders, He then numbers Andrew; but our evangelist
not so, but without distinction; or rather He sets before himself even
Thomas who came far short of him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p66">But let us look at the list of them from the
beginning.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p67">“First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his
brother.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p68">Even this is no small praise. For the one he named from
his virtue, the other from his high kindred, which was in conformity to
his disposition.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p69">Then, “James the son of Zebedee, and John his
brother.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p70">Seest thou how He arranges them not according to their
dignity. For to me John seems to be greater, not only than the others,
but even than his brother.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p71">After this, when he had said, “Philip, and
Bartholomew,” he added, “Thomas, and Matthew the
Publican.”<note n="1356" id="iii.XXXII-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p72"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 3" id="iii.XXXII-p72.1" parsed="|Matt|10|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.3">Matt. x.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p73">But Luke not so, but in the opposite order, and he puts
him before Thomas.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p74">Next, “James the son of Alphæus.” For
there was, as I have already said, the son of Zebedee also. Then after
having mentioned “Lebbæus, whose surname was

“Lebbæus,” though it is not strongly supported, mainly

Canaanite,” he comes to the traitor. And not as a sort of enemy
or foe, but as one writing a history, so hath he described him. He
saith not, “the unholy, the all unholy one,” but hath named
him from his city, “Judas Iscariot.” Because there was also
another Judas, “Lebbæus, whose surname was
Thaddæus,” who, Luke saith, was the brother of James,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p84">What manner of men were these? The fishermen, the
publicans: for indeed four were fishermen and two publicans, Matthew
and James, and one was even a traitor. And what saith He to them? He
presently charges them, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p85">“Go not into the way<note n="1363" id="iii.XXXII-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p86">[R.V., “<i>any</i> way.”]</p></note>of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not; but

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p88">“For think not at all,” saith He,
“because they insult me, and call me demoniac, that I hate them
and turn away from them. Nay, as I sought earnestly to amend them in
the first place, so keeping you away from all the rest, to them do I
send you as teachers and physicians. And I not only forbid you to
preach to others before these, but I do not suffer you so much as to
touch upon the road that leads thither, nor to enter into such a
city.” Because the Samaritans too are in a state of enmity with
the Jews. And yet it was an easier thing to deal with them, for they
were much more favorably disposed to the faith; but the case of these
was more difficult. But for all this, He sends them on the harder task,
indicating his guardian care of them, and stopping the mouths of the
Jews, and preparing the way for the teaching of the apostles, that
people might not hereafter blame them for “entering in to men
uncircumcised,”<note n="1365" id="iii.XXXII-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p89"><scripRef passage="Acts xi. 3" id="iii.XXXII-p89.1" parsed="|Acts|11|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.11.3">Acts xi.

calls them “lost,” not “stray,”
“sheep,” in every way contriving how to excuse them, and
winning their mind to himself.</p>

before them, but of some new and strange things. For while the former
preached no such things, but earth, and the good things in the earth,
these preached the kingdom of Heaven, and whatever is there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p93">And not from this circumstance only were these the
greater, but also from their obedience: in that they shrink not, nor

having nothing to preach that is dismal or grievous, they readily
obeyed?” What sayest thou? nothing grievous enjoined them? Dost
thou not hear of the prisons, the executions, the civil wars, the
hatred of all men? all which, He said a little while after, they must
undergo. True, as to other men, He sent them to be procurers and
heralds of innumerable blessings: but for themselves, He said and
proclaimed beforehand, that they were to suffer terrible and incurable
ills.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p100">See how He provides for their conduct, and that no less
than for their miracles, implying that the miracles without this are
nothing. Thus He both quells their pride by saying, “Freely ye

“freely ye have received.” “Ye bestow no favor on

to them also, for there is no finding a price worthy of

poses; first setting His
disciples above suspicion; secondly, freeing them from all care, so
that they might give all their leisure to the word; thirdly, teaching
them His own power. Of this accordingly He quite speaks out to them

when He had said, “Cleanse the lepers, cast out devils,”

give;” by His way of ordering things consulting at once for their
interest, their credit, and their ability.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p109">But perhaps some one may say, that the rest may not be
unaccountable, but “not to have a scrip for the journey, neither
two coats, nor a staff, nor shoes,” why did He enjoin this? Being
minded to train them up unto all perfection; since even further back,
He had suffered them not to take thought so much as for the next day.
For even to the whole world He was to send them out as teachers.
Therefore of men He makes them even angels (so to speak); releasing
them from all worldly care, so that they should be possessed with one
care alone, that of their teaching; or rather even from that He
releases them, saying, “Take no thought how or what ye shall
speak.”<note n="1374" id="iii.XXXII-p109.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p110"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 19" id="iii.XXXII-p110.1" parsed="|Matt|10|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.19">Matt. x.

this He shows to be especially light and easy for them. For nothing

command us to live by begging?” and be ashamed of this, He
signifies the thing to be a debt, both by calling them
“workmen,” and by terming what was given,
“hire.”<note n="1378" id="iii.XXXII-p116.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p117">See <scripRef passage="Luke x. 7" id="iii.XXXII-p117.1" parsed="|Luke|10|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.7">Luke x.

words, that the benefit conferred by you is small; nay, for the thing
hath much toil; and whatsoever they that are taught may give, it is not
a free gift which they bestow, but a recompence which they render:
“for the workman is worthy of his meat.” But this He said,
not as declaring so much to be the worth of the apostles’ labors,
far from it; God forbid: but as both making it a law for them to seek
nothing more, and as convincing the givers, that what they do is not an
act of liberality, but a debt.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p121">And He not only requires them to seek out worthy
persons, but also not to change house for house, whereby they would
neither vex him that is receiving them, nor themselves get the
character of gluttony and self-indulgence.<note n="1380" id="iii.XXXII-p121.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p122"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXII-p122.1">εκολα</span>.</p></note> For this He declared by saying, “There abide till ye go

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p124">Seest thou how He made them honorable by this also, and
those that received them careful; by signifying that they rather are
the gainers, both in honor, and in respect of advantage?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p125">Then pursuing again the same subject, He saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p126">“And when ye come into an house, salute it. And if
the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not
worthy, let your peace return to you.”<note n="1382" id="iii.XXXII-p126.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p127"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 12, 13" id="iii.XXXII-p127.1" parsed="|Matt|10|12|10|13" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.12-Matt.10.13">Matt. x.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p128">Seest thou how far He declines not to carry His
injunctions? And very fitly. For as champions of godliness, and
preachers to the whole world, was He training them. And in that regard
disposing them to practise moderation, and making them objects of love,
He saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p129">“And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear
your words, when ye depart out of that

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p131">That is, “do not,” saith He, “because
ye are teachers, therefore wait to be saluted by others, but be first
in showing that respect.” Then, implying that this is not a mere
salutation, but a blessing, He saith, “If the house be worthy, it
shall come upon it,” but if it deal insolently, its first
punishment will be, not to have the benefit of your peace; and the
second, that it shall suffer the doom of Sodom.” “And
what,” it will be said, “is their punishment to us?”
Ye will have the houses of such as are worthy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p132">But what means, “Shake off the dust of your
feet?” It is either to signify their having received nothing of
them, or to be a witness to them of the long journey, which they had
travelled for their sake.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p133">But mark, I pray thee, how He doth not even yet give the
whole to them. For neither doth He as yet bestow upon them
foreknowledge, so as to learn who is worthy, and who is not so; but He
bids them inquire, and await the trial. How then did He Himself abide
with a publican? Because he was become worthy by his conversion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p134">And mark, I pray thee, how when He had stripped them of
all, He gave them all, by suffering them to abide in the houses of
those who became disciples, and to enter therein, having nothing. For
thus both themselves were freed from anxiety, and they would convince
the others, that for their salvation only are they come; first by
bringing in nothing with them, then by requiring no more of them than
necessaries, lastly, by not entering all their houses without
distinction.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p135">Since not by the signs only did He desire them to appear
illustrious, but even before the signs, by their own virtue. For
nothing so much characterizes strictness of life,<note n="1384" id="iii.XXXII-p135.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p136"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXII-p136.1">φιλοσοφαν</span>
.</p></note>as to be free from superfluities, and so far as may be, from wants.
This even the false apostles knew. Wherefore Paul also said,
“That wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.”<note n="1385" id="iii.XXXII-p136.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p137"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 12" id="iii.XXXII-p137.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.12">2 Cor. xi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p138">But if when we are in a strange country, and are going
unto persons unknown to us, we must seek nothing more than our food for
the day, much more when abiding at home.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p139">9. These things let us not hear only, but also imitate.
For not of the apostles alone are they said, but also of the saints
afterwards. Let us therefore become worthy to entertain them. For
according to the disposition of the entertainers this peace both comes
and flies away again. For not only on the courageous speaking of them
that teach, but also on the worthiness of them that receive, doth this
effect follow.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p140">Neither let us account it a small loss, not to enjoy
such peace. For this peace the prophet also from of old proclaims,
saying, “How beautiful are the feet of them that bring good
tidings of peace.”<note n="1386" id="iii.XXXII-p140.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p141"><scripRef passage="Isa. lii. 7; Rom. x. 15" id="iii.XXXII-p141.1" parsed="|Isa|52|7|0|0;|Rom|10|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.52.7 Bible:Rom.10.15">Isa. lii.

eos qui primum Pascha jejunant</i>, P. vi. 383. Sav. “There is
nothing like peace and harmony. Therefore our Father (the Bishop)
mounts not up to this throne, until he have invoked peace upon you all:
nor when he stands up, doth he begin his instruction to you, until he
have given peace to all; and the priests, when about to consecrate,
first make this prayer for you, and so begin the blessing: and the
deacon also, when he bids you pray, joins this with the rest as matter
of your prayer, that you should ask for the angel of peace, and that
all the things set before you should be for your peace: also in
dismissing you from this assembly, this is what he implores for you,
saying, ‘Depart in peace.’ And in a word, we may not say or
do any thing without this peace.” See also Bingham, 14, 4, 6; 4,
14; 15, 3, 1, 2; and the authors quoted by him, especially St.
Chrysostom in various places: from which it is evident that “the
table” here means the holy table, and that his argument is,
“We should receive our brethren’s salutations as home and
elsewhere with a brotherly mind, that we may be fit to impart to him
the kiss of peace in the holy mysteries: the one is a type of, and a
preparation for, the other: as was the salutation here enjoined to the
apostles. Especially ought we to be ready and attentive at the many
salutations which the ministers offer to us in the earlier part of the
service, that we may lose none of the benefit of that mysterious
salutation which we know will come in the end and most awful part of
it.”</p></note> And this which we speak of is a type of that. And you should receive it
with all alacrity, in heart<note n="1389" id="iii.XXXII-p144.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p145">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXII-p145.1">τ

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p148">For thee the presbyter sits, for thee the teacher
stands, laboring and toiling. What plea then wilt thou have, for not
affording him so much welcome as to listen to Him? For indeed the
church is the common home of all, and when ye have first occupied it,
we enter in, strictly observing the type which they exhibited. For this
cause we also pronounce “peace” in common to all, directly
as we enter, according to that law.</p>

this house is of greater dignity; our great possessions being verily

occur in church history, and illustrate the importance which the early
writers attribute to the sacred oil in the church ritual, and the
account of the miracle of St. Narcissus in Euseb. E. H. vi. 9. This
statement of St. Chrysostom should be borne in mind, as qualifying what
he so often seems to affirm or imply, that miraculous gifts had been
withdrawn.</p></note>in faith and in due season. And this coffer too is far better and more
indispensable than that other chest; for it hath not clothes but alms

is more delightful than any couch.</p>

several homes, let us at least, when we meet here, be earnest in so
doing. Because though in all other things we be destitute and poor, yet
in these we are rich. Wherefore here at least receive us with love when
we come in unto you. And when I say, “Peace be unto you,”<note n="1398" id="iii.XXXII-p156.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p157">See St. Chrys. on Coloss. Hom. III. (as quoted by
Mr. Field). “When the bishop enters the church, immediately he
says, ‘Peace be to all;’ when he exhorts, ‘Peace to
all;’ when he consecrates, ‘Peace to all,’ when he
enjoins the salutation, ‘Peace to all;’ when the sacrifice
is ended, ‘Peace to all;’ and at intervals again,
‘Grace to you and Peace.’”</p></note>and ye say, “And with thy spirit,” say it not with the
voice only, but also with the mind; not in mouth, but in understanding
also. But if, while here thou sayest, “Peace also to thy
spirit,” out of doors thou art mine enemy, spitting at and
calumniating me, and secretly aspersing me with innumerable reproaches;
what manner of peace is this?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p158">For I indeed, though thou speak evil of me ten thousand
times, give thee that peace with a pure heart, with sincerity of
purpose, and I can say nothing evil at any time of thee; for I have a
father’s bowels. And if I rebuke thee at any time, I do it out of
concern for thee. But as for thee, by thy secret carping at me, and not
receiving me in the Lord’s house, I fear lest thou shouldest in
return add to my despondency; not for thine insulting me, not for thy
casting me out, but for thy rejecting our peace, and drawing down upon
thyself that grievous punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p159">For though I shake not off the dust, though I turn not
away, what is threatened remains unchanged. For I indeed oftentimes
pronounce peace to you, and will not cease from continually speaking
it; and if, besides your insults, ye receive me not, even then I shake
not off the dust; not that I am disobedient to our Lord, but that I
vehemently burn for you. And besides, I have suffered nothing at all
for you; I have neither come a long journey, nor with that garb and
that voluntary poverty am I come (therefore we first blame ourselves),
nor without shoes and a second coat; and perhaps this is why ye also
fail of your part. However, this is not a sufficient plea for you; but
while our condemnation is greater, to you it imparts no excuse.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p160">10. Then the houses were churches, but now the church is
become a house. Then one might say nothing worldly in a house, now one
may say nothing spiritual in a church, but even here ye bring in the
business from the market place, and while God is discoursing, ye leave
off listening in silence to His sayings, and bring in the contrary
things, and make discord. And I would it were your own affairs, but now
the things which are nothing to you, those ye both speak and hear.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p161">For this I lament, and will not cease lamenting. For I
have no power to quit this house, but here we must needs remain until
we depart from this present life. “Receive us”<note n="1399" id="iii.XXXII-p161.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p162"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 2" id="iii.XXXII-p162.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.2">2 Cor. vii.

not to a meal, but to the temper and mind. This we also seek of you,
even love, that fervent and genuine affection. But if ye endure not
even this, at least love yourselves, and lay aside your present
remissness. This is sufficient for our consolation, if we see you
approving yourselves, and becoming better men. So will I also myself
show forth increased love, even “though the more abundantly I
love you, the less I be loved.”<note n="1400" id="iii.XXXII-p162.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p163"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 15" id="iii.XXXII-p163.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.15">2 Cor. xii.

the less?” The reading accepted by Chrysostom agrees better with
this interpretation.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p164">For indeed there are many things to bind us together.
One table is set before all, one

<pb n="213" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_213.html" id="iii.XXXII-Page_213" />

Father begat us, we are all the issue of the
same throes, the same drink hath been given to all; or rather not only
the same drink, but also to drink out of one cup. For our Father
desiring to lead us to a kindly affection, hath devised this also, that
we should drink out of one cup; a thing which belongs to intense
love.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p165">But “there is no comparison between the apostles
and us.” I confess it too, and would never deny it. For I say
not, to themselves, but not even to their shadows are we
comparable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p166">But nevertheless, let your part be done. This will have
no tendency to disgrace you but rather to profit you the more. For when
even to unworthy persons ye show so much love and obedience, then shall
ye receive the greater reward.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p167">For neither are they our own words which we speak, since
ye have no teacher at all on earth; but what we have received, that we
also give, and in giving we seek for nothing else from you, but to be
loved only. And if we be unworthy even of this, yet by our loving you
we shall quickly be worthy. Although we are commanded to love not them
only that love us, but even our enemies. Who then is so hardhearted,
who so savage, that after having received such a law, he should abhor
and hate even them that love him, full as he may be of innumerable
evils?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p168">We have partaken of a spiritual table, let us be
partakers also of spiritual love. For if robbers, on partaking of salt,
forget their character; what excuse shall we have, who are continually
partaking of the Lord’s body, and do not imitate even their
gentleness? And yet to many, not one table only, but even to be of one
city, hath sufficed for friendship; but we, when we have the same city,
and the same house, and table, and way, and door, and root, and life,
and head, and the same shepherd, and king, and teacher, and judge, and
maker, and father, and to whom all things are common; what indulgence
can we deserve, if we be divided one from another?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p169">11. But the miracles, perhaps, are what ye seek after,
such as they wrought when they entered in; the lepers cleansed, the
devils driven out, and the dead raised? Nay, but this is the great
indication of your high birth, and of your love, that ye should believe
God without pledges. And in fact this, and one other thing, were the
reasons why God made miracles to cease. I mean, that if when miracles
are not performed, they that plume themselves on other
advantages,—for instance, either on the word of wisdom, or on
show of piety,—grow vainglorious, are puffed up, are separated
one from another; did miracles also take place, how could there but be
violent rendings? And that what I say is not mere conjecture, the
Corinthians bear witness, who from this cause were divided into many
parties.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p170">Do not thou therefore seek signs, but the soul’s
health. Seek not to see one dead man raised; nay, for thou hast learnt
that the whole world is arising. Seek not to see a blind man healed,
but behold all now restored unto that better and more profitable sight;
and do thou too learn to look chastely, and amend thine eye.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p171">For in truth, if we all lived as we ought, workers of
miracles would not be admired so much as we by the children of the
heathen. For as to the signs, they often carry with them either a
notion of mere fancy, or another evil suspicion, although ours be not
such. But a pure life cannot admit of any such reproach; yea, all
men’s mouths are stopped by the acquisition of virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p172">Let virtue then be our study: for abundant are her
riches, and great the wonder wrought in her. She bestows the true
freedom, and causes the same to be discerned even in slavery, not
releasing from slavery, but while men continue slaves, exhibiting them
more honorable than freemen; which is much more than giving them
freedom: not making the poor man rich, but while he continues poor,
exhibiting him wealthier than the rich.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p173">But if thou wouldest work miracles also, be rid of
transgressions, and thou hast quite accomplished it. Yea, for sin is a
great demon, beloved; and if thou exterminate this, thou hast wrought a
greater thing than they who drive out ten thousand demons. Do thou
listen to Paul, how he speaks, and prefers virtue to miracles.

yet show I unto you a more excellent way.”<note n="1401" id="iii.XXXII-p173.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXII-p174"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 31" id="iii.XXXII-p174.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.31">1 Cor. xii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p179">For, as to miracles, they oftentimes, while they
profited another, have injured him who had the power, by lifting him up
to pride and vainglory, or haply in some other way: but in our works
there is no place for any such suspicion, but they profit both such as
follow them, and many others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p180">These then let us perform with much diligence. For if
thou change from inhumanity to almsgiving, thou hast stretched forth
the hand that was withered. If thou withdraw from theatres and go to
the church, thou hast cured the lame foot. If thou draw back thine eyes
from an harlot, and from beauty not thine own, thou hast opened them
when they were blind. If instead of satanical songs, thou hast learnt
spiritual psalms, being dumb, thou hast spoken.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXII-p181">These are the greatest miracles, these the wonderful
signs. If we go on working these signs, we shall both ourselves be a
great and admirable sort of persons through these, and shall win over
all the wicked unto virtue, and shall enjoy the life to come; unto
which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XXXIII-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXXIII-p4.1">Having</span> made them feel confident
about their necessary food, and opened unto them all men’s
houses, and having invested their entrance with an appearance to
attract veneration, charging them not to come in as wanderers, and
beggars, but as much more venerable than those who received them (for
this He signifies by His saying, “the workman is worthy of his
hire;” and by His commanding them to inquire, who was worthy, and
there to remain, and enjoining them to salute such as receive them; and
by His threatening such as receive them not with those incurable
evils): having I say, in this way cast out their anxiety, and armed
them with the display of miracles, and made them as it were all iron
and adamant, by delivering them from all worldly things, and
enfranchising them from all temporal care: He speaks in what follows of
the evils also that were to befall them; not only those that were to
happen soon after, but those too that were to be in long course of
time; from the first, even long beforehand, preparing them for the war
against the devil. Yea, and many advantages were hence secured; and
first, that they learnt the power of His foreknowledge; secondly, that
no one should suspect, that through weakness of their Master came these
evils upon them; thirdly, that such as undergo these things should not
be dismayed by their falling out unexpectedly, and against hope;
fourthly, that they might not at the very time of the cross be troubled
on hearing these things. For indeed, they were just so affected at that
time; when also He upbraided them, saying, “Because I have said
these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your hearts; and none of you
asketh me, whither goest Thou?”<note n="1406" id="iii.XXXIII-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p5"><scripRef passage="John xvi. 6, 5" id="iii.XXXIII-p5.1" parsed="|John|16|6|0|0;|John|16|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.6 Bible:John.16.5">John xvi.

be bound, and scourged, and put to death, that He might not hereby also
confound their minds; but for the present He announces before what
should happen to themselves.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p6">Then, that they might learn that this system of war is
new, and the manner of the array unwonted; as He sends them bare, and
with one coat, and unshod, and without staff, and without girdle or
scrip, and bids them be maintained by such as receive them; so neither
here did He stay His speech, but to

<pb n="215" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_215.html" id="iii.XXXIII-Page_215" />

signify His unspeakable power, He saith,
“Even thus setting out, exhibit the gentleness of
“sheep,” and this, though ye are to go unto
“wolves;” and not simply unto wolves, but “into the
midst of wolves.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p7">And He bids them have not only gentleness as sheep, but
also the harmlessness of the dove. “For thus shall I best show
forth my might, when sheep get the better of wolves, and being in the
midst of wolves, and receiving a thousand bites, so far from being
consumed, do even work a change on them a thing far greater and more
marvellous than killing them, to alter their spirit, and to reform
their mind; and this, being only twelve, while the whole world is
filled with the wolves.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p8">Let us then be ashamed, who do the contrary, who set
like wolves upon our enemies. For so long as we are sheep, we conquer:
though ten thousand wolves prowl around, we overcome and prevail. But
if we become wolves, we are worsted, for the help of our Shepherd
departs from us: for He feeds not wolves, but sheep: and He forsakes
thee, and retires, for neither dost thou allow His might to be shown.
Because, as He accounts the whole triumph His own, if thou being ill
used, show forth gentleness; so if thou follow it up and give blows,
thou obscurest His victory.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p9">2. But do thou consider, I pray thee, who they are that
hear these injunctions, so hard and laborious: the timid and ignorant;
the unlettered and uninstructed; such as are in every respect obscure,
who have never been trained up in the Gentile laws, who do not readily
present themselves in the public places; the fishermen, the publicans,
men full of innumerable deficiencies. For if these things were enough
to confound even the lofty and great, how were they not enough to cast
down and dismay them that were in all respects untried, and had never
entertained any noble imagination? But they did not cast them down.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p10">“And very naturally,” some one may perhaps
say; “because He gave them power to cleanse lepers, to drive out
devils.” I would answer as follows: Nay, this very thing was
enough especially to perplex them, that for all their raising the dead,
they were to undergo these intolerable evils, both judgments, and
executions, and the wars which all would wage on them, and the common
hatred of the world; and that such terrors await them, while themselves
are working miracles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p11">3. What then is their consolation for all these things?
The power of Him that sends them. Wherefore also He puts this before
all, saying, “Behold, I send you.” This suffices for your
encouragement, this for confidence, and fearing none of your
assailants.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p12">Seest thou authority? seest thou prerogative? seest thou
invincible might? Now His meaning is like this: “Be not
troubled” (so He speaks), “that sending you among wolves, I
command you to be like sheep and like doves. For I might indeed have
done the contrary, and have suffered you to undergo nothing terrible,
nor as sheep to be exposed to wolves; I might have rendered you more
formidable than lions; but it is expedient that so it should be. This
makes you also more glorious; this proclaims also my power.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p13">This He said also unto Paul: “My grace is
sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in
weakness.”<note n="1407" id="iii.XXXIII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p14"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9" id="iii.XXXIII-p14.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9">2 Cor. xii.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>“It is I, now mark it, who have caused you so to be.” For
in saying, “I send you forth as sheep,” He intimates this.
“Do not therefore despond, for I know, I know certainly, that in
this way more than any other ye will be invincible to all.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p15">After this, that they may contribute something on their
own part also, and that all might not seem to be of His grace, nor they
supposed to be crowned at random, and vainly, He saith, “Be ye
therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” “But
what,” it might be said, “will our wisdom avail in so great
dangers? nay, how shall we be able to have wisdom at all, when so many
waves are drenching us all over? For let a sheep be ever so wise, when
it is in the midst of wolves, and so many wolves, what will it be able
to do? Let the dove be ever so harmless, what will it profit, when so
many hawks are assailing it?” In the brutes indeed, not at all:
but in you as much as possible.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p16">But let us see what manner of wisdom He here requires.
That of the serpent, He saith. For even as that animal gives up
everything, and if its very body must be cut off, doth not very
earnestly defend it, so that it may save its head; in like manner do
thou also, saith He, give up every thing but the faith; though goods,
body, life itself, must be yielded. For that is the head and the root;
and if that be preserved, though thou lose all, thou wilt recover all
with so much the more splendor.<note n="1408" id="iii.XXXIII-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p17"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIII-p17.1">περιφανεα</span>
.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p18">On this account then He neither commanded to be merely a
simple and single-hearted sort of person, nor merely wise; but hath
mixed up both these, so that they may become virtue; taking in the
wisdom of the

<pb n="216" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_216.html" id="iii.XXXIII-Page_216" />

serpent that we may
not be wounded in our vitals; and the harmlessness of the dove, that we
may not retaliate on our wrongdoers, nor avenge ourselves on them that
lay snares; since wisdom again is useless, except this be added. Now
what, I ask, could be more strict than these injunctions? Why, was it
not enough to suffer wrong? Nay, saith He, but I do not permit thee so
much as to be indignant. For this is “the dove.” As though
one should cast a reed into fire, and command it not to be burnt by the
fire, but to quench it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p19">However, let us not be troubled; nay, for these things
have come to pass, and have had an accomplishment, and have been shown
in very deed, and men became wise as serpents, and harmless as doves;
not being of another nature, but of the same with us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p20">Let not then any one account His injunctions
impracticable. For He beyond all others knows the nature of things; He
knows that fierceness is not quenched by fierceness, but by gentleness.
And if in men’s actual deeds too thou wouldest see this result,
read the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and thou wilt see how often,
when the people of the Jews had risen up against them and were
sharpening their teeth, these men, imitating the dove, and answering
with suitable meekness, did away with their wrath, quenched their
madness, broke their impetuosity. As when they said, “Did not we
straitly command you, that ye should not speak in this
name?”<note n="1409" id="iii.XXXIII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p21"><scripRef passage="Acts v. 28" id="iii.XXXIII-p21.1" parsed="|Acts|5|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.5.28">Acts v.
28</scripRef>.</p></note>although able to work any number of miracles, they neither said nor did
anything harsh, but answered for themselves with all meekness, saying,
“Whether it be right to hearken unto you more than unto God,
judge ye.”<note n="1410" id="iii.XXXIII-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p22"><scripRef passage="Acts iv. 19" id="iii.XXXIII-p22.1" parsed="|Acts|4|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.19">Acts iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p23">Hast thou seen the harmlessness of the dove? Behold the
wisdom of the serpent. “For we cannot but speak the things, which
we know and have heard.”<note n="1411" id="iii.XXXIII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p24"><scripRef passage="Acts iv. 20" id="iii.XXXIII-p24.1" parsed="|Acts|4|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.20">Acts iv.

abased by dangers, nor provoked by anger?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p25">4. Therefore He said also,<note n="1412" id="iii.XXXIII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p26"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 17, 18" id="iii.XXXIII-p26.1" parsed="|Matt|10|17|10|18" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.17-Matt.10.18">Matt. x.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p27">“Beware of men, for they shall deliver you up to
councils, and they shall scourge you in their synagogues: and ye shall
be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to
them and the Gentiles.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p28">Thus again is He preparing them to be vigilant, in every
case assigning to them the sufferance of wrong, and permitting the
infliction of it to others; to teach thee that the victory is in
suffering evil, and that His glorious trophies are thereby set up. For
He said not at all, “Fight ye also, and resist them that would
vex you,” but only, “Ye shall suffer the utmost
ills.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p29">O how great is the power of Him that speaks! How great
the self-command of them that hear! For indeed we have great cause to
marvel, how they did not straightway dart away from Him on hearing
these things, apt as they were to be startled at every sound, and such
as had never gone further than that lake, around which they used to
fish; and how they did not reflect, and say to themselves, “And
whither after all this are we to flee? The courts of justice against
us, the kings against us, the governors, the synagogues of the Jews,
the nations of the Gentiles, the rulers, and the ruled.” (For
hereby He not only forewarned them of Palestine, and the ills therein,
but discovered also the wars throughout the world, saying, “Ye
shall be brought before kings and governors;” signifying that to
the Gentiles also He was afterwards to send them as heralds.)
“Thou hast made the world our enemy, Thou hast armed against us
all them that dwell on the earth, peoples, tyrants, kings.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p30">And what follows again is much more fearful, since men
are to become on our account murderers of brothers, of children, of
fathers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p31">“For the brother,” saith He, “shall
deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and children
shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to
death.”<note n="1413" id="iii.XXXIII-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 21" id="iii.XXXIII-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|10|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.21">Matt. x.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p33">“How, then,” one might say, “will the
rest of men believe, when they see on our account, children slain by
their fathers, and brethren by brethren, and all things filled with
abominations?” What? will not men, as though we were destructive
demons, will they not, as though we were devoted, and pests of the
world, drive us out from every quarter, seeing the earth filled with
blood of kinsmen, and with so many murderers? Surely fair is the peace
(is it not?) which we are to bring into men’s houses and give
them, while we are filling those houses with so many slaughters. Why,
had we been some great number of us, instead of twelve; had we been,
instead of “unlearned and ignorant,” wise, and skilled in
rhetoric, and mighty in speech; nay more, had we been even kings, and
in possession of armies and abundance of wealth; how could we have
persuaded any, while kindling up civil wars, yea, and other wars far
worse than they? Why, though we were to despise our own safety, which
of all other men will give heed to us?”</p>

<pb n="217" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_217.html" id="iii.XXXIII-Page_217" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p34">But none of these things did they either think or say,
neither did they require any account of His injunctions, but simply
yielded and obeyed. And this came not from their own virtue only, but
also of the wisdom of their Teacher. For see how to each of the fearful
things He annexed an encouragement; as in the case of such as received
them not, He said, “It shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city;”
so here again, when He had said, “Ye shall be brought before
governors and kings,” He added, “for my sake, for a
testimony to them, and the Gentiles.” And this is no small
consolation, that they are suffering these things both for Christ, and
for the Gentiles’ conviction. Thus God, though no one regard, is
found to be everywhere doing His own works. Now these things were a
comfort to them, not that they desired the punishment of other men, but
that they might have ground of confidence, as sure to have Him
everywhere present with them, who had both foretold and foreknown these
things; and because not as wicked men, and as pests, were they to
suffer all this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p35">And together with these, He adds another, and that no
small consolation for them, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p36">“But when they deliver you up, take no
thought<note n="1414" id="iii.XXXIII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p37">[R.V., “be not anxious.”]</p></note>how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that hour what
ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your
Father that speaketh in you.”<note n="1415" id="iii.XXXIII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 19, 20" id="iii.XXXIII-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|10|19|10|20" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.19-Matt.10.20">Matt. x.
19, 20</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p39">For lest they should say, “How shall we be able to
persuade men, when such things are taking place?” He bids them be
confident as to their defense also. And elsewhere indeed He saith,
“I will give you a mouth and wisdom;”<note n="1416" id="iii.XXXIII-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p40"><scripRef passage="Luke xxi. 15" id="iii.XXXIII-p40.1" parsed="|Luke|21|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.21.15">Luke xxi.
15</scripRef>.</p></note>but here, “It is the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in
you,” advancing them unto the dignity of the prophets. Therefore,
when He had spoken of the power that was given, then He added also the
terrors, the murders, and the slaughters.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p41">“For the brother shall deliver up the
brother,” saith He, “to death, and the father the child,
and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to
be put to death.”<note n="1417" id="iii.XXXIII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 21" id="iii.XXXIII-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|10|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.21">Matt. x.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p43">And not even at this did He stop, but added also what
was greatly more fearful, and enough to shiver a rock to pieces:
“And ye shall be hated of all men.” And here again the
consolation is at the doors, for, “For my name’s
sake,” saith He, “ye shall suffer these things.” And
with this again another, “But he that endureth to the end, the
same shall be saved.”<note n="1418" id="iii.XXXIII-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p44"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 22" id="iii.XXXIII-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|10|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.22">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p45">And these things in another point of view likewise were
sufficient to rouse up their spirits; since at any rate the power of
their gospel was to blaze up so high, as that nature should be
despised, and kindred rejected, and the Word preferred to all, chasing
all mightily away. For if no tyranny of nature is strong enough to
withstand your sayings, but it is dissolved and trodden under foot,
what else shall be able to get the better of you? Not, however, that
your life will be in security, because these things shall be; but
rather ye will have for your common enemies and foes them that dwell in
the whole world.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p46">5. Where now is Plato? Where Pythagoras? Where the long
chain<note n="1419" id="iii.XXXIII-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p47"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIII-p47.1">ὄρμαθο</span>.</p></note>of the Stoics? For the first, after having enjoyed great honor, was so
practically refuted, as even to be sold out of the country,<note n="1420" id="iii.XXXIII-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p48">For the story of Plato’s slavery, see Diogen.
Laertius, lib. 3; St. Chrys. in 1 Cor. Hom. IV. sec. 9; and Plutarch
(as there quoted) in his Life of Dion; as to its authenticity, see
Mitford’s Greece, iv. c. 31, sec. 8.</p></note>and to succeed in none of his objects, no, not go much as in respect of
one tyrant: yea, he betrayed his disciples, and ended his life
miserably. And the Cynics, mere pollutions as they were, have all
passed by like a dream and a shadow. And yet assuredly no such thing
ever befell them, but rather they were accounted glorious for their
heathen philosophy, and the Athenians made a public monument of the
epistles of Plato, sent them by Dion; and they passed all their time at
ease, and abounded in wealth not a little. Thus, for instance,
Aristippus was used to purchase costly harlots; and another made a
will, leaving no common inheritance; and another, when his disciples
had laid themselves down like a bridge, walked on them; and he of
Sinope, they say, even behaved himself unseemly in the market
place.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p49">Yea, these are their honorable things. But there is no
such thing here, but a strict temperance, and a perfect decency, and a
war against the whole world in behalf of truth and godliness, and to be
slain every day, and not until hereafter their glorious trophies.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p50">But there are some also, one may say, skilled in war
amongst them; as Themistocles, Pericles. But these things too are
children’s toys, compared with the acts of the fishermen. For
what canst thou say? That he persuaded the Athenians to embark in their
ships, when Xerxes was marching upon Greece? Why in this case, when it
is not Xerxes marching, but the devil with the whole world, and his
evil spirits innumerable

<pb n="218" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_218.html" id="iii.XXXIII-Page_218" />

assailing
these twelve men, not at one crisis only, but throughout their whole
life, they prevailed and vanquished; and what was truly marvellous, not
by slaying their adversaries, but by converting and reforming them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p51">For this especially you should observe throughout, that
they slew not, nor destroyed such as were plotting against them, but
having found them as bad as devils, they made them rivals of angels,
enfranchising human nature from this evil tyranny, while as to those
execrable demons that were confounding all things, they drave them out
of the midst of markets, and houses, or rather even from the very
wilderness. And to this the choirs of the monks bear witness, whom they
have planted everywhere, clearing out not the habitable only, but even
the uninhabitable land. And what is yet more marvellous, they did not
this in fair conflict, but in the enduring of evil they accomplished it
all. Since men actually had them in the midst, twelve unlearned
persons, binding, scourging, dragging them about, and were not able to
stop their mouths; but as it is impossible to bind the sunbeam, so also
their tongue. And the reason was, “it was not they”
themselves “that spake,” but the power of the Spirit. Thus
for instance did Paul overcome Agrippa, and Nero, who surpassed all men
in wickedness. “For the Lord,” saith he, “stood with
me, and strengthened me, and delivered me out of the mouth of the
lion.”<note n="1421" id="iii.XXXIII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p52"><scripRef passage="2 Tim. iv. 17" id="iii.XXXIII-p52.1" parsed="|2Tim|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.4.17">2 Tim. iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p53">But do thou also admire them, how when it was said to
them, “Take no thought,” they yet believed, and accepted
it, and none of the terrors amazed them. And if thou say, He gave them
encouragement enough, by saying, “It shall be the Spirit of your
Father that shall speak;” even for this am I most amazed at them,
that they doubted not, nor sought deliverance from their perils; and
this, when not for two or three years were they to suffer these things,
but all their life long. For the saying, “He that endureth to the
end, the same shall be saved,” is an intimation of this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p54">For His will is, that not His part only should be
contributed, but that the good deeds should be also done of them. Mark,
for instance, how from the first, part is His, part His
disciples’. Thus, to do miracles is His, but to provide nothing
is theirs. Again, to open all men’s houses, was of the grace from
above; but to require no more than was needful, of their own
self-denial. “For the workman is worthy of his hire.” Their
bestowing peace was of the gift of God, their inquiring for the worthy,
and not entering in without distinction unto all, of their own self
command. Again, to punish such as received them not was His, but to
retire with gentleness from them, without reviling or insulting them,
was of the apostles’ meekness. To give the Spirit, and cause them
not to take thought, was of Him that sent them, but to become like
sheep and doves, and to bear all things nobly, was of their calmness
and prudence. To be hated and not to despond, and to endure, was their
own; to save them that endured, was of Him who sent them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p55">Wherefore also He said, “He that endureth to the
end, the same shall be saved.” That is, because the more part are
wont at the beginning indeed to be vehement, but afterwards to faint,
therefore saith He, “I require the end.” For what is the
use of seeds, flourishing indeed at first, but a little after fading
away? Therefore it is continued patience that He requires of them. I
mean, lest any say, He wrought the whole Himself, and it was no wonder
that they should prove such, suffering as they did nothing intolerable;
therefore He saith unto them, “There is need also of patience on
your part. For though I should rescue you from the first dangers, I am
reserving you for others more grievous, and after these again others
will succeed; and ye shall not cease to have snares laid for you, so
long as ye have breath.” For this He intimated in saying,
“But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be
saved.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p56">For this cause then, though He said, “Take no
thought what ye shall speak;” yet elsewhere He saith, “Be
ready to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
hope that is in you.”<note n="1422" id="iii.XXXIII-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p57"><scripRef passage="1 Peter iii. 15" id="iii.XXXIII-p57.1" parsed="|1Pet|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Pet.3.15">1 Peter
iii. 15</scripRef>.</p></note> That is, as long as the contest is among friends, He commands us also
to take thought; but when there is a terrible tribunal, and frantic
assemblies, and terrors on all sides, He bestows the influence from
Himself, that they may take courage and speak out, and not be
discouraged, nor betray the righteous cause.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p58">For in truth it was a very great thing, for a man
occupied about lakes, and skins, and receipt of custom, when tyrants
were on their thrones, and satraps, and guards standing by them, and
the swords drawn, and all standing on their side; to enter in alone,
bound, hanging down his head, and yet be able to open his mouth. For
indeed they allowed them neither speech nor defense with respect to
their doctrines, but set about torturing them to death, as common pests
of the world.

<pb n="219" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_219.html" id="iii.XXXIII-Page_219" />

For
“They,” it is said, “that have turned the world
upside down, are come hither also;” and again, “They preach
things contrary to the decrees of Cæsar, saying that Jesus Christ
is king.”<note n="1423" id="iii.XXXIII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p59"><scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 6, 7" id="iii.XXXIII-p59.1" parsed="|Acts|17|6|17|7" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.6-Acts.17.7">Acts xvii.
6, 7</scripRef>.</p></note> And everywhere the courts of justice were preoccupied by such
suspicions, and much influence from above was needed, for their showing
both the truth of the doctrine they preached, and that they are not
violating the common laws; so that they should neither, while earnest
to speak of the doctrine, fall under suspicion of overturning the laws;
nor again, while earnest to show that they were not overturning the
common government, corrupt the perfection of their doctrines: all which
thou wilt see accomplished with all due consideration, both in Peter
and in Paul, and in all the rest. Yea, and as rebels and innovators,
and revolutionists, they were accused all over the world; yet
nevertheless they both repelled this impression, and invested
themselves with the contrary, all men celebrating them as saviors, and
guardians, and benefactors. And all this they achieved by their much
patience. Wherefore also Paul said, “I die daily;”<note n="1424" id="iii.XXXIII-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p60"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 31, 30" id="iii.XXXIII-p60.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|31|0|0;|1Cor|15|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.31 Bible:1Cor.15.30">1 Cor. xv.
31, 30</scripRef>.</p></note>and he continued to “stand in jeopardy” unto the end.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p61">6. What then must we deserve, having such high patterns,
and in peace giving way to effeminacy, and remissness? With none to
make war (it is too evident) we are slain; we faint when no man
pursues, in peace we are required to be saved, and even for this we are
not sufficient. And they indeed, when the world was on fire, and the
pile was being kindled over the whole earth, entering, snatched from
within, out of the midst of the flame, such as were burning; but thou
art not able so much as to preserve thyself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p62">What confidence then will there be for us? What favor?
There are no stripes, no prisons, no rulers, no synagogues, nor aught
else of that kind to set upon us; yea, quite on the contrary we rule
and prevail. For both kings are godly, and there are many honors for
Christians, and precedences, and distinctions, and immunities, and not
even so do we prevail. And whereas they being daily led to execution,
both teachers and disciples, and bearing innumerable stripes, and
continual brandings, were in greater luxury than such as abide in
Paradise; we who have endured no such thing, not even in a dream, are
softer than any wax. “But they,” it will be said,
“wrought miracles.” Did this then keep them from the
scourge? did it free them from persecution? Nay, for this is the
strange thing, that they suffered such things often even at the hands
of them whom they benefited, and not even so were they confounded,
receiving only evil for good. But thou if thou bestow on any one any
little benefit, and then be requited with anything unpleasant, art
confounded, art troubled, and repentest of that which thou hast
done.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p63">If now it should happen, as I pray it may not happen nor
at any time fall out, that there be a war against churches, and a
persecution, imagine how great will be the ridicule, how sore the
reproaches. And very naturally; for when no one exercises himself in
the wrestling school, how shall he be distinguished in the contests?
What champion, not being used to the trainer, will be able, when
summoned by the Olympic contests, to show forth anything great and
noble against his antagonist? Ought we not every day to wrestle and
fight and run? See ye not them that are called Pentathli, when they
have no antagonists, how they fill a sack with much sand, and hanging
it up try their full strength thereupon? And they that are still
younger, practise the fight against their enemies upon the persons of
their companions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p64">These do thou also emulate, and practise the wrestlings
of self denial. For indeed there are many that provoke to anger, and
incite to lust, and kindle a great flame. Stand therefore against thy
passions, bear nobly the mental pangs, that thou mayest endure also
those of the body.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p65">7. For so the blessed Job, if he had not exercised
himself well before his conflicts, would not have shone so brightly in
the same. Unless he had practised freedom from all despondency, he
would have uttered some rash word, when his children died. But as it
was he stood against all the assaults, against ruin of fortune, and
destruction of so great affluence: against loss of children, against
his wife’s commiseration, against plagues in body, against
reproaches of friends, against revilings of servants.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p66">And if thou wouldest see his ways of exercise also, hear
him saying, how he used to despise wealth: “If I did but
rejoice,” saith he, “because my wealth was great: if I set
gold up for a heap, if I put my trust in a precious stone.”<note n="1425" id="iii.XXXIII-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p67"><scripRef passage="Job xxxi. 25, 24" id="iii.XXXIII-p67.1" parsed="|Job|31|25|0|0;|Job|31|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.31.25 Bible:Job.31.24">Job xxxi.

desired them not when present.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p68">Hear how he also managed what related to his children,
not giving way to undue softness, as we do, but requiring of them all
circumspection. For he who offered sacrifice

<pb n="220" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_220.html" id="iii.XXXIII-Page_220" />

even for their secret sins, imagine how strict
a judge he was of such as were manifest.<note n="1426" id="iii.XXXIII-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p69"><scripRef passage="Job i. 5" id="iii.XXXIII-p69.1" parsed="|Job|1|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.1.5">Job i.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p70">And if thou wouldest also hear of his strivings after
continence, hearken to him when he saith, “I made a covenant with
mine eyes, that I should not think upon a maid.”<note n="1427" id="iii.XXXIII-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p71"><scripRef passage="Job xxxi. 1" id="iii.XXXIII-p71.1" parsed="|Job|31|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.31.1">Job xxxi.
1</scripRef>.</p></note> For this cause his wife did not break his spirit, for he loved her even
before this, not however immoderately, but as is due to a wife.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p72">Wherefore I am led even to marvel, whence it came into
the devil’s thought to stir up the contest, knowing as he did of
his previous training. Whence then did it occur to him? The monster is
wicked, and never despairs: and this turns out to us a very great
condemnation that he indeed never gives up the hope of our destruction,
but we despair of our own salvation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p73">But for bodily mutilation and indignity, mark how he
practised himself. Why, inasmuch as he himself had never undergone any
such thing, but had continued to live in wealth and luxury, and in all
other splendor, he used to divine other men’s calamities, one by
one. And this he declared, when he said, “For the thing which I
greatly feared is come upon me; and that which I was afraid of is come
unto me.”<note n="1428" id="iii.XXXIII-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p74"><scripRef passage="Job iii. 25" id="iii.XXXIII-p74.1" parsed="|Job|3|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.3.25">Job iii.

saw a man in distress.”<note n="1429" id="iii.XXXIII-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p75"><scripRef passage="Job xxx. 25" id="iii.XXXIII-p75.1" parsed="|Job|30|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.30.25">Job xxx.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p76">So because of this, nothing of what happened confounded
him, none of those great and intolerable ills. For I bid thee not look
at the ruin of his substance, nor at the loss of his children, nor at
that incurable plague, nor at his wife’s device against him; but
at those things which are far more grievous than these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p77">“And what,” saith one, “did Job suffer
more grievous than these? for from his history there is nothing more
than these for us to learn.” Because we are asleep, we do not
learn, since he surely that is anxious, and searches well for the
pearl, will know of many more particulars than these. For the more
grievous, and apt to infuse greater perplexity, were different.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p78">And first, his knowing nothing certain about the kingdom
of heaven, and the resurrection; which indeed he also spoke of,
lamenting. “For I shall not live alway, that I should suffer
long.”<note n="1430" id="iii.XXXIII-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p79"><scripRef passage="Job vii. 16" id="iii.XXXIII-p79.1" parsed="|Job|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.7.16">Job vii.
16</scripRef>, <span class="c20" id="iii.XXXIII-p79.2">LXX</span>.</p></note> Next, his being conscious to himself of many good works. Thirdly, his
being conscious of no evil thing. Fourthly, his supposing that at
God’s hands he was undergoing it; or if at the devil’s,
this again was enough to offend him. Fifthly, his hearing his friends
accusing him of wickedness, “For thou hast not been
scourged,” say they, “according to what thy sins
deserve.”<note n="1431" id="iii.XXXIII-p79.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p80"><scripRef passage="Job xi. 6" id="iii.XXXIII-p80.1" parsed="|Job|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.11.6">Job xi.
6</scripRef>.</p></note> Sixthly, his seeing such as lived in wickedness prospering, and
exulting over him. Seventhly, not having any other to whom he might
look as even having ever suffered such things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p81">8. And if thou wouldest learn how great these things
are, consider our present state. For if now, when we are looking for a
kingdom, and hoping for a resurrection, and for the unutterable
blessings, and are conscious to ourselves of countless evil deeds, and
when we have so many examples, and are partakers of so high a
philosophy; should any persons lose a little gold, and this often,
after having taken it by violence, they deem life not to be lived in,
having no wife to lay sore on them, nor bereaved of children, nor
reproached by friends, nor insulted by servants, but rather having many
to comfort them, some by words, some by deeds; of how noble crowns must
not he be worthy, who seeing what he had gotten together by honest
labor, snatched away from him for nought and at random, and after all
that, undergoing temptations without number, like sleet, yet throughout
all abides unmoved, and offers to the Lord his due thanksgiving for it
all?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p82">Why, though no one had spoken any of the other taunts,
yet his wife’s words alone were sufficient utterly to shake a
very rock. Look, for example, at her craft. No mention of money, none
of camels, and flocks, and herds, (for she was conscious of her
husband’s self command with regard to these), but of what was
harder to bear than all these, I mean, their children; and she deepens
the tragedy, and adds to it her own influence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p83">Now if when men were in wealth, and suffering no
distress, in many things and oft have women prevailed on them: imagine
how courageous was that soul, which repulsed her, assaulting him with
such powerful weapons, and which trod under foot the two most
tyrannical passions, desire and pity. And yet many having conquered
desire, have yielded to pity. That noble Joseph, for instance, held in
subjection the most tyrannical of pleasures, and repulsed that strange
woman, plying him as she did with innumerable devices; but his tears he
contained not, but when he saw his brethren that had wronged him, he
was all on fire with that passion, and quickly cast off the mask, and
discovered the part he had been playing.<note n="1432" id="iii.XXXIII-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p84"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIII-p84.1">δρμα</span>.</p></note> But when first of all she is his wife, and when her words are piteous,
and the moment favorable for her,

<pb n="221" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_221.html" id="iii.XXXIII-Page_221" />

as well as his wounds and his stripes, and those countless
waves of calamities; how can one otherwise than rightly pronounce the
soul impassive to so great a storm to be firmer than any adamant?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p85">Allow me freely to say, that the very apostles, if not
inferior to this blessed man, are at least not greater than he was. For
they indeed were comforted by the suffering for Christ; and this
medicine was so sufficient daily to relieve them, that the Lord puts it
everywhere, saying, “for me, for my sake,” and, “If
they call me, the master of the house, Beelzebub.”<note n="1433" id="iii.XXXIII-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p86"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 25" id="iii.XXXIII-p86.1" parsed="|Matt|10|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.25">Matt. x.
25</scripRef>.</p></note> But he was destitute of this encouragement, and of that from miracles,
and of that from grace; for neither had he so great power of the
Spirit.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p87">And what is yet greater, nourished in much delicacy, not
from amongst fishermen, and publicans, and such as lived frugally, but
after enjoyment of so much honor, he suffered all that he did suffer.
And what seemed hardest to bear in the case of the apostles, this same
he also underwent, being hated of friends, of servants, of enemies, of
them who had received kindness of him: and the sacred anchor, the
harbor without waves, namely, that which was said to the apostles,
“for my sake,” of this he had no sight.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p88">I admire again the three children, for that they dared
the furnace, that they stood up against a tyrant. But hear what they
say, “We serve not thy Gods, nor worship the image which thou
hast set up.”<note n="1434" id="iii.XXXIII-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p89"><scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 18" id="iii.XXXIII-p89.1" parsed="|Dan|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.18">Dan. iii.

certainty that for God they are suffering all whatsoever they suffer.
But this man knew not that it was all conflicts, and a wrestling; for
had he known it, he would not have felt what was happening. At any
rate, when he heard, “Thinkest thou that I have uttered to thee
mine oracles for nought, or that thou mightest be proved
righteous?”<note n="1435" id="iii.XXXIII-p89.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p90"><scripRef passage="Job xl. 3" id="iii.XXXIII-p90.1" parsed="|Job|40|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.40.3">Job xl.

made himself of no account, how he accounted himself not so much as to
have suffered what he had suffered, thus saying, “Why do I plead
any more, being admonished and reproved of the Lord, hearing such
things, I being nothing?”<note n="1436" id="iii.XXXIII-p90.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIII-p91"><scripRef passage="Job xl. 4" id="iii.XXXIII-p91.1" parsed="|Job|40|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.40.4">Job xl.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIII-p93">This fortitude then, this moderation, of him that was
before law and grace, let us also emulate, who are after law and grace;
that we may also be able to share with him the eternal tabernacles;
unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the victory forever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XXXIV-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXXIV-p4.1">Having</span> spoken of those fearful
and horrible things, enough to melt very adamant, which after His
cross, and resurrection, and assumption, were to befall them, He
directs again His discourse to what was of more tranquil character,
allowing those whom He is training to recover breath, and affording
them full security. For He did not at all command them, when
persecuted, to close with the enemy, but to fly. That is, it being so
far but a beginning, and a prelude, He gave His discourse a very
condescending turn. For not now of the ensuing persecutions is He
speaking, but of those before the cross and the passion. And this He
showed by saying, “Ye shall not have gone over the cities of
Israel, till the Son of Man be come.” That is, lest they should
say, “What then, if when persecuted we flee, and there again they
overtake us, and drive us out?”—to destroy this fear, He
saith, “Ye shall not have gone round Palestine first, but I will
straightway come upon you.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p5">And see how here again He doeth not

away with the terrors, but stands by them in
their perils. For He said not, “I will snatch you out, and will
put an end to the persecutions;” but what? “Ye shall not
have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be
come.” Yea, for it sufficed for their consolation, simply to see
Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p6">But do thou observe, I pray thee, how He doth not on
every occasion leave all to grace, but requires something also to be
contributed on their part. “For if ye fear,” saith He,
“flee,” for this He signified by saying, “flee
ye,” and “fear not.”<note n="1438" id="iii.XXXIV-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p7"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 26" id="iii.XXXIV-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|10|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.26">Matt. x.

withdraw; neither is it a great distance that He allows them, but so
much as to go about the cities of Israel.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p8">Then again, He trains them for another branch of
self-command; first, casting out all care for their food: secondly, all
fear of their perils; and now, that of calumny. Since from that first
anxiety He freed them, by saying, “The workman is worthy of his
hire,”<note n="1439" id="iii.XXXIV-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p9"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 10" id="iii.XXXIV-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.10">Matt. x.

about their dangers, by saying, “Take no thought how or what ye

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p11">But since withal it was likely that they should also
bring upon themselves an evil report, which to many seems harder to
bear than all; see whence He comforts them even in this case, deriving
the encouragement from Himself, and from all that had been said
touching Himself; to which nothing else was equal. For as He said in
that other place, “Ye shall be hated of all men,” and
added, “for my name’s sake,” so also here.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p12">And in another way He mitigates it, joining a fresh
topic to that former. What kind of one then is it?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p13">“The disciple,” saith He, “is not

disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord. If they
have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they
call them of His household? Fear them not therefore.”<note n="1441" id="iii.XXXIV-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 24-26" id="iii.XXXIV-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|10|24|10|26" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.24-Matt.10.26">Matt. x.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p15">See how He discovers Himself to be the Lord and God and

that honor. For tell me not here of the rare instances, but take the
principle from the majority. And He saith not, “How much more His

very near He felt them to be to Him.<note n="1443" id="iii.XXXIV-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p17"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIV-p17.1">γνησιτητα

calumniated Him; but states also the very form of the insult, that they
“called Him Beelzebub.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p19">Then He gives also another consolation, not inferior to
this: for this indeed is the greatest; but because for them who were
not yet living strictly, there was need also of another, such as might
have special power to refresh them, He states it likewise. And the
saying seems indeed in form to be an universal proposition,
nevertheless not of all matters, but of those in hand only, is it
spoken. For what saith He?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p20">“There is nothing covered, that shall not be
revealed; nor hid, that shall not be known.”<note n="1445" id="iii.XXXIV-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 16" id="iii.XXXIV-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|10|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.16">Matt. x.

encouragement, that I also shared with you in the same reproach; I who
am your Master and Lord. But if it still grieve you to hear these
words, consider this other thing too, that even from this suspicion ye
will soon be released. For why do ye grieve? At their calling you
sorcerers and deceivers? But wait a little, and all men will address
you as saviors, and benefactors of the world. Yea, for time discovers
all things that are concealed, it will both refute their false
accusation, and make manifest your virtue. For when the event shows you
saviors, and benefactors, and examples of all virtue, men will not give
heed to their words, but to the real state of the case; and they will
appear false accusers, and liars, and slanderers, but ye brighter than
the sun, length of time revealing and proclaiming you, and uttering a
voice clearer than a trumpet, and making all men witnesses of your
virtue. Let not therefore what is now said humble you, but let the hope
of the good things to come raise you up. For it cannot be, that what
relates to you should be hid.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p22">2. Then, having rid them of all distress, and fears, and
anxiety, and set them above men’s reproaches, then, and not till
then, He seasonably discourses to them also of boldness in their
preaching.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p23">For, “What I tell you,” saith He, “in
darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye have heard in the ear,
that preach ye<note n="1446" id="iii.XXXIV-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p24">[R.V., “proclaim.”]</p></note>upon the housetops.”<note n="1447" id="iii.XXXIV-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p25"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 27" id="iii.XXXIV-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|10|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.27">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p26">Yet it was not at all darkness, when He was saying these
things; neither was He dis

coursing
unto them in the ear; but He used a strong figure, thus speaking. That
is, because He was conversing with them alone, and in a small corner of
Palestine, therefore He said, “in darkness,” and “in
the ear;” contrasting the boldness of speech, which He was
hereafter to confer on them, with the tone of the conversation which
was then going on. “For not to one, or two, or three cities, but
to the whole world ye shall preach,” saith He, “traversing
land and sea, the inhabited country, and the desert; to princes alike
and tribes, to philosophers and orators, saying all with open
face,<note n="1448" id="iii.XXXIV-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p27"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIV-p27.1">γυμν τ

the house tops,” and, “In the light,” without any
shrinking, and with all freedom.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p28">And wherefore said He not only, “Preach on the
housetops,” and “Speak in the light,” but added also,
“What I tell you in darkness,” and “What ye hear in
the ear”? It was to raise up their spirits. As therefore when He
said, “He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do
also, and greater works than these shall he do;”<note n="1449" id="iii.XXXIV-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p29"><scripRef passage="John xiv. 12" id="iii.XXXIV-p29.1" parsed="|John|14|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.12">John xiv.
12</scripRef>.</p></note>even so here too, to signify that He will do it all by them, and more
than by Himself, He inserted this. For “the beginning
indeed,” saith He, “I have given, and the prelude; but the
greater part it is my will to effect through you.” Now this is
the language of one not commanding only, but also declaring beforehand
what was to be, and encouraging them with His sayings, and implying
that they should prevail over all, and quietly also removing<note n="1450" id="iii.XXXIV-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p30"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIV-p30.1">υπορττοντο</span>.</p></note>again their distress at the evil report. For as this doctrine, after
lying hid for a while, shall overspread all things, so also the evil
suspicion of the Jews shall quickly perish.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p31">Then, because He had lifted them up on high, He again
gives warning of the perils also, adding wings to their mind, and
exalting them high above all. For what saith He? “Fear not them
which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.”<note n="1451" id="iii.XXXIV-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 28" id="iii.XXXIV-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|10|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.28">Matt. x.
28</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou how He set them far above all things, persuading them to
despise not anxiety only and calumny, dangers and plots, but even that
which is esteemed of all things most terrible, death? And not death
alone, but by violence too? And He said not, “ye shall be
slain,” but with the dignity that became Him, He set this before
them, saying, “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not
able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him<note n="1452" id="iii.XXXIV-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p33">[Chrysostom plainly refers this to God, not Satan.
Hence the capital letter of the Oxford translator.—R.]</p></note>which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell;” bringing
round the argument, as He ever doth, to its opposite. For what? is your
fear, saith He, of death? and are ye therefore slow to preach? Nay for
this very cause I bid you preach, that ye fear death: for this shall
deliver you from that which is really death. What though they shall
slay you? yet over the better part they shall not prevail, though they
strive ten thousand ways. Therefore He said not, “Who do not kill
the soul,” but, who “are not able to kill.” For wish
it as they may, they shall not prevail. Wherefore, if thou fear
punishment, fear that, the more grievous by far.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p34">Seest thou how again He doth not promise them
deliverance from death, but permits them to die, granting them more
than if He had not allowed them to suffer it? Because deliverance from
death is not near so great as persuading men to despise death. You see
now, He doth not push them into dangers, but sets them above dangers,
and in a short sentence fixes in their mind the doctrines that relate
to the immortality of the soul, and having in two or three words
implanted a saving doctrine, He comforts them also by other
considerations.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p35">Thus, lest they should think, when killed and butchered,
that as men forsaken they suffered this, He introduces again the
argument of God’s providence, saying on this wise: “Are not
two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall into a
snare<note n="1453" id="iii.XXXIV-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p36">See received text above, Hom. IX. 4. [The reading

29, 30</scripRef>.</p></note>“For what is viler than they?” saith He;
“nevertheless, not even these shall be taken without God’s
knowledge.” For He means not this, “by His operation they
fall,” for this were unworthy of God; but, “nothing that is
done is hid from Him.” If then He is not ignorant of anything
that befalls us, and loves us more truly than a father, and so loves
us, as to have numbered our very hairs; we ought not to be afraid. And
this He said, not that God numbers our hairs, but that He might
indicate His perfect knowledge, and His great providence over them. If
therefore He both knows all the things that are done, and is able to
save you, and willing; whatever ye may have to suffer, think not that
as persons forsaken ye suffer. For neither is it His will to deliver
you from the terrors, but to persuade you to despise them, since this
is, more than anything, deliverance from the terrors.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p38">3. “Fear ye not therefore; ye are of more value
than many sparrows.”<note n="1455" id="iii.XXXIV-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 31" id="iii.XXXIV-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|10|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.31">Matt. x.
31</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou that the fear had already prevailed over them? Yea, for He
knew the secrets of the heart; therefore He added, “Fear them not
therefore;” for even should they prevail, it will be over the
inferior part, I mean, the body; which though they should not kill,
nature will surely take with her and depart. So that not even this
depends on them, but men have it from nature. And if thou fear this,
much more shouldest thou fear what is greater, and dread “Him who
is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” And He saith not
openly now, that it is Himself, “Who is able to destroy both soul
and body,” but where He before declared Himself to be judge, He
made it manifest.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p40">But now the contrary takes place: Him, namely, who is
able to destroy the soul, that is, to punish it, we fear not, but those
who slay the body, we shudder at. Yet surely while He together with the
soul punishes the body also, they cannot even chasten the body, much
less the soul: and though they chasten it ever so severely, yet in that
way they rather make it more glorious.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p41">Seest thou how He signifies the conflicts to be easy?
Because in truth, death did exceedingly agitate their souls, inspiring
terror for a time, for that it had not as yet been made easy to
overcome, neither had they that were to despise it partaken of the
grace of the Spirit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p42">Having, you see, cast out the fear and distress that was
agitating their soul; by what follows He also encourages them again,
casting out fear by fear; and not by fear only, but also by the hope of
great prizes; and He threatens with much authority, in both ways urging
them to speak boldly for the truth; and saith further,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p43">“Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men,
him<note n="1456" id="iii.XXXIV-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p44">[R.V., “Every one, therefore, shall confess me

shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which
is in Heaven.”<note n="1457" id="iii.XXXIV-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 32, 33" id="iii.XXXIV-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|10|32|10|33" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.32-Matt.10.33">Matt. x.
32, 33</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p46">Thus not from the good things only, but also from the
opposites, doth He urge them; and He concludes with the dismal
part.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p47">And mark His exact care; He said not “me,”
but “in me,” implying that not by a power of his own, but
by the help of grace from above, the confessor makes his confession.
But of him that denies, He said not, “in me,” but
“me;” for he having become destitute of the gift, his
denial ensues.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p48">“Why then is he blamed,” one may say,
“if being forsaken, he denies?” Because the being forsaken
is the fault of the forsaken person himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p49">But why is He not satisfied with the faith in the mind,
but requires also the confession with the mouth? To train us up to
boldness in speech, and a more abundant love and determination, and to
raise us on high. Wherefore also He addresses Himself to all. Nor doth
He at all apply this to the disciples only in person, for not them, but
their disciples too, He is now rendering noble hearted. Because he that
hath learnt this lesson will not only teach with boldness, but will
likewise suffer all things easily, and with ready mind. This at any
rate brought over many to the apostles, even their belief in this word.
Because both in the punishment the infliction is heavier, and in the
good things the recompense greater. I mean, whereas he that doeth right
hath the advantage in time,<note n="1458" id="iii.XXXIV-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIV-p50.1">τ χρν
πλεονεκτε</span>,
“he is beforehand with his rewarder:” his sufferings, and
the sinner’s enjoyment, come respectively first.</p></note>and the delay of the penalty is counted for gain by the sinner: He hath
introduced an equivalent, or rather a much greater advantage, the
increase of the recompenses. “Hast thou the advantage,”
saith He, “by having first confessed me here? I also will have
the advantage of thee, by giving thee greater things, and unspeakably
greater; for I will confess thee there.” Seest thou that both the
good things and the evil things are there to be dispensed? Why then
hasten and hurry thyself? and why seek thy rewards here, thou who art
“saved by hope?”<note n="1459" id="iii.XXXIV-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p51"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 24" id="iii.XXXIV-p51.1" parsed="|Rom|8|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.24">Rom. viii.
24</scripRef>. [“Saved in
hope” or “for hope” expresses better, and agrees with
the argument in the Homily.—R.]</p></note> Wherefore, whether thou hast done anything good, and not received its
recompense here, be not troubled (for with increase, in the time to
come, the reward thereof awaits thee): or whether thou hast done any
evil, and not paid the penalty, be not easy; for there will vengeance
receive thee, if thou turn not and amend.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p52">But if thou believe it not, from the things here form
thy conjecture about things to come also. Why, if in the season of the
conflicts they that confess are so glorious, imagine what they will be
in the season of the crowns. If the enemies here applaud, how shall
that tenderest of all fathers fail to admire and proclaim thee? Yea,
then shall we have both our gifts for the good, and our punishments for
the evil. So that such as deny shall suffer harm, both here and there;

<pb n="225" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_225.html" id="iii.XXXIV-Page_225" />

here living with an evil
conscience, though they were never to die, they shall be surely dead;
and there, undergoing the last penalty: but the other sort will profit
both here and there, both here making a gain of their death, and in
this way becoming more glorious than the living, and there enjoying
those unspeakable blessings.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p53">God then is in no wise prompt to punish only, but also
to confer benefits; and for this last more than for the first. But why
hath He put the reward once only, the punishment twice? He knows that
this would be more apt to correct us. For this cause when He had said,
“Fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell,” He saith again, “Him will I also deny.” So
doth Paul also, continually making mention of hell.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p54">Thus we see that He, having by all ways trained on His
scholar (both by opening Heaven to him, and by setting before him that
fearful judgment-seat, and by pointing to the amphitheatre of angels,
and how in the midst of them the crowns shall be proclaimed, which
thing would thenceforth prepare the way for the word of godliness to be
very easily received); in what follows, lest they grow timid and the
word be hindered, He bids them be prepared even for slaughter itself;
to make them aware that such as continue in their error, will have to
suffer (among other things) for plotting against them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p55">4. Let us therefore despise death, although the time be
not come that requires it of us; for indeed it will translate us to a
far better life. “But the body decays.” Why, on this
account most especially we ought to rejoice, because death decays, and
mortality perishes, not the substance of the body. For neither,
shouldest thou see a statue being cast, wouldest thou call the process
destruction, but an improved formation. Just so do thou reason also
concerning the body, and do not bewail. Then it were right to bewail,
had it remained in its chastisement.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p56">“But,” saith one, “this ought to take
place without the decay of our bodies; they should continue
entire.” And what would this have advantaged either the living or
the departed? How long are ye lovers of the body? How long are ye
rivetted to the earth and gaping after shadows? Why, what good would
this have done? or rather, what harm would it not have done? For did
our bodies not decay, in the first place the greatest of all evils,
pride, would have continued with many. For if even while this is going
on, and worms gushing out, many have earnestly sought to be gods; what
would not have been the result did the body continue?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p57">In the second place, it would not be believed to be of
earth; for if, its end witnessing this, some yet doubt; what would they
not have suspected if they did not see this? Thirdly, the bodies would
have been excessively loved; and most men would have become more carnal
and gross; and if even now some cleave to men’s tombs and
coffins, after that themselves have perished, what would they not have
done, if they had even their image preserved? Fourthly, they would not
have earnestly desired the things to come. Fifthly, they that say the
world is eternal, would have been more confirmed, and would have denied
God as Creator. Sixthly, they would not have known the excellence of
the soul, and how great a thing is the presence of a soul in a body.
Seventhly, many of them that lose their relations would have left their
cities, and have dwelt in the tombs, and have become frantic,
conversing continually with their own dead. For if even now men form to
themselves images, since they cannot keep the body (for neither is it
possible, but whether they will or no it glides and hurries from them),
and are rivetted to the planks of wood; what monstrous thing would they
not then have devised? To my thinking, the generality would have even
built temples for such bodies, and they that are skilled in such
sorceries would have persuaded evil spirits to speak through them;
since at least even now, they that venture on the arts of necromancy
attempt many things more out of the way than these. And how many
idolatries would not have arisen from hence? when men even after the
dust and ashes, are yet eager in those practices.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p58">God therefore, to take away all our extravagances, and
to teach us to stand off from all earthly things, destroys the bodies
before our eyes. For even he that is enamored of bodies, and is greatly
affected at the sight of a beautiful damsel, if he will not learn by
discourse the deformity of that substance, shall know it by the very
sight. Yea, many of the like age with her whom he loves, and oftentimes
also fairer, being dead, after the first or second day, have emitted an
ill savor, and foul matter, and decay with worms. Imagine then what
sort of beauty thou lovest, and what sort of elegance has power so to
disturb thee. But if bodies did not decay, this would not be well
known: but as evil spirits run unto men’s graves, so also many of
our lovers, continually sitting by the tombs, would have received evil
spirits in their soul, and would quickly have perished in this grievous
madness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p59">But as it is, together with all other things

<pb n="226" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_226.html" id="iii.XXXIV-Page_226" />

this also comforts the soul, that the
form is not seen: it brings men to forgetfulness of their affliction.
Indeed, if this were not so, there would be no tombs at all, but thou
wouldest see our cities having corpses instead of statues, each man
desiring to look upon his own dead. And much confusion would arise
hence, and none of the ordinary sort would attend to his soul, nor
would give room to the doctrine of immortality to enter in: and many
other things too, more shocking than these, would have resulted, which
even to speak of were unseemly. Wherefore it decays presently, that
thou mightest see unveiled the beauty of the soul. For if she be the
procurer of all that beauty and life, much more excellent must she
herself be. And if she preserve that which is so deformed and
unsightly, much more herself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p60">5. For it is not the body wherein the beauty lies, but
the expression,<note n="1460" id="iii.XXXIV-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIV-p61"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXIV-p61.1">διπλασι</span>, “the
moulding of it by the informing soul.”</p></note>and the bloom which is shed over its substance by the soul. Now then, I
bid thee love that which makes the body also to appear such as it is.
And why speak I of death? Nay even in life itself, I would have thee
mark how all is hers that is beautiful. For whether she be pleased, she
showers roses over the cheeks; or whether she be pained, she takes that
beauty, and involves it all in a dark robe. And if she be continually
in mirth, the body improves in condition; if in grief, she renders the
same thinner and weaker than a spider’s web; if in wrath, she
hath made it again abominable and foul; if she show the eye calm, great
is the beauty that she bestows; if she express envy, very pale and
livid is the hue she sheds over us; if love, abundant the gracefulness
she at once confers. Thus in fact many women, not being beautiful in
feature, have derived much grace from the soul; others again of
brilliant bloom, by having an ungracious soul, have marred their
beauty. Consider how a face that is pale grows red, and by the
variation of color produces great delight, when there is need of shame
and blushing. As, on the other hand, if it be shameless, it makes the
countenance more unpleasing than any monster.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p62">For nothing is fairer, nothing sweeter than a beauteous
soul. For while as to bodies, the longing is with pain, in the case of
souls the pleasure is pure and calm. Why then let go the king, and be
wild about the herald? Why leave the philosopher, and gape after his
interpreter? Hast thou seen a beautiful eye? acquaint thyself with that
which is within; and if that be not beautiful, despise this likewise.
For surely, didst thou see an ill-favored woman wearing a beautiful
mask, she would make no impression on thee: just as on the other hand,
neither wouldest thou suffer one fair and beautiful to be disguised by
the mask, but wouldest take it away, as choosing to see her beauty
unveiled.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIV-p63">This then I bid thee do in regard of the soul also, and

Because this more than anything is peace, when the diseased is cut off,
when the mutinous is removed. For thus it is possible for Heaven to be
united to earth. Since the physician too in this way preserves the rest
of the body, when he amputates the incurable part; and the general,
when he has brought to a separation them that were agreed in mischief.
Thus it came to pass also in the case of that famous tower; for their
evil peace<note n="1465" id="iii.XXXV-p8.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p9"><scripRef passage="Gen. xi. 7, 8" id="iii.XXXV-p9.1" parsed="|Gen|11|7|11|8" osisRef="Bible:Gen.11.7-Gen.11.8">Gen. xi. 7,

divided them that were conspiring against him.<note n="1466" id="iii.XXXV-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p10"><scripRef passage="Acts xxiii. 6, 7" id="iii.XXXV-p10.1" parsed="|Acts|23|6|23|7" osisRef="Bible:Acts.23.6-Acts.23.7">Acts xxiii.

together.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p12">The war is not then the effect of His purpose, but of
their temper. For His will indeed was that all should agree in the word
of godliness; but because they fell to dissension, war arises. Yet He
spake not so; but what saith He? “I am not come to send
peace;” comforting them. As if He said, For think not that ye are
to blame for these things; it is I who order them so, because men are
so disposed. Be not ye therefore confounded, as though the events
happened against expectation. To this end am I come, to send war among
men; for this is my will. Be not ye therefore troubled, when the earth
is at war, as though it were subject to some hostile device. For when
the worse part is rent away, then after that Heaven is knit unto the
better.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p13">And these things He saith, as strengthening them against
the evil suspicion of the multitude.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p14">And He said not “war,” but what was more
grievous than it, “a sword.” And if there be somewhat
painful in these expressions, and of an alarming emphasis, marvel not.
For, it being His will to train their ears by the severity of His
words, lest in their difficult circumstances they should start aside,
He fashioned His discourse accordingly; lest any one should say it was
by flattery He persuaded them, and by concealing the hardships;
therefore even to those things which merited to be otherwise expressed,
He gave by His words the more galling and painful turn. For it is
better to see persons’ gentleness in things, than in words.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p15">2. Wherefore neither with this was He satisfied, but
unfolds also the very nature of the war, signifying it to be far more
grievous even than a civil war; and He saith, “I am come to set a
man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her
mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”<note n="1468" id="iii.XXXV-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 35" id="iii.XXXV-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|10|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.35">Matt. x.
35</scripRef>. [R.V., “I
came,” etc.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p17">For not friends only, saith He, nor fellow citizens, but
even kinsmen shall stand against one another, and nature shall be
divided against herself. “For I am come,” saith He,
“to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter
against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law.” That is, not merely among those of the same
household is the war, but among those that are dearest, and extremely
near to each other. And this more than anything signifies His power,
that hearing these things, they both accepted Him, and set about
persuading all others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p18">Yet was it not He that did this: of course not: but the
wickedness of the other sort: nevertheless He saith it is His own
doing. For such is the custom of the Scripture. Yea, and elsewhere also
He saith, “God hath given them eyes that they should not
see:”<note n="1469" id="iii.XXXV-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p19"><scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 8" id="iii.XXXV-p19.1" parsed="|Rom|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.8">Rom. xi.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>and here He speaks in this way, in order that having, as I said before,
exercised themselves in these words, they might not be confounded on
suffering reproaches and insults.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p20">But if any think these things intolerable, let them be
reminded of an ancient history. For in times of old also this came to
pass, which thing especially shows the old covenant to be akin to the
new, and Him who is here speaking, the same with the giver of those
commands. I mean that in the case of the Jews also, when each had slain
his neighbor, then He laid aside His anger against them; both when they
made the calf, and when they were joined to Baal Peor.<note n="1470" id="iii.XXXV-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p21"><scripRef passage="Exod. xxxii. 29; Numb. xxv. 7-11" id="iii.XXXV-p21.1" parsed="|Exod|32|29|0|0;|Num|25|7|25|11" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.29 Bible:Num.25.7-Num.25.11">Exod.

good?” For behold He hath filled the world with blood, shed by
kinsmen. Nevertheless even this we affirm to be a work of great love
towards man.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p22">Therefore, you see, implying that it was He who approved
those other acts also, He makes mention also of a prophecy, which if
not spoken for this end, yet involves the same meaning. And what is
this?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p23">“A man’s foes shall be they of his own
household.”<note n="1471" id="iii.XXXV-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 36" id="iii.XXXV-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|10|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.36">Matt. x.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p25">For indeed among the Jews also something of the kind
took place. That is, there were prophets, and false prophets, and the
people was divided, and families were in dissension; and some believed
the one, and some the other. Wherefore the prophet admonishes, saying,
“Trust ye not in friends, have not hope in guides; yea, even of
her that lieth in thy bosom beware, in respect of communicating aught
to her:” and, “A man’s enemies are the men that are
in his own house.”<note n="1472" id="iii.XXXV-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p26"><scripRef passage="Micah vii. 5, 6" id="iii.XXXV-p26.1" parsed="|Mic|7|5|7|6" osisRef="Bible:Mic.7.5-Mic.7.6">Micah vii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p27">And this He said, preparing him that should receive the
word to be above all. For to die is not evil, but to die an evil death.
On this account He said moreover, “I am come to cast fire upon
the earth.”<note n="1473" id="iii.XXXV-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p28"><scripRef passage="Luke xii. 49" id="iii.XXXV-p28.1" parsed="|Luke|12|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.49">Luke xii.
49</scripRef>.</p></note> And this He said, to declare the vehemence and warmth of the love which
He required. For, because He loved us very much, so He will likewise be
loved of us. And these sayings would strengthen<note n="1474" id="iii.XXXV-p28.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p29"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXV-p29.1">ἤλειφε</span>, “would anoint them
for action.”</p></note>the persons present also, and lift them higher. “For if those
others,” saith He, “are to despise kinsmen, and children,
and parents, imagine what manner of men ye their teachers ought to be.
Since neither will the hardships stop with you, but will also pass on
to the rest. For since I am come bringing great blessings, I demand
also great obedience, and purpose of heart.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p30">3. “He that loveth father or mother more than me,
is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me,
is not worthy of me; and he that taketh not his cross and followeth
after me, is not worthy of me.”<note n="1475" id="iii.XXXV-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 37, 38" id="iii.XXXV-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|10|37|10|38" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.37-Matt.10.38">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p32">Seest thou a teacher’s dignity? Seest thou, how He
signifies himself a true Son of Him that begat Him, commanding us to
let go all things beneath, and to take in preference the love of
Him?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p33">“And why speak I,” saith He, “of
friends and kinsmen? Even if it be thine own life which thou preferrest
to my love, thy place is far from my disciples.” What then? Are
not these things contrary to the Old Testament? Far from it, rather
they are very much in harmony therewith. For there too He commands not
only to hate the worshippers of idols, but even to stone them; and in
Deuteronomy again, admiring these, He saith, “Who said unto his
father, and to his mother, I have not seen thee; neither did he
acknowledge his brethren, and his own sons he disowned: he kept Thy
oracles.”<note n="1476" id="iii.XXXV-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p34"><scripRef passage="Deut. xxxiii. 9" id="iii.XXXV-p34.1" parsed="|Deut|33|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.33.9">Deut.

obey them in all things, marvel not; for in those things only doth he
mean us to obey, as many as do not hinder godliness.<note n="1477" id="iii.XXXV-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p35"><scripRef passage="Eph. vi. 1" id="iii.XXXV-p35.1" parsed="|Eph|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.1">Eph. vi.
1</scripRef>. See there St.
Chrysostom’s explanation of the expression, “in the
Lord.”</p></note> For indeed it is a sacred duty to render them all other honors: but
when they demand more than is due, one ought not to obey. For this
reason Luke saith, “If any man come to me, and hate not his
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,
yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple;”<note n="1478" id="iii.XXXV-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p36"><scripRef passage="Luke xiv. 26" id="iii.XXXV-p36.1" parsed="|Luke|14|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.14.26">Luke xiv.
26</scripRef>.</p></note>not commanding simply to hate them, since this were even quite contrary
to the law; but “when one desires to be loved more than I am,
hate him in this respect. For this ruins both the beloved himself, and
the lover.” And these things He said, both to render the children
more determined, and to make the fathers more gentle, that would hinder
them. For when they saw He had such strength and power as to sever
their children from them, they, as attempting things impossible, would
even desist. Wherefore also He leaves the fathers, and addresses His
discourse to the children, instructing the former not to make the
attempt, as attempting things impracticable.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p37">Then lest they should be indignant, or count it hard,
see which way He makes His argument tend: in that having said,
“Who hateth not father and mother,” He adds, “and his
own life.” For why dost thou speak to me of parents, saith He,
and brothers, and sisters, and wife? Nothing is nearer than the life to
any man: yet if thou hate not this also, thou must bear in all things
the opposite of his lot who loveth me.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p38">And not even simply to hate it was His command, but so
as to expose it to war, and to battles, and to slaughters, and blood.
“For he that beareth not his cross, and cometh after me, cannot
be my disciple.”<note n="1479" id="iii.XXXV-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. 10.38; Luke 14.27" id="iii.XXXV-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|10|38|0|0;|Luke|14|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.38 Bible:Luke.14.27">Matt. x. 38. Comp. Luke xiv. 27</scripRef>. [The word “beareth” (from
Luke) is here substituted for “taketh.”—R.]</p></note> Thus He said not merely that we must stand against death, but also
against a violent death; and not violent only, but ignominious too.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p40">And He discourses nothing as yet of His own passion,
that when they had been for a time instructed in these things, they
might more easily receive His word concerning it. Is there not,
therefore, cause for amazement, how on their hearing these things,
their soul did not wing its way from the body, the hardships being
everywhere at hand, and the good things in expectation? How then did it
not flee away? Great was both the power of the speaker, and the love of
the hearers. Wherefore though hearing things far more intolera

ble and galling than those great men,
Moses and Jeremiah, they continued to obey, and to say nothing against
it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p41">“He that findeth his life,” saith He,
“shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall
find it.”<note n="1480" id="iii.XXXV-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 39" id="iii.XXXV-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|10|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.39">Matt. x.

the gain to them that hate it? I mean, because the injunctions were
disagreeable, when He was bidding them set themselves against parents,
and children, and nature, and kindred, and the world, and their very
soul, He sets forth the profit also, being very great. Thus,
“These things,” saith He, “so far from harming, will
very greatly profit; and their opposites will injure;” urging
them, as He ever doth, by the very things which they desire. For why
art thou willing to despise thy life?<note n="1481" id="iii.XXXV-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p43">Or “soul;” the same word standing in the
Greek for both “soul” and “life;” which makes
it impossible to give the full force of the passage in English.</p></note> Because thou lovest it? Then for that very reason despise it, and so
thou wilt advantage it in the highest degree, and do the part of one
that loves it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p44">And mark an instance of unspeakable consideration. For
not in respect of our parents only doth He practise this reasoning, nor
of our children, but with regard to our life, which is nearer than all;
that the other point may thenceforth become unquestionable, and they
may learn that they will in this way profit those of their kindred
likewise, as much as may be; since so it is in the case even of our
life, which is more essential to us than all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p45">4. Now these things were enough to recommend men to
receive them, their appointed healers. Yea, who would choose but
receive with all readiness them that were so noble, such true heroes,
and as lions running about the earth, and despising all that pertained
to themselves, so that others might be saved? Yet nevertheless He
proffers also another reward, indicating that He is caring here for the
entertainers more than for the guests.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p46">And the first honor He confers is by saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p47">“He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that
receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.”<note n="1482" id="iii.XXXV-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p48"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 40" id="iii.XXXV-p48.1" parsed="|Matt|10|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.40">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p49">With this, what may compare? that one should receive the
Father and the Son! But He holds out herewith another reward also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p50">“ He,” saith He, “that receiveth a
prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s
reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a
righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s
reward.”<note n="1483" id="iii.XXXV-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 41" id="iii.XXXV-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|10|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.41">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p52">And as before He threatens punishment to such as do not
receive them, here He defines also a certain refreshment<note n="1484" id="iii.XXXV-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p53"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXV-p53.1">ἄνεσιν</span>, opposed to <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXV-p53.2">κλασιν</span>,
“punishment,” in the same way, Hom. XIII. 8, in the
Benedictine edition, p. 176, c.; and elsewhere.</p></note>for the good. And to teach thee His greater care for them, He said not
simply, “He that receiveth a prophet,” or “He that
receiveth a righteous man,” but subjoined, “in the name of
a prophet,” and, “in the name of a righteous man;”
that is, if not for any worldly preferment, nor for any other temporal
thing, he receive him, but because he is either a prophet or a
righteous man, he shall receive a prophet’s reward, and a
righteous man’s reward; such as it were meet for him to have,
that hath received a prophet, or a righteous man; or, such as that
other is himself to receive. Which kind of thing Paul also said:
“That your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their
abundance also may be a supply for your want.”<note n="1485" id="iii.XXXV-p53.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p54"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. viii. 14" id="iii.XXXV-p54.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.14">2 Cor.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p55">Then, lest any one should allege poverty, He saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p56">“Or whosoever shall give to drink unto one of
these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,
verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.”<note n="1486" id="iii.XXXV-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p57"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 43" id="iii.XXXV-p57.1" parsed="|Matt|10|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.43">Matt. x.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p58">“Though a cup of cold water be thy gift, on which
there is nothing laid out, even of this shall a reward be stored up for
thee. For I do all things for the sake of you the receivers.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p59">Seest thou what mighty persuasions He used, and how He
opened to them the houses of the whole world? Yea, He signified that
men are their debtors: first, by saying, “The workman is worthy
of his hire;” secondly, by sending them forth having nothing;
thirdly, by giving them up to wars and fightings in behalf of them that
receive them; fourthly, by committing to them miracles also; fifthly,
in that He did by their lips introduce peace, the cause of all
blessings, into the houses of such as receive them; sixthly, by
threatening things more grievous than Sodom to such as receive them
not: seventhly, by signifying that as many as welcome them are
receiving both Himself and the Father; eighthly, by promising both a
prophet’s and a righteous man’s reward: ninthly, by
undertaking that the recompenses shall be great, even for a cup of cold
water. Now each one of these things, even by itself, were enough to
attract them. For who, tell me, when a

leader of armies wounded in innumerable places,
and dyed in blood, came in sight, returning after many trophies from
war and conflict, would not receive him, throwing open every door in
his house?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p60">5. But who now is like this? one may say. Therefore He
added, “In the name of a disciple, and of a prophet, and of a
righteous man;” to instruct thee that not for the worthiness of
the visitor, but for the purpose of him that gives welcome, is His

men, and disciples, yet elsewhere He bids men receive the veriest

“It is a description of certain jugglers, who used to carry about
swallows trained to come and go when let loose, and settle on their
heads, and take meat out of their mouths. So I conjecture,” Mr.
Field adds, “I have nothing to add to this. For those whom
Athanæus” (from Theognis) “mentions, as <i>gathering a
dole for the swallow</i> (p.360, B.) seem not to answer to what is here
meant. They, by way of begging, used to chant a sort of song about the
coming of the swallow. It was the custom of the Rhodians
particularly.”</p></note>and smut themselves over,<note n="1490" id="iii.XXXV-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p65">Scaliger, Poet i. 10, says, “Some actors in
low comedy were not masked, but smeared with soot;…and used to
dance to music in honor of Bacchus, and bounding forward, to jeer at
every one.” ap. Hoffman, <i>voc. Mimus</i>.</p></note>and abuse every one, receive a reward for this their conjuration. But
if there come to thee a poor man wanting bread, there is no end of
revilings, and reproaches, and charges of idleness, and upbraidings,
and insults, and jeers; and thou considerest not with thyself, that
thou too art idle, and yet God giveth thee His gifts. For tell me not
this, that thou too art doing somewhat, but point me out this rather,
if it be anything really needful that thou doest, and art busy about.
But if thou tellest one of money-getting, and of traffic, and of the
care and increase of thy goods, I also would say unto thee, Not these,
but alms, and prayers, and the protection of the injured, and all such
things, are truly works, with respect to which we live in thorough
idleness. Yet God never told us, “Because thou art idle, I light
not up the sun for thee; because thou doest nothing of real
consequence, I quench the moon, I paralyze the womb of the earth, I
restrain the lakes, the fountains, the rivers, I blot out the
atmosphere: I withhold the annual rains:” but He gives us all
abundantly. And to some that are not merely idle, but even doing evil,
He freely gives the benefit of these things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p66">When therefore thou seest a poor man, and sayest,
“It stops my breath that this fellow, young as he is and healthy,
having nothing, would fain be fed in idleness; he is surely some slave
and runaway, and hath deserted his proper master:” I bid thee
speak these same words to thyself; or rather, permit him freely to
speak them unto thee, and he will say with more justice, “It
stops my breath that thou, being healthy, art idle, and practisest none
of the things which God hath commanded, but having run away from the
commandments of thy Lord, goest about dwelling in wickedness, as in a
strange land, in drunkenness, in surfeiting, in theft, in extortion, in
subverting other men’s houses.” And thou indeed imputest
idleness, but I evil works; in thy plotting, in thy swearing, in thy
lying, in thy spoiling, in thy doing innumerable such things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p67">And this I say, not as making a law in favor of
idleness, far from it; but rather very earnestly wishing all to be
employed; for sloth is the teacher of all wickedness: but I beseech you
not to be unmerciful, nor cruel. Since Paul also, having made infinite
complaints, and said, “If any will not work, neither let him
eat,” stopped not at this, but added, “But ye, be not weary
in well doing.”<note n="1491" id="iii.XXXV-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p68"><scripRef passage="2 Thess. iii. 10, 13" id="iii.XXXV-p68.1" parsed="|2Thess|3|10|0|0;|2Thess|3|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.3.10 Bible:2Thess.3.13">2 Thess.

not as enemies, but admonish them;”<note n="1492" id="iii.XXXV-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p69"><scripRef passage="2 Thess. iii. 14, 15" id="iii.XXXV-p69.1" parsed="|2Thess|3|14|3|15" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.3.14-2Thess.3.15">2 Thess.

each other. Because, if thou art prompt to mercy, both he, the poor
man, will soon be rid of his idleness, and thou of thy cruelty.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p70">“But he hath many lies and inventions,” you
reply. Well, hence again is he pitiable, for that he hath fallen into
such distress, as

<pb n="231" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_231.html" id="iii.XXXV-Page_231" />

to be hardened
even in such doings. But we, so far from pitying, add even those cruel
words, “Hast thou not received once and again?” so we talk.
What then? because he was once fed, hath he no need to be fed again?
Why dost thou not make these laws for thine own belly also, and say to
it likewise, Thou wert filled yesterday, and the day before, seek it
not now? But while thou fillest that beyond measure, even to
bursting,<note n="1493" id="iii.XXXV-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p71">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXV-p71.1">ὑπρ τ μτρον

.]</p></note>from him thou turnest away, when he asks but what is moderate; whereas
thou oughtest therefore to pity him, because he is constrained to come
to thee every day. Yea, if nought else incline thee to him, thou
shouldest pity him because of this; for by the constraint of his
poverty he is forced on these things, and doeth them. And thou dost not
pity him, because, being so spoken to, he feels no shame: the reason
being, that his want is too strong for him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p72">Nay, thou instead of pitying, dost even make a show of
him; and whereas God hath commanded to give secretly, thou standest
exposing publicly him that hath accosted thee, and upbraiding him, for
what ought to move thy pity. Why, if thou art not minded to give, to
what end add reproach, and bruise that weary and wretched soul? He came
as into a harbor, seeking help at thine hands; why stir up waves, and
make the storm more grievous? Why dost thou condemn him of meanness?
What? had he thought to hear such things, would he have come to thee?
Or if he actually came foreseeing this, good cause therefore both to
pity him, and to shudder at thine own cruelty, that not even so, when
thou seest an inexorable necessity laid upon him, dost thou become more
gentle, nor judgest him to have a sufficient excuse for his importunity
in the dread of hunger, but accusest him of impudence: and yet hast
thou often thyself practised greater impudence, yea in respect of
grievous matters. For while here the very impudence brings with it
ground of pardon, we, often doing things punishable, brazen it out: and
when we ought to bear all that in mind, and be humble, we even trample
on those miserable men, and when they ask medicines, we add to their
wounds. I say, if thou wilt not give, yet why dost thou strike? If thou
wilt not be bounteous, yet why be insolent?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p73">“But he submits not to be put off in any other
way.” Well then, as that wise man commanded,<note n="1494" id="iii.XXXV-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p74"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 4.8" id="iii.XXXV-p74.1" parsed="|Sir|4|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.4.8">Ecclus. iv. 8</scripRef>.</p></note>so do. “Answer him peaceable words with meekness.” For not
of his own accord, surely, is he so very importunate. For there is not,
there cannot be, any man desiring to be put to shame for its own sake.
How much soever any may contend, I cannot yield ever to be convinced
that a man who was living in plenty would choose to beg.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p75">6. Let no man then beguile us with arguments. But

“Be not weary in well doing.”<note n="1496" id="iii.XXXV-p76.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p77"><scripRef passage="2 Thess. iii. 13" id="iii.XXXV-p77.1" parsed="|2Thess|3|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.3.13">2 Thess.
iii. 13</scripRef>.</p></note> Even thus do we at home; when any two are striving with each other, we
take each apart, and give them the opposite advice. This did God also,
and Moses. For while to God he said, “If thou wilt forgive them
their sin, forgive it; else blot me out also;”<note n="1497" id="iii.XXXV-p77.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p78"><scripRef passage="Exod. xxxii. 32" id="iii.XXXV-p78.1" parsed="|Exod|32|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.32">Exod.

pertained to them. Yet these things are contrary; nevertheless, both
looked to one end.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p79">Again, God said to Moses in the hearing of the Jews,
“Let me alone, that I may consume the people,”<note n="1498" id="iii.XXXV-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p80"><scripRef passage="Exod. xxxii. 10" id="iii.XXXV-p80.1" parsed="|Exod|32|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.10">Exod.
xxxii. 10</scripRef>.</p></note>(for though they were not present when God was saying this, yet they
were to hear it afterwards): but privately He gives him directions of
the opposite tenor. And this, Moses upon constraint revealed
afterwards, thus saying, “What? did I conceive them, that thou
sayest to me, Carry them, as a nurse would carry the sucking child in
her bosom?”<note n="1499" id="iii.XXXV-p80.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p81"><scripRef passage="Numb. xi. 12" id="iii.XXXV-p81.1" parsed="|Num|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.11.12">Numb. xi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p82">These things are done also in houses, and often a father
while he blames the tutor in private for having used his child
reproachfully, saying, “Be not rough, nor hard,” to the
youth speaks in the contrary way, “Though thou be reproached
unjustly, bear it;” out of those opposites making up some one
wholesome result. Thus also Paul said to such as are in health and beg,
“If any man will not work, neither let him eat,” that he
may urge them into employment: but to such as can show mercy,
“Ye, for your part, be not weary in well doing:” that he
may lead them to give alms.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p83">So also, when he was admonishing those of the Gentiles,
in his Epistle to the Romans, not to be highminded against the Jews, he
brought forward also the wild olive, and he seems to be saying one
thing to these, another to those.<note n="1500" id="iii.XXXV-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p84"><scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 17" id="iii.XXXV-p84.1" parsed="|Rom|11|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.17">Rom. xi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p85">Let us not therefore fall away into cruelty, but let us
listen to Paul, saying, “Be not weary in well doing;” let
us listen to the Lord, who saith, “Give to every man that asketh
of thee,”<note n="1501" id="iii.XXXV-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p86"><scripRef passage="Luke vi. 30" id="iii.XXXV-p86.1" parsed="|Luke|6|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.30">Luke vi.

expression, but with regard to our deeds of mercy only. For nothing so
equals us with God, as doing good.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p88">“But nothing is more shameless,” saith one,
“than a poor man.” Why, I pray thee? Because he runs up,
and cries out after thee? Wilt thou then let me point out, how we are
more importunate than they, and very shameless? Remember, I say, now at
the season of the fast, how often, when thy table was spread at
eventide, and thou hadst called thy ministering servant; on his moving
rather leisurely,<note n="1503" id="iii.XXXV-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p89">[The construction is difficult: <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXV-p89.1">ἵνα

about a little delay; although fully assured, that if not immediately,
yet a little after thou shalt enjoy thy victuals. Upon which thou dost
not call thyself impudent, changed as thou art into a wild beast for
nothing; but the poor man, alarmed and trembling about his greater
interests (for not about delay, but about famine, is all his fear), him
dost thou call audacious, and shameless, and impudent, and all the most
opprobrious names? Nay, how is this anything but extreme impudence.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p90">But these things we do not consider: therefore we
account such men troublesome: since if we at all searched into our own
doings, and compared them with theirs, we should not have thought them
intolerable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p91">Be not then a severe judge. Why, if thou wert clear of
all sins, not even then would the law of God permit thee to be strict
in searching out other men’s sins. And if the Pharisee perished
on this account, what defense are we to find? If He suffer not such as
have done well to be bitter in searching out other men’s doings,
much less them that have offended.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p92">7. Let us not then be savage, nor cruel, not without
natural feeling, not implacable, not worse than wild beasts. For I know
many to have gone even so far in brutishness, as for a little trouble
to slight famishing persons, and to say these words: “I have no
servant now with me; we are far from home; there is no money-changer
that I know.” Oh cruelty! Didst thou promise the greater, and
dost thou not fulfill the less? To save thy walking a little way, doth
he perish with hunger? Oh insolence! Oh pride! Why, if it were ten
furlongs to be walked, oughtest thou to be backward? Doth it not even
come into thy mind that so thy reward is made greater? For whereas,
when thou givest, thou receivest reward for the gift only: when thou
thyself also goest, for this again is appointed thee a recompense.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p93">Yea, the patriarch himself we admire for this, that in
his own person he ran to the herd, and snatched up the calf,<note n="1504" id="iii.XXXV-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p94"><scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 7" id="iii.XXXV-p94.1" parsed="|Gen|18|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.7">Gen. xviii.

servants, and not to be ashamed. “But dost thou require me to do
these things myself?” one may say. “How then shall I not
seem to be vainglorious?” Nay, but as it is, thou art led by
another kind of vainglory to do this, being ashamed to be seen talking
with a poor man.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p96">But I am in no respect strict about this; only give,
whether by thyself or by another thou art minded to do so; and do not
accuse, do not smite, do not revile. For medicines, not wounds, doth he
need who comes unto thee; mercy, not a sword. For tell me, if any one
who had been smitten with a stone, and had received a wound in his
head, were to let go all others, and run unto thy knees, drenched in
his blood; wouldest thou indeed smite him with another stone, and add
unto him another wound? I, for my part, think not; but even as it was,
thou wouldest endeavor to cure it. Why then doest thou the contrary
with respect to the poor? Knowest thou not how much power a word hath,
both to raise up, and to cast down? “For a word,” it is
said, “is better than a gift.”<note n="1506" id="iii.XXXV-p96.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXV-p97"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 18.16" id="iii.XXXV-p97.1" parsed="|Sir|18|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.18.16">Ecclus. xviii. 16</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p98">Dost thou not consider that thou art thrusting the sword
into thyself, and art receiving a more grievous wound, when he, being
reviled, silently withdraws, with groans and many tears? Since indeed
of God he is sent unto thee. Consider then, in insulting him, upon whom
thou art causing the insult to pass; when God indeed sends him unto
thee, and commands thee to give, but thou, so far from giving, dost
even insult him on his coming.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p99">And if thou art not aware how exceedingly amiss this is,
look at it as among men, and then thou wilt fully know the greatness of
the sin. As thus: if a servant of thine had been commanded by thee to
go to another servant, who had money of thine, to receive it, and were
to come back not only with empty hands, but also with despiteful usage;
what wouldest thou not do to him that had wrought the insult? What
penalty wouldest thou not exact, as though, after this, it were thyself
that had been ill used?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p100">This reckoning do thou make in regard of

<pb n="233" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_233.html" id="iii.XXXV-Page_233" />

God also; for truly it is He that sends the
poor to us, and of His we give, if indeed we do give. But if, besides
not giving, we also send them away insulted, consider how many bolts,
how many thunders, that which we are doing deserves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXV-p101">Duly considering then all these things, let us both
bridle our tongue, and put away inhumanity, and let us stretch forth
the hand to give alms, and not with money only, but with words also,
let us relieve such as are in need; that we may both escape the
punishment for reviling, and may inherit the kingdom which is for
blessing and almsgiving, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

How then now, when He hath been made manifest to all, and the fame of
Him hath gone out everywhere, and dead men have been raised, and devils
driven away, and a display made of so great miracles, dost thou after
this send to learn of Him?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p19">What then is the fact? Were all these sayings a kind of
fraud: a stage play and fables? Nay, who that hath any understanding
would say so? I say not, John, who leaped in the womb, who before his
own birth proclaimed Him, the citizen of the wilderness, the exhibitor
of the conversation of

<pb n="234" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_234.html" id="iii.XXXVI-Page_234" />

angels; but
even though he were one of the common sort, and of them that are
utterly outcast, he would not have hesitated, after so many
testimonies, both on his own part and on the part of others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p20">Whence it is evident, that neither did he send as being
himself in doubt, nor did he ask in ignorance. Since no one surely
could say this, that though he knew it fully, yet on account of his
prison he was become rather timid: for neither was he looking to be
delivered therefrom, nor if he did look for it, would he have betrayed
his duty to God, armed as he was against various kinds of death. For
unless he had been prepared for this, he would not have evinced so
great courage towards a whole people, practised in shedding blood of
prophets; nor would he have rebuked that savage tyrant with so much
boldness in the midst of the city and the forum, severely chiding him,
as though he were a little child, in hearing of all men. And even if he
were grown more timid, how was he not ashamed before his own disciples,
in whose presence he had so often borne witness unto Him, but asked his
question by them, which he should have done by others? And yet surely
he knew full well, that they too were jealous of Christ, and desired to
find some handle against Him. And how could he but be abashed before
the Jewish people, in whose presence he had proclaimed such high
things? Or what advantage accrued to him thereby, towards deliverance
from his bonds? For not for Christ’s sake had he been cast into
prison, nor for having proclaimed His power, but for his own rebuke
touching the unlawful marriage. And what child so silly, what person so
frantic, but that so he would have put on himself their character?<note n="1518" id="iii.XXXVI-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p21">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p21.1">οκ ν

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p22">2. What then is it which he is bringing about? For that
it belongs not to John to have doubt hereupon, no nor to any ordinary
person, nor even to one extremely foolish and frenzied; so much is
evident from what we have said. And now we have only to add the
solution.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p23">For what intent then did he send to ask? John’s
disciples were starting aside from Jesus, and this surely any one may
see, and they had always a jealous feeling towards Him. And it is
plain, from what they said to their master: “He that was with
thee,” it is said, “beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest
witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come unto
Him.”<note n="1519" id="iii.XXXVI-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p24"><scripRef passage="John iii. 26" id="iii.XXXVI-p24.1" parsed="|John|3|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.26">John iii.

and the Jews about purifying.”<note n="1520" id="iii.XXXVI-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p25"><scripRef passage="John iii. 25" id="iii.XXXVI-p25.1" parsed="|John|3|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.25">John iii.

on John, Chrysostom distinctly accepts the singular, as do nearly all
Greek <span class="c20" id="iii.XXXVI-p25.3">mss</span>.—R.]</p></note> And again they came unto Him, and said, “Why do we and the
Pharisees fast oft, but Thy disciples fast not?”<note n="1521" id="iii.XXXVI-p25.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p26"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 14" id="iii.XXXVI-p26.1" parsed="|Matt|9|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.14">Matt. ix.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> For as yet they knew not who Christ was, but imagining Jesus to be a
mere man, but John greater than after the manner of man, were vexed at
seeing the former held in estimation, but the latter, as he had said,
now ceasing. And this hindered them from coming unto Him, their
jealousy quite blocking up the access. Now so long as John was with
them, he was exhorting them continually and instructing them, and not
even so did he persuade them; but when he was now on the point of
dying, he uses the more diligence: fearing as he did lest he might
leave a foundation for bad doctrine, and they continue broken off from
Christ. For as he was diligent even at first to bring to Christ all
that pertained to himself; so on his failing to persuade them, now
towards his end he does but exert the more zeal.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p27">Now if he had said, “Go ye away unto Him, He is
better than I,” he would not have persuaded them, minded as they
were not easily to be separated from him, but rather he would have been
thought to say it out of modesty, and they would have been the more
rivetted to him; or if he had held his peace, then again nothing was
gained. What then doth he? He waits to hear from them that Christ is
working miracles, and not even so doth he admonish them, nor doth he
send all, but some two (whom he perhaps knew to be more teachable than
the rest); that the inquiry might be made without suspicion, in order
that from His acts they might learn the difference between Jesus and
himself. And he saith, Go ye, and say, “Art thou He that should
come, or do we look for another?”<note n="1522" id="iii.XXXVI-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 3" id="iii.XXXVI-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|11|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.3">Matt. xi.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p29">But Christ knowing the purpose of John, did not say, I
am He; for this would again have offended the hearers, although this
was what it naturally followed for Him to say, but He leaves them to
learn it from His acts. For it saith, “when these were come to
Him, then “He cured many.”<note n="1523" id="iii.XXXVI-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p30"><scripRef passage="Luke vii. 21" id="iii.XXXVI-p30.1" parsed="|Luke|7|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.21">Luke vii.
21</scripRef>.</p></note> And yet what congruity was there, that being asked, “Art thou
He,” He should say nothing to that, but should presently cure
them that were sick; unless it had been His mind to establish this
which I have mentioned? Because they of course would account the
testimony of His deeds surer, and more above suspicion than that of His
words.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p31">Knowing therefore, as being God, the mind

<pb n="235" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_235.html" id="iii.XXXVI-Page_235" />

with which John had sent them, He straightway
cured blind, lame, and many others; not to teach him (for how should He
him that was convinced), but these that were doubting: and having
healed them, He saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p32">“Go and show John again those things which ye do
hear and see; the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, and the
lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and
the poor have the gospel preached unto them.”<note n="1524" id="iii.XXXVI-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. iv. 5" id="iii.XXXVI-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|4|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.4.5">Matt. iv.

in me;”<note n="1525" id="iii.XXXVI-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 6" id="iii.XXXVI-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|11|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.6">Matt. xi.
6</scripRef>. [R.V., “shall find
none occasion of stumbling in me.”]</p></note>implying that He knows even their unuttered thoughts. For if He had
said, “I am He,” both this would have offended them, as I
have already said; and they would have thought, even if they had not
spoken, much as the Jews said to Him, “Thou bearest record of
Thyself.”<note n="1526" id="iii.XXXVI-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p35"><scripRef passage="John viii. 13" id="iii.XXXVI-p35.1" parsed="|John|8|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.13">John viii.
13</scripRef>. [R.V.,
“witness.”]</p></note> Wherefore He saith not this Himself, but leaves them to learn all from
the miracles, freeing what He taught from suspicion, and making it
plainer. Wherefore also He covertly added His reproof of them. That is,
because they were “offended in Him,” He by setting forth
their case and leaving it to their own conscience alone, and by calling
no witness of this His accusation, but only themselves that knew it
all, did thus also draw them the more unto Himself, in saying, Blessed
is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.” For indeed His
secret meaning was of them when He said this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p36">3. But in order to our making the truth more evident to
you by the comparison of the several statements, producing not only our
own sayings, but also what is stated by others; we must needs add some
account of them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p37">What then do some affirm? That this which we have stated
was not the cause, but that John was in ignorance, yet not in ignorance
of all; but that He was the Christ, he knew, but whether He was also to
die for mankind, he knew not, therefore he said, “Art Thou He
that should come?” that is, He that is to descend into hell.<note n="1527" id="iii.XXXVI-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p38">See Origen, 2 Hom. <i>in Reg</i>. t. ii. p. 495, 6;

term used is “Hades,” not
“Gehenna.”—R.]</p></note> But this is not tenable; for neither of this was John ignorant. This at
least he proclaimed even before all the others, and bare record of this
first, “Behold,” saith he, “the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world.”<note n="1528" id="iii.XXXVI-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p39"><scripRef passage="John i. 29" id="iii.XXXVI-p39.1" parsed="|John|1|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.29">John i.

saying, “That taketh away the sin of the world,” he
declared this same thing. For not otherwise than by the cross did He
effect this; as Paul likewise said: “And the handwriting which
was contrary to us, even it He took out of the way, nailing it to His
cross.”<note n="1529" id="iii.XXXVI-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p40"><scripRef passage="Col. ii. 14" id="iii.XXXVI-p40.1" parsed="|Col|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.2.14">Col. ii.

resurrection.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p42">Well: that He was to rise again, he knew, say they, and
that He was to give the Holy Ghost; but that He should likewise be
crucified, he knew not. How then was He to rise again, who had not
suffered, nor been crucified? And how was this man greater than a
prophet, who knew not even what the prophets knew? For that he was
greater than a prophet, even Christ Himself bare record,<note n="1531" id="iii.XXXVI-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 9" id="iii.XXXVI-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|11|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.9">Matt. xi.

For so Isaiah saith, “He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,
and as a sheep before her shearer is dumb.”<note n="1532" id="iii.XXXVI-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p44"><scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 7" id="iii.XXXVI-p44.1" parsed="|Isa|53|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.7">Isa. liii.

of Jesse, and He that shall rise again to rule the Gentiles, in Him
shall the Gentiles trust.”<note n="1533" id="iii.XXXVI-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p45"><scripRef passage="Isa. xi. 10" id="iii.XXXVI-p45.1" parsed="|Isa|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.11.10">Isa. xi.

“And His rest shall be honor.” And this prophet foretold
not only that He should be crucified, but also with whom.
“For,” saith he, “He was numbered with the
transgressors.”<note n="1534" id="iii.XXXVI-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p46"><scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 12" id="iii.XXXVI-p46.1" parsed="|Isa|53|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.12">Isa. liii.

“For this man,” he saith, “openeth not His
mouth:” and that He should be unjustly condemned; “For in
His humiliation,” saith he, “His judgment was taken
away.”<note n="1535" id="iii.XXXVI-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p47"><scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 8" id="iii.XXXVI-p47.1" parsed="|Isa|53|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.8">Isa. liii.

judgment hall. “Why,” saith he, “do the heathen rage,

and the rulers are gathered together against the Lord, and against His
anointed.”<note n="1536" id="iii.XXXVI-p47.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p48"><scripRef passage="Ps. ii. 1, 2" id="iii.XXXVI-p48.1" parsed="|Ps|2|1|2|2" osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.1-Ps.2.2">Ps. ii. 1,

all exactness, “For they parted my garments,” saith he,
“among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.”<note n="1538" id="iii.XXXVI-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p50"><scripRef passage="Ps. xxii. 18" id="iii.XXXVI-p50.1" parsed="|Ps|22|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.22.18">Ps. xxii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p52">So then the prophets, so many years before, speak of the
hall of judgment, and of the condemnation, and of them that were

crucified with Him, and of the division
of the garments, and of the lot cast upon them, and of many more things
besides (for indeed it is unnecessary to allege all now, lest we make
our discourse long): and was this man, greater than them all, ignorant
of all these things? Nay, how should this be reasonable?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p53">And why did he not say, “Art thou He that should
come to hell,”<note n="1540" id="iii.XXXVI-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p54">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p54.1">ε τν

more absurd than the others, I mean their saying, “he therefore
said these things, that he might preach there also after his
departure.” To whom it were seasonable to say, “Brethren,
be not children in understanding, howbeit in malice be ye
children.”<note n="1541" id="iii.XXXVI-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p55"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiv. 20" id="iii.XXXVI-p55.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.20">1 Cor. xiv.

after death is judgment and punishment. “For in hell,” it
is said, “who will confess unto thee?”<note n="1542" id="iii.XXXVI-p55.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p56"><scripRef passage="Ps. vi. 5" id="iii.XXXVI-p56.1" parsed="|Ps|6|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.6.5">Ps. vi.

the tyranny of death. And besides, this indicates the destruction of
the might of death, not the loosing of the sins of those who had died
before His coming. And if this were not so, but He have delivered all
that were before Him from hell,<note n="1544" id="iii.XXXVI-p58.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p59">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p59.1">γεννη</span>.]</p></note>how saith He, “It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom
and Gomorrah?”<note n="1545" id="iii.XXXVI-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p60"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 15" id="iii.XXXVI-p60.1" parsed="|Matt|10|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.15">Matt. x.

mildly indeed, yet still that they are to be punished. And yet they did
also suffer here the most extreme punishment, nevertheless not even
this will deliver them. And if it is so with them, much more with such
as have suffered nothing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p61">“What then?” one may say, “were they
wronged, who lived before His coming?” By no means, for men might
then be saved, even though they had not confessed Christ. For this was
not required of them, but not to worship idols, and to know the true
God. “For the Lord thy God,” it is said, “is one
Lord.”<note n="1546" id="iii.XXXVI-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p62"><scripRef passage="Deut. vi. 4" id="iii.XXXVI-p62.1" parsed="|Deut|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.6.4">Deut. vi.

law they suffered what they did suffer; and the three children, and
many others too amongst the Jews, having shown forth a very virtuous
life, and having maintained the standard of this their knowledge, had
nothing more required of them. For then it was sufficient for
salvation, as I have said already, to know God only; but now it is so
no more, but there is need also of the knowledge of Christ. Therefore
He said, “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not
had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin.”<note n="1547" id="iii.XXXVI-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p63"><scripRef passage="John xv. 22" id="iii.XXXVI-p63.1" parsed="|John|15|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.15.22">John xv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p64">So likewise with regard to the rule of practice. Then
murder was the destruction of him that committed it, but now even to be
angry. And then to commit adultery, and to lie with another man’s
wife, brought punishment, but now even to look with unchaste eyes. For

perish without law;”<note n="1550" id="iii.XXXVI-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p69"><scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 12" id="iii.XXXVI-p69.1" parsed="|Rom|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.12">Rom. ii.

recount the tragic calamities of the Babylonians, or those of the
Egyptians? But in proof that they who, not having known Christ before
His coming in the flesh, yet refrained from idolatry and worshipped God
only, and showed forth an excellent life, shall enjoy all the
blessings; hear what is said: “But glory, and honor, and peace to
every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the
Gentile.” Seest thou that for their good deeds there are many
rewards, and chastisements again, and penalties for such as have done
the contrary?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p73">4. Where now, tell me, are the utter unbelievers in
hell? Why, if those before Christ’s coming, who had not so much
as heard the name of hell,<note n="1554" id="iii.XXXVI-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p74">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p74.1">γεννη</span>.]</p></note>nor of a resurrection, and were punished here, shall suffer punishment
there also; how much more we that have been nurtured in so many lessons
of strict virtue?<note n="1555" id="iii.XXXVI-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p75"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p75.1">φιλοσοφα</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p76">And how is it reasonable, asks one, that they that have
never heard of hell,<note n="1556" id="iii.XXXVI-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p77">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p77.1">γεννη</span>, and so throughout the
paragraph.—R.]</p></note>should fall into hell? For they will say, “If thou hadst
threatened hell, we should have feared more, and have been
sobered.” To be sure; (is it not so?) at our rate of living now,
who hear daily the sayings about hell, and give no heed at all.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p78">And besides, there is this also to be said; that he who
is not restrained by the judgments in sight, much less will he be
restrained by those others. For the less reasonable sort, and those of
a grosser disposition, are wont to be sobered rather by things which
are at hand, and straightway to happen, than by such as will come to
pass a long time after. “But over us,” one may say,
“a greater fear is suspended, and herein were they
wronged.” By no means. For first, there are not the same
measures<note n="1557" id="iii.XXXVI-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p79"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p79.1">σκμματα</span>.</p></note>set to us as to them, but much greater for us. Now they that have
undertaken greater labors, ought to enjoy greater help. And it is no
little help, that our fear has been increased. And if we have an
advantage over them in knowing things to come, they have an advantage
over us in that the severe punishments are presently laid upon
them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p80">But there is something else, which the multitude say
with respect to this also. For “where,” say they, “is
God’s justice, when any one for sinning here, is punished both
here and there?” Would ye then I should put you in mind of your
own sayings, that ye may no longer give us trouble, but furnish the
solution from within yourselves. I have heard many of our people, if
haply they were told of a murderer cut off in a court of justice, how
they had indignation, and talked in this way: “This unholy and
accursed wretch, having perpetrated thirty murders, or even many more,
hath himself undergone one death only; and where is the justice of
it?” So that ye yourselves confess, that one death is not
sufficient for punishment; how give ye then an opposite sentence now.
Because not others but yourselves are the objects of your judgment: so
great a hindrance is self-love to our perceiving what is just. Because
of this, when we are judging others, we search out all things with
strictness, but when we are sitting in judgment on ourselves, we are
blinded. Since if we were to search into these things in our own case
too, as we do with regard to other men, we should give an uncorrupt
sentence. For we also have sins, deserving not two or three, but ten
thousand deaths. And to pass over all the rest, let us recollect
ourselves, as many of us as partake unworthily of the mysteries; such
men being guilty of the body and blood of Christ. Wherefore, when thou
art talking of the murderer, take account of thyself also. For he
indeed hath murdered a man, but thou art under the guilt of slaying the
Lord; and he, not having partaken of mysteries, but we, while enjoying
the benefit of the sacred table.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p81">And what are they that bite and devour their brethren,
and pour out such abundance of venom? What is he that robs the poor of
their food? For if he who imparts not of his own, is such as I have
said, <i>much more he that takes the things of others</i>.<note n="1558" id="iii.XXXVI-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p82">The words in italics, both here and below, are
omitted in several <span class="c20" id="iii.XXXVI-p82.1">mss</span>.</p></note> How many robbers do the covetous surpass in wickedness! how many
murderers and robbers of tombs, the rapacious! and how many after
spoiling men are desirous even of their blood!</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p83">“Nay,” saith he, “God forbid.”
Now thou sayest, God forbid. When thou hast an enemy, then say, God
forbid, and call to mind what hath been said, and show forth a life
full of great strictness; lest the portion of Sodom await us also, lest
we suffer the lot of Gomorrha, lest we undergo the ills of the Tyrians
and Sidonians; or rather, lest we offend Christ, which were a thing
more grievous <i>and more to be feared</i> than all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVI-p84">For though to many hell<note n="1559" id="iii.XXXVI-p84.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVI-p85">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVI-p85.1">γεννα</span>, and similarly throughout
the paragraph.—R.]</p></note>seem to be a fearful thing, yet I for my part will not cease
continually to say, that this is more grievous and fearful than any
hell; and you I entreat to be of the same mind. For so shall we both be
delivered from hell, and enjoy the glory that is bestowed of Christ;
unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c53" id="iii.XXXVII-p3"><i>“And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto
the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to
see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for to see? A
man clothed in soft raiment; behold, they that wear soft clothing are
in kings’ houses. But what went ye out for to see? A
prophet?</i><note n="1560" id="iii.XXXVII-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p4">[R.V. text, “But wherefore went ye out? to see
a prophet?” In the margin the received reading is given.
Chrysostom gives the latter here, but has the other in his comments.
See sec. 2.—R.]</p></note><i>yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.XXXVII-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XXXVII-p5.1">For</span> the matter indeed of
John’s disciples had been ordered well, and they were gone away
assured by the miracles which had just been performed; but there was
need after that of remedy as regarded the people. For although they
could not suspect anything of the kind of their own master, the common
people might from the inquiry of John’s disciples form many
strange suspicions, not knowing the mind with which he sent his
disciples. And it was natural for them to reason with themselves, and
say, “He that bore such abundant witness, hath he now changed his
persuasion, and doth he doubt whether this or another be He that should
come? Can it be, that in dissension with Jesus he saith this? that the
prison hath made him more timid? that his former words were spoken
vainly, and at random?” It being then natural for them to suspect
many such things, see how He corrects their weakness, and removes these
their suspicions. For “as they departed, He began to say to the
multitudes.” Why, “as they departed?” That He might
not seem to be flattering the man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p6">And in correcting the people, He doth not publish their
suspicion, but adds only the solution of the thoughts that were
mentally disturbing them: signifying that He knew the secrets of all
men. For He saith not, as unto the Jews, “Wherefore think ye
evil?”<note n="1561" id="iii.XXXVII-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p7"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 4" id="iii.XXXVII-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.4">Matt. ix.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> Because if they had it in their minds, not of wickedness did they so
reason, but of ignorance on the points that had been spoken of.
Wherefore neither doth He discourse unto them in the way of rebuke, but
merely sets right their understanding, and defends John, and signifies
that he is not fallen away from his former opinion, neither is he
changed, not being at all a man easily swayed and fickle, but steadfast
and sure, and far from being such as to betray the things committed
unto him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p8">And in establishing this, He employs not at first his
own sentence, but their former testimony, pointing out how they bare
record of his firmness, not by their words only, but also by their
deeds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p9">Wherefore He saith, “What went ye out into the
wilderness to see?” as though He had said, Wherefore did ye leave
your cities, and your houses, and come together all of you into the
wilderness? To see a pitiful and flexible kind of person? Nay, this
were out of all reason, this is not what is indicated by that
earnestness, and the concourse of all men unto the wilderness. So much
people and so many cities would not have poured themselves out with so
great zeal towards the wilderness and the river Jordan at that time,
had ye not expected to see some great and marvellous one, one firmer
than any rock. Yea, it was not “a reed” surely, that
“ye went out to see shaken by the wind:” for the flexible
and such as are lightly brought round, and now say one thing, now
another, and stand firm in nothing, are most like that.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p10">And see how He omits all wickedness, and mentions this,
which then especially haunted<note n="1562" id="iii.XXXVII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p11"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVII-p11.1">ὑφορμοσαν</span></p></note>them; and removes the suspicion of lightness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p12">“But what went ye out for to see? a man clothed in
soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings’
houses.”<note n="1563" id="iii.XXXVII-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p13"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 8" id="iii.XXXVII-p13.1" parsed="|Matt|11|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.8">Matt. xi.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p14">Now His meaning is like this: He was not of himself a
waverer; and this ye yourselves showed by your earnestness. Much less
could any one say this, that he was indeed firm, but having made
himself a slave to luxury, he afterwards became languid. For among men,
some are such as they are of themselves, others become so; for
instance, one man is passionate by nature, and another from having
fallen into a long illness gets this infirmity. Again, some men are
flexible

<pb n="239" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_239.html" id="iii.XXXVII-Page_239" />

and fickle by nature,
while others become so by being slaves to luxury, and by living
effeminately. “But John,” saith He, “neither was such
a character by nature, for neither was it a reed that ye went out to
see; nor by giving himself to luxury did he lose the advantage he
possessed.” For that he did not make himself a slave to luxury,
his garb shows, and the wilderness, and the prison. Since, had he been
minded to wear soft raiment, he would not have lived in the wilderness,
nor in the prison, but in the king’s courts: it being in his
power, merely by keeping silence, to have enjoyed honor without limit.
For since Herod so reverenced him, even when he had rebuked him, and
was in chains, much more would he have courted him, had he held his
peace. You see, he had indeed given proof of his firmness and
fortitude; and how could he justly incur suspicions of that kind?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p15">2. When therefore as well by the place, as by his
garments, and by their concourse unto Him, He had delineated his
character, He proceeds to bring in the prophet. For having said,
“Why went ye out? To see a prophet? Yea I say unto you, and more
than a prophet;”<note n="1564" id="iii.XXXVII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 9" id="iii.XXXVII-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|11|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.9">Matt. xi.
9</scripRef>. [See note 1, p. 243.]</p></note> He goes on, “For this is he of whom it is written,<note n="1565" id="iii.XXXVII-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p17">See <scripRef passage="Mal. iii. 1" id="iii.XXXVII-p17.1" parsed="|Mal|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mal.3.1">Mal.

way before Thee.”<note n="1566" id="iii.XXXVII-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 10" id="iii.XXXVII-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|11|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.10">Matt. xi.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> Having before set down the testimony of the Jews, He then applies that
of the prophets; or rather, He puts in the first place the sentence of
the Jews, which must have been a very strong demonstration, the witness
being borne by his enemies; secondly, the man’s life; thirdly,
His own judgment; fourthly, the prophet; by all means stopping their
mouths.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p19">Then lest they should say, “But what if at that
time indeed he were such an one, but now is changed?” He added
also what follows; his garments, his prison, and together with these
the prophecy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p20">Then having said, that he is greater than a prophet, He
signifies also in what he is greater. And in what is he greater? In
being near Him that was come. For, “I send,” saith He,
“my messenger before Thy face;” that is, nigh Thee. For as
with kings, they who ride near the chariot, these are more illustrious
than the rest, just so John also appears in his course near the advent
itself. See how He signified John’s excellency by this also; and
not even here doth He stop, but adds afterwards His own suffrage as
well, saying, “Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of
women, there hath not arisen a greater than John the
Baptist.”<note n="1567" id="iii.XXXVII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 11" id="iii.XXXVII-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|11|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.11">Matt. xi.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p22">Now what He said is like this: “woman hath not
borne a greater than this man.” And His very sentence is indeed
sufficient; but if thou art minded to learn from facts also, consider
his table, his manner of life, the height of his soul.<note n="1568" id="iii.XXXVII-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p23">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVII-p23.1">τ
γνμη</span>; “zeal” would be a better
rendering, though there is no precise English equivalent.—R.]</p></note> For he so lived as though he were in heaven: and having got above the
necessities of nature, he travelled as it were a new way, spending all
his time in hymns and prayers, and holding intercourse with none among
men, but with God alone continually. For he did not so much as see any
of his fellow-servants, neither was he seen by any one of them; he fed
not on milk, he enjoyed not the comfort of bed, or roof, or market, or
any other of the things of men; and yet he was at once mild and
earnest. Hear, for example, how considerately he reasons with his own
disciples, courageously with the people of the Jews, how openly with
the king. For this cause He said also, “There hath not risen
among them that are born of women a greater than John the
Baptist.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p24">3. But lest the exceeding greatness of His praises
should produce a sort of extravagant feeling, the Jews honoring John
above Christ; mark how He corrects this also. For as the things which
edified His own disciples did harm to the multitudes, they supposing
Him an easy kind of person; so again the remedies employed for the
multitudes might have proved more mischievous, they deriving from
Christ’s words a more reverential opinion of John than of
Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p25">Wherefore this also, in an unsuspected way, He corrects
by saying, “He that is less,<note n="1569" id="iii.XXXVII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p26">[R.V., “but little;” Gr.
“lesser.”]</p></note>in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.” Less in age, and
according to the opinion of the multitude, since they even called Him
“a gluttonous man and a winebibber;”<note n="1570" id="iii.XXXVII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 19" id="iii.XXXVII-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|11|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.19">Matt. xi.

55</scripRef>.</p></note>and on every occasion they used to make light of Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p29">“What then?” it may be said, “is it by
comparison that He is greater than John?” Far from it. For
neither when John saith, “He is mightier than I,”<note n="1572" id="iii.XXXVII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 11" id="iii.XXXVII-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|3|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.11">Matt. iii.

writes, “For this man was counted worthy of more glory than
Moses,”<note n="1573" id="iii.XXXVII-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p31"><scripRef passage="Heb. iii. 3" id="iii.XXXVII-p31.1" parsed="|Heb|3|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.3.3">Heb. iii.

“Behold, a greater than

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p33">Or if we should even grant that this was said by Him in
the way of comparison, this was done in condescension,<note n="1575" id="iii.XXXVII-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p34">Or, “by way of economy;” <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVII-p34.1">οκονομικ</span>.</p></note>because of the weakness of the hearers. For the men really had their
gaze very much fixed upon John; and then he was rendered the more
illustrious both by his imprisonment, and by his plainness of speech to
the king; and it was a great point for the present, that even so much
should be received among the multitude. And so too, the Old Testament
uses in the same way to correct the souls of the erring, by putting
together in a way of comparison things that cannot be compared; as when
it saith, “Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, O
Lord:”<note n="1576" id="iii.XXXVII-p34.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p35"><scripRef passage="Ps. lxxxvi. 8" id="iii.XXXVII-p35.1" parsed="|Ps|86|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.86.8">Ps. lxxxvi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p37">Now some affirm, that Christ said this of the apostles,
others again, of angels.<note n="1578" id="iii.XXXVII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p38">“Many will understand this of the Saviour; that
he who is less in time is greater in dignity. But let us simply
understand, that every Saint who is already with God is greater than he
whose post is yet in the battle. For it is one thing to possess the
crown of victory, another still to fight in the battle. Some will take
it that the lowest angel serving God in Heaven is greater than any,
even the first of men who as yet dwells on earth.” St. Jerome,
<i>in loco</i>.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p39">“Finally, it is so utterly impossible that there
should be any comparison between John and the Son of God, that the
former is of less esteem even than the angels. Thus, on the one hand,
inasmuch as He had called him an angel” (<scripRef passage="Mal. iii. 1" id="iii.XXXVII-p39.1" parsed="|Mal|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mal.3.1">Mal. iii. 1</scripRef>), “He is of course set above men;
on the other, because he had declared him chief among those born of
women, He therefore added, <i>For he who is lesser in the kingdom of
heaven is greater than he</i>: that you might know he could not compare
with the angels.” St. Ambr. on St. Luke, vii. 27; St. Aug.
<i>Contr. Advers. Legis et Proph</i>. ii. xx, states both
interpretations, without any preference for either. But in his 13
<i>Tract. on St. John</i>, c. ii. he gives the same as St.
Chrysostom.</p></note> Thus, when any have turned aside from the truth, they are wont to
wander many ways. For what sort of connexion hath it, to speak either
of angels or of apostles? And besides, if He were speaking of the
apostles, what hindered his bringing them forward by name? whereas,
when He is speaking of Himself, He naturally conceals His person,
because of the still prevailing suspicion, and that He may not seem to
say anything great of Himself; yea, and we often find Him doing so.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p40">But what is, “In the kingdom of heaven?”
Among spiritual beings, and all them that are in heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p41">And moreover His saying, “There hath not risen
among them that are born of women a greater than John,” suited
one contrasting John with Himself, and thus tacitly excepting Himself.
For though He too were born of a woman, yet not as John, for He was not
a mere man, neither was He born in like manner as a man, but by a
strange and wondrous kind of birth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p42">4. “And from the days of John the Baptist,”
saith He, “until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence,
and the violent take it by force.”<note n="1579" id="iii.XXXVII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 12" id="iii.XXXVII-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.12">Matt. xi.

violence.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p44">And what sort of connexion may this have with what was
said before? Much, assuredly, and in full accordance therewith. Yea, by
this topic also He proceeds to urge and press them into the faith of
Himself; and at the same time likewise, He is speaking in agreement
with what had been before said by John. “For if all things are
fulfilled even down to John, I am “He that should
come.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p45">“For all the prophets,” saith He, “and
the law prophesied until John.”<note n="1580" id="iii.XXXVII-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 13" id="iii.XXXVII-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|11|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.13">Matt. xi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p47">For the prophets would not have ceased, unless I were
come. Expect therefore nothing further, neither wait for any one else.
For that I am He is manifest both from the prophets ceasing, and from
those that every day “take by force” the faith that is in
me. For so manifest is it and certain, that many even take it by force.
Why, who hath so taken it? tell me. All who approach it with
earnestness of mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p48">Then He states also another infallible sign, saying,
“If ye will receive it, he is Elias, which was for to
come.” For “I will send you,” it is said,
“Elias the Tishbite, who shall turn the heart of the father to
the children.”<note n="1581" id="iii.XXXVII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p49"><scripRef passage="Mal. iv. 5, 6" id="iii.XXXVII-p49.1" parsed="|Mal|4|5|4|6" osisRef="Bible:Mal.4.5-Mal.4.6">Mal. iv. 5,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p51">And well hath He said, “If ye will receive
it,” to show the absence of force. For I do not constrain, saith
He. And this He said, as requiring a candid mind, and showing that John
is Elias, and Elias John. For both of them received one ministry, and
both of them became forerunners. Wherefore neither did He simply say,
“This is Elias,” but, “If ye are willing to receive
it, this is he,” that is, if with a candid mind ye give heed to
what is going on. And He did not stop even at this, but to the words,
“This is Elias, which was for to come,” He added, to show
that understanding is needed, He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.”<note n="1583" id="iii.XXXVII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p52"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 15" id="iii.XXXVII-p52.1" parsed="|Matt|11|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.15">Matt. xi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p53">Now He used so many dark sayings, to stir them up to
inquiry. And if not even so were they awakened, much more, had all been
plain and clear. For this surely no man could say, that they dared not
ask Him, and that He was difficult of approach. For they that were
asking him questions, and

<pb n="241" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_241.html" id="iii.XXXVII-Page_241" />

tempting
Him about common matters, and whose mouths were stopped a thousand
times, yet they did not withdraw from Him; how should they but have
inquired of Him, and besought Him touching the indispensable things,
had they indeed been desirous to learn? For if concerning the matters
of the law they asked, “Which is the first commandment,”
and all such questions, although there was of course no need of His
telling them that; how should they but ask the meaning of what He
Himself said, for which also He was bound to give account in His
answers? And especially when it was He Himself that was encouraging and
drawing them on to do this. For by saying, “The violent take it
by force,” He stirs them up to earnestness of mind; and by
saying, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” He doth
just the same thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p54">5. “But whereunto shall I liken this
generation?” saith He, “It is like unto children sitting in
the market place, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not
danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.”<note n="1584" id="iii.XXXVII-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p55"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 16, 17" id="iii.XXXVII-p55.1" parsed="|Matt|11|16|11|17" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.16-Matt.11.17">Matt. xi.

“We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did
not mourn (Greek, beat the breast).”—R.]</p></note> This again seems to be unconnected with what came before, but it is the
most natural consequence thereof. Yea, He still keeps to the same
point, the showing that John is acting in harmony with Himself,
although the results were opposite; as indeed with respect to his
inquiry also. And He implies that there was nothing that ought to have
been done for their salvation, and was omitted; which thing the
prophet<note n="1585" id="iii.XXXVII-p55.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p56"><scripRef passage="Isa. v. 4" id="iii.XXXVII-p56.1" parsed="|Isa|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.5.4">Isa. v.

vineyard, and have not done it? For whereunto,” saith He,
“shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting
in the market, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not
danced, we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. For John
came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.<note n="1586" id="iii.XXXVII-p56.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p57">[“demon.”]</p></note> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p59">Now what He saith is like this: We have come each of us
an opposite way, I and John; and we have done just as if it were some
hunters with a wild beast that was hard to catch, and which might by
two ways fall into the toils; as if each of the two were to cut it off
his several way, and drive it, taking his stand opposite to the other;
so that it must needs fall into one of the two snares. Mark, for
instance, the whole race of man, how it is astonished at the wonder of
men’s fasting, and at this hard and self-denying life. For this
reason it had been so ordered, that John should be thus brought up from
his earliest youth, so that hereby (among other things) his sayings
might obtain credit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p60">But wherefore, it may be asked, did not He Himself
choose that way? In the first place He did also Himself proceed by it,
when He fasted the forty days, and went about teaching, and not having
where to lay His head. Nevertheless He did also in another mode
accomplish this same object, and provide for the advantage thence
accruing. For to be testified of by him that came this way was the same
thing, or even a much greater thing than to have come this way
Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p61">And besides, John indeed exhibited no more than his life
and conversation; for “John,” it is said, “did no
sign,”<note n="1588" id="iii.XXXVII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p62"><scripRef passage="John x. 41" id="iii.XXXVII-p62.1" parsed="|John|10|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.41">John x.
41</scripRef>.</p></note>but He Himself had the testimony also from signs and from miracles.
Leaving therefore John to be illustrious by his fasting, He Himself
came the opposite way, both coming unto publicans’ tables, and
eating and drinking.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p63">Let us ask the Jews then, “Is fasting a good
thing, and to be admired? you should then have obeyed John, and
received him, and believed his sayings. For so would those sayings have
led you towards Jesus. Is fasting, on the other hand, a thing grievous,
and burdensome? then should you have obeyed Jesus, and have believed in
Him that came the opposite way. Thus, either way, ye would have found
yourselves in the kingdom.” But, like an intractable wild beast,
they were speaking evil of both. The fault is not then theirs who were
not believed, but they are to be blamed who did not believe. For no man
would ever choose to speak evil of opposite things, any more than he
would on the other hand commend them. I mean thus: he that approves the
cheerful and free character, will not approve him that is sad and
grave; he that commends the man of a sad countenance will not commend
the cheerful man. For it is a thing impossible to give your vote both
ways at once. Therefore also He saith, “We have piped unto you,
and ye have not danced;” that is, “I have exhibited the
freer kind of life, and ye obeyed not:” and, “We have
mourned, and ye have not lamented;” that is, “John followed
the rugged and grave life, and ye took no heed.” And He saith
not, “he this, I that,” but the purpose of both being one,
although their

<pb n="242" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_242.html" id="iii.XXXVII-Page_242" />

modes of life were
opposite, for this cause He speaks of their doings as common. Yea, for
even their coming by opposite ways arose out of a most exact
accordance, such as continued looking to one and the same end. What
sort of excuse then can ye have after all this?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p64">Wherefore He subjoined, “And wisdom is justified
of her children;”<note n="1589" id="iii.XXXVII-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p65"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 19" id="iii.XXXVII-p65.1" parsed="|Matt|11|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.19">Matt. xi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p67">And if the similitudes be mean, and of an ill sound,
marvel not, for He was discoursing with a view to the weakness of His
hearers. Since Ezekiel too mentions many similitudes like them, and
unworthy of God’s majesty.<note n="1591" id="iii.XXXVII-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p68">See <scripRef passage="Ezek. iv. 5, 12, 13, 24" id="iii.XXXVII-p68.1" parsed="|Ezek|4|5|0|0;|Ezek|4|12|0|0;|Ezek|4|13|0|0;|Ezek|4|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.4.5 Bible:Ezek.4.12 Bible:Ezek.4.13 Bible:Ezek.4.24">Ezek.

but upbraid.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p83">Thus elsewhere also He makes a comparison, condemning
them by the Ninevites, and by the Queen of the south; there, however,
it was by them that did right, here, even by them that sinned; a thing
far more grievous. With this law of condemnation, Ezekiel too was
acquainted: wherefore also he said to Jerusalem, “Thou hast

their fears yet more intense, by saying, that they should suffer things
more grievous than Sodomites and Tyrians, so as by every means to
gather them in, both by bewailing, and by alarming them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p85">7. To these same things let us also listen: since not
for the unbelievers only, but for us also, hath He appointed a
punishment more grievous than that of the Sodomites, if we will not
receive the strangers that come in unto us; I mean, when He commanded
to shake off the very dust: and very fitly. For as to the Sodomites,
although they committed a great transgression, yet it was before the
law and grace; but we, after so much care shown towards us, of what
indulgence should we be worthy, showing so much inhospitality, and
shutting our doors against them that are in need, and before our doors
our ears? or rather not against the poor only, but against the apostles
themselves? For therefore we

<pb n="243" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_243.html" id="iii.XXXVII-Page_243" />

do it
to the poor, because we do it to the very apostles. For whereas Paul is
read, and thou attendest not; whereas John preaches, and thou hearest
not: when wilt thou receive a poor man, who wilt not receive an
apostle?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p86">In order then that both our houses may be continually

debts, and the business of usury and loans, close up the ear of the
mind, worse than any filth; nay rather, they do not close it up only,

enacted by the Gentiles would have them to be dishonored, thou
receivest them with thy whole city, like ambassadors and generals, and
dost convoke all men, to receive dung in their ears. And thy servant,
if he say anything filthy in thy hearing, will receive stripes in
abundance; and be it a son, a wife, whoever it may, that doth as I have
said, thou callest the act an affront; but if worthless fellows, that
deserve the scourge, should invite thee to hear the filthy words, not
only art thou not indignant, thou dost even rejoice and applaud. And
what could be equal to this folly?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p89">But dost thou thyself never utter these base words? Why
what is the profit? or rather, this very fact, whence is it manifest?
For if thou didst not utter these things, neither wouldest thou at all
laugh at hearing them, nor wouldest thou run with such zeal to the
voice that makes thee ashamed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p90">For tell me, art thou pleased at hearing men blaspheme?
Dost thou not rather shudder, and stop thine ears? Surely I think thou
dost. Why so? Because thou blasphemest not thyself. Just so do thou act
with respect to filthy talking also; and if thou wouldest show us
clearly, that thou hast no pleasure in filthy speaking, endure not so
much as to hear them. For when wilt thou be able to become good, bred
up as thou art with such sounds in thine ears? When wilt thou venture
to undergo such labors as chastity requires, now that thou art falling
gradually away through this laughter, these songs, and filthy words?
Yea, it is a great thing for a soul that keeps itself pure from all
this, to be able to become grave and chaste; how much more for one that
is nourished up in such hearings? Know ye not, that we are of the two
more inclined to evil? While then we make it even an art, and a
business, when shall we escape that furnace?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p94">For even all the mire that is there poured out for you,

even into his own mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p95">And from things not worthy of abhorrence thou turnest
away; while others which are to be abhorred, so far from hating, thou
dost even court. Many, for instance, on coming back from tombs, are
used to wash themselves, but on returning from theatres they have never
groaned, nor poured forth any fountains of tears; yet surely the dead
man is no unclean thing, whereas sin induces such a blot, that not even
with ten thousand fountains could one purge it away, but with tears
only, and with confessions. But no one hath any sense of this blot.
Thus because we fear not what we ought, therefore we shrink from what
we ought not.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p96">And what again is the applause? what the

<pb n="244" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_244.html" id="iii.XXXVII-Page_244" />

tumult, and the satanical cries, and the
devilish gestures? For first one, being a young man, wears his hair
long behind, and changing his nature into that of a woman, is striving
both in aspect, and in gesture, and in garments, and generally in all
ways, to pass into the likeness of a tender damsel.<note n="1603" id="iii.XXXVII-p96.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p97">The women in plays were personated by men: those
mentioned below were singers; the slave’s part is described in
the next sentence.</p></note> Then another who is grown old, in the opposite way to this, having his
hair shaven, and with his loins girt about, his shame cut off before
his hair, stands ready to be smitten with the rod, prepared both to say
and do anything. The women again, their heads uncovered, stand without
a blush, discoursing with a whole people, so complete is their practice
in shamelessness; and thus pour forth all effrontery and impurity into
the souls of their hearers. And their one study is, to pluck up all
chastity from the foundations, to disgrace our nature, to satiate the
desire of the wicked demon. Yea, and there are both foul sayings, and
gestures yet fouler; and the dressing of the hair tends that way, and
the gait, and apparel, and voice, and flexure of the limbs; and there
are turnings of the eyes, and flutes, and pipes, and dramas, and plots;
and all things, in short, full of the most extreme impurity. When then
wilt thou be sober again, I pray thee, now that the devil is pouring
out for thee so much of the strong wine of whoredom, mingling so many
cups of unchastity? For indeed both adulteries and stolen marriages are
there, and there are women playing the harlot, men prostituting, youths
corrupting themselves: all there is iniquity to the full, all sorcery,
all shame. Wherefore they that sit by should not laugh at these things,
but weep and groan bitterly.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p98">“What then? Are we to shut up the stage?” it
will be said, “and are all things to be turned upside down at thy
word?” Nay, but as it is, all things are turned upside down. For
whence are they, tell me, that plot against our marriages? Is it not
from this theatre? Whence are they that dig through into chambers? Is
it not from that stage? Comes it not of this, when husbands are
insupportable to their wives? of this, when the wives are contemptible
to their husbands? of this, that the more part are adulterers? So that
the subverter of all things is he that goes to the theatre; it is he
that brings in a grievous tyranny. “Nay,” thou wilt say,
“this is appointed by the good order of the laws.” Why, to
tear away men’s wives, and to insult young boys, and to overthrow
houses, is proper to those who have seized on citadels.<note n="1604" id="iii.XXXVII-p98.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p99"><i>i.e</i>., to tyrants, such as Pisistratus and
others.</p></note>“And what adulterer,” wilt thou say, “hath been made
such by these spectacles?” Nay, who hath not been made an
adulterer? And if one might but mention them now by name, I could point
out how many husbands those harlots have severed from their wives, how
many they have taken captive, drawing some even from the marriage bed
itself, not suffering others so much as to live at all in marriage.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p100">“What then? I pray thee, are we to overthrow all
the laws?” Nay, but it is overthrowing lawlessness, if we do away
with these spectacles. For hence are they that make havoc in our
cities; hence, for example, are seditions and tumults. For they that
are maintained by the dancers, and who sell their own voice to the
belly, whose work it is to shout, and to practise everything that is
monstrous, these especially are the men that stir up the populace, that
make the tumults in our cities. For youth, when it hath joined hands
with idleness, and is brought up in so great evils, becomes fiercer
than any wild beast. The necromancers too, I pray thee, whence are
they? Is it not from hence, that in order to excite the people who are
idling without object, and make the dancing men have the benefit of
much and loud applause, and fortify the harlot women against the
chaste, they proceed so far in sorcery, as not even to shrink from
disturbing the bones of the dead? Comes it not hence, when men are
forced to spend without limit on that wicked choir of the devil? And
lasciviousness, whence is that, and its innumerable mischiefs? Thou
seest, it is thou who art subverting our life, by drawing men to these
things, while I am recruiting it by putting them down.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p101">“Let us then pull down the stage,” say they.
Would that it were possible to pull it down; or rather, if ye be
willing, as far as regards us, it is pulled down, and digged up.
Nevertheless, I enjoin no such thing. Standing as these places are, I
bid you make them of no effect; which thing were a greater praise than
pulling them down.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p102">9. Imitate at least the barbarians, if no one else; for
they verily are altogether clean from seeking such sights. What excuse
then can we have after all this, we, the citizens of Heaven, and
partners in the choirs of the cherubim, and in fellowship with the
angels, making ourselves in this respect worse even than the
barbarians, and this, when innumerable other pleasures, better than
these, are within our reach?</p>

<pb n="245" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_245.html" id="iii.XXXVII-Page_245" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p103">Why, if thou desirest that thy soul may find delight, go
to pleasure grounds, to a river flowing by, and to lakes, take notice
of gardens, listen to grasshoppers as they sing, be continually by the
coffins of martyrs, where is health of body and benefit of soul, and no
hurt, no remorse after the pleasure, as there is here.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p104">Thou hast a wife, thou hast children; what is equal to
this pleasure? Thou hast a house, thou hast friends, these are the true
delights: besides their purity, great is the advantage they bestow. For
what, I pray thee, is sweeter than children? what sweeter than a wife,
to him that will be chaste in mind?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p105">To this purpose, we are told, that the barbarians
uttered on some occasion a saying full of wise severity. I mean, that
having heard of these wicked spectacles, and the unseasonable delight
of them; “why the Romans,” say they, “have devised
these pleasures, as though they had not wives and children;”
implying that nothing is sweeter than children and wife, if thou art
willing to live honestly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p106">“What then,” one may say, “if I point
to some, who are nothing hurt by their pastime in that place?” In
the first place, even this is a hurt, to spend one’s time without
object or fruit, and to become an offense to others. For even if thou
shouldest not be hurt, thou makest some other more eager herein. And
how canst thou but be thyself hurt, giving occasion to what goes on?
Yea, both the fortune-teller, and the prostitute boy, and the harlot
woman, and all those choirs of the devil, cast upon thy head the blame
of their proceedings. For as surely as, if there were no spectators,
there would be none to follow these employments; so, since there are,
they too have their share of the fire due to such deeds. So that even
if in chastity thou wert quite unhurt (a thing impossible), yet for
others’ ruin thou wilt render a grievous account; both the
spectators’, and that of those who assemble them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p107">And in chastity too thou wouldest profit more, didst
thou refrain from going thither. For if even now thou art chaste, thou
wouldest have become chaster by avoiding such sights. Let us not then
delight in useless argument, nor devise unprofitable apologies: there
being but one apology, to flee from the Babylonian furnace, to keep far
from the Egyptian harlot, though one must escape her hands naked.<note n="1605" id="iii.XXXVII-p107.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVII-p108"><scripRef passage="Gen. xxxix. 12" id="iii.XXXVII-p108.1" parsed="|Gen|39|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.39.12">Gen. xxxix.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVII-p109">For so shall we both enjoy much delight, our conscience
not accusing us, and we shall live this present life with chastity, and
attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man
of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom be glory and might, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

also
He made mention of the parable of the children. Fifthly, by His
upbraiding them that had not believed, and by His alarming and
threatening them greatly.<note n="1612" id="iii.XXXVIII-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p11"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 20-24" id="iii.XXXVIII-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|11|20|11|24" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.20-Matt.11.24">Matt. xi.
20–24</scripRef>.</p></note> Sixthly, by His giving thanks for them that believed. For the
expression, “I make acknowledgment to Thee,” here is,
“I thank Thee.” “I thank Thee,” He saith,
“because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p12">What then? doth He rejoice in destruction, and in the
others not having received this knowledge? By no means; but this is a
most excellent way of His to save men, His not forcing them that
utterly reject, and are not willing to receive His sayings; that, since
they were not bettered by His call, but fell back, and despised it, His
casting them out might cause them to fall into a longing for these
things. And so likewise the attentive would grow more earnest.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p13">And while His being revealed to these was fit matter of
joy, His concealment from those was no more of joy but of tears. Thus
at any rate He acts, where He weeps for the city. Not therefore because
of this doth He rejoice, but because what wise men knew not, was known
to these. As when Paul saith, “I thank God, that ye were servants
of sin, but ye obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine which was
delivered unto you.”<note n="1613" id="iii.XXXVIII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p14"><scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 17" id="iii.XXXVIII-p14.1" parsed="|Rom|6|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.17">Rom. vi.
17</scripRef>. [R.V., “that form
of teaching whereunto ye were delivered.” The A.V. renders the
passage incorrectly: there being no doubt as to the Greek text. The
R.V. also brings out the thought which the Homily
indicates.—R.]</p></note> You see, neither doth Paul therefore rejoice, because they were
“servants of sin,” but because being such, they had been so
highly favored.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p15">Now by the “wise,” here, He means the
Scribes, and the Pharisees. And these things He saith, to make the
disciples more earnest, and to show what had been vouchsafed to the
fishermen, when all those others had missed of it. And in calling them
“wise,” He means not the true and commendable wisdom, but
this which they seemed to have through natural shrewdness. Wherefore
neither did He say, “thou hast revealed it to fools,” but
“to babes;” to unsophisticated, that is, to simple-minded
men; and He implies that so far from their missing these privileges
contrary to their desert, it was just what might be expected. And He
instructs us throughout, to be free from pride, and to follow after
simplicity. For this cause Paul also expressed it with more exceeding
earnestness, writing on this wise: “If any man among you seemeth
to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
wise.”<note n="1614" id="iii.XXXVIII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. iii. 18" id="iii.XXXVIII-p16.1" parsed="|1Cor|3|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.3.18">1 Cor. iii.
18</scripRef>.</p></note> For thus is God’s grace manifested.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p17">But wherefore doth He give thanks to the Father,
although of course it was Himself who wrought this? As He prays and
intercedes with God, showing His great love towards us, in the same way
doth He this too: for this also is of much love. And He signifies, that
not from Him only had they fallen away, but also from the Father. Thus,
what He said, speaking to His disciples, “Cast not the holy
things unto dogs,”<note n="1615" id="iii.XXXVIII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 6" id="iii.XXXVIII-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|7|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.6">Matt. vii.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>this He Himself anticipated them in performing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p19">Moreover He signifies hereby both His own principal<note n="1616" id="iii.XXXVIII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p20"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVIII-p20.1">προηγομενον</span>.
In the same sense in which Hooker says, “He willeth positively
that which Himself worketh; He willeth by permission that which His
creatures do.” E. P. v. App. No. 1, p. 714, cf. in Walton’s
Life, p. 29. “That in God there were two wills, an antecedent and
a consequent will; His first will, that all mankind should be saved;
His second, that those only should be saved, who lived answerable to
that degree of grace which He had offered.”</p></note>will, and that of the Father; His own, I say, by His giving thanks and
rejoicing at what had taken place; His Father’s, by intimating
that neither had He done this upon entreaty, but of Himself upon His
own will; “For so,” saith He, “it seemed good in Thy
sight:” that is, “so it pleased Thee.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p21">And wherefore was it hidden from them? Hear Paul,
saying, that “Seeking to establish their own righteousness, they
have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.”<note n="1617" id="iii.XXXVIII-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p22"><scripRef passage="Rom. x. 3" id="iii.XXXVIII-p22.1" parsed="|Rom|10|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.3">Rom. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p23">Consider now how it was likely the disciples should<note n="1618" id="iii.XXXVIII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p24">[“would;” but the whole clause has been
freely paraphrased.—R.]</p></note>be affected, hearing this; that what wise men knew not, these knew, and
knew it continuing babes, and knew it by God’s revelation. But
Luke saith, that “at the very hour,” when the seventy came
telling Him about the devils, then He “rejoiced” and spake
these things,<note n="1619" id="iii.XXXVIII-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p25"><scripRef passage="Luke x. 21" id="iii.XXXVIII-p25.1" parsed="|Luke|10|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.21">Luke x.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>which, besides increasing their diligence, would also dispose them to
be modest. That is, since it was natural for them to pride themselves
on their driving away devils, on this among other grounds He refrains
them; that it was a revelation, whatever had been done, no diligence on
their part. Wherefore also the scribes, and the wise men, thinking to
be intelligent for themselves, fell away through their own vanity. Well
then, if for this cause it was hidden from them, “do you
also,” saith He, “fear, and continue babes.” For this
caused you to have the benefit of the revelation, as indeed on the
other hand the contrary made them be deprived of it. For by

no means, when He saith, “Thou hast
hid,” doth He mean that it is all God’s doing: but as when

irrelevant, since it speaks of “the god of this

the occasion: so here also He uses the expression, “Thou hast

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p28">For since He had said, “I thank<note n="1622" id="iii.XXXVIII-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p29">[See above, and note 1, p. 250.—R.]</p></note> Thee, because Thou hast hid them, and hast revealed them unto

Father.”<note n="1623" id="iii.XXXVIII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 27" id="iii.XXXVIII-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|11|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.27">Matt. xi.

“Nay, why marvel,” saith He,<note n="1624" id="iii.XXXVIII-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p32"><scripRef passage="Luke x. 22" id="iii.XXXVIII-p32.1" parsed="|Luke|10|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.22">Luke x.
22</scripRef>.</p></note>“that devils yield to you? All things are mine; “All things
are delivered unto me.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p33">But when thou hearest, “they are delivered,”
do not surmise anything human. For He uses this expression, to prevent
thine imagining two unoriginate Gods. Since, that He was at the same
time both begotten, and Lord of all, He declares in many ways, and in
other places also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p34">2. Then He saith what is even greater than this, lifting
up thy mind; “And no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither
knoweth any man the Father, but the Son.” Which seems indeed to
the ignorant unconnected with what went before, but hath full
accordance therewith. As thus: having said, “All things are
delivered unto me of my Father,” He adds, “And what
marvel,” so He speaks, “if I be Lord of all? I who have
also another greater privilege, the knowing the Father, and being of
the same substance.” Yea, for this too He covertly signifies by
His being the only one who so knew Him. For this is His meaning, when
He saith, “No man knoweth the Father but the Son.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p35">And see at what time He saith this. When they by His
works had received the certain proof of His might, not only seeing Him
work miracles, but endowed also in His name with so great powers. Then,
since He had said, “Thou hast revealed them unto babes,” He
signifies this also to pertain to Himself; for “neither knoweth
any man the Father,” saith He, “save the Son, and he to
whomsoever the Son is willing<note n="1625" id="iii.XXXVIII-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p36"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVIII-p36.1">βοληται</span>. [R.V.,

27</scripRef>.</p></note>not “to whomsoever He may be enjoined,” “to
whomsoever He may be commanded.” But if He reveals Him, then
Himself too. This however He let pass as acknowledged, but the other He
hath set down. And everywhere He affirms this; as when He saith,
“No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”<note n="1627" id="iii.XXXVIII-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p38"><scripRef passage="John xiv. 6" id="iii.XXXVIII-p38.1" parsed="|John|14|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.14.6">John xiv.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p39">And thereby he establishes another point also, His being
in harmony and of one mind with Him. “Why,” saith He,
“I am so far from fighting and warring with Him, that no one can
even come to Him but by me.” For because this most offended them,
His seeming to be a rival God, He by all means doth away with this; and
interested Himself about this not less earnestly, but even more so,
than about His miracles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p40">But when He saith, “Neither knoweth any man the
Father, save the Son,” He means not this, that all men were
ignorant of Him, but that with the knowledge wherewith He knows<note n="1628" id="iii.XXXVIII-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p41"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XXXVIII-p41.1">ἐπσταται</span>.</p></note> Him, no man is acquainted with Him; which may be said of the Son too.<note n="1629" id="iii.XXXVIII-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p42">That is, that none but the Father has full knowledge
of Him.</p></note> For it was not of some God unknown, and revealed to no man, that He was
so speaking, as Marcion saith;<note n="1630" id="iii.XXXVIII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p43">Tertull. adv. Marc. i. 8. “The Marcionites
bring forward a new God, as if we were ashamed of the ancient
One.…I hear them talk of a new God, in the old world and in the
old age, and under that ancient God, unknown and unheard of.”
[<i>Ante-Nicene Fathers</i>, vol. iii. p. 276.] It seems to have been
common to all the Oriental sects, to speak of the Supreme God as
utterly unknown until the Christian dispensation began.</p></note>but it is the perfection of knowledge that He is here intimating, since
neither do we know the Son as He should be known; and this very thing,
to add no more, Paul was declaring, when he said, “We know in
part, and we prophesy in part.”<note n="1631" id="iii.XXXVIII-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p44"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 9" id="iii.XXXVIII-p44.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.9">1 Cor.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p45">3. Next, having brought them by His words to an earnest
desire, and having signified His unspeakable power, He after that
invites them, saying, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”<note n="1632" id="iii.XXXVIII-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 28" id="iii.XXXVIII-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|11|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.28">Matt. xi.

sins. Come, not that I may call you to account, but that I may do away
your sins; come, not that I want your honor, but that I want your
salvation. “For I,” saith He, “will give you
rest.” He said not, “I will save you,” only; but what
was much more, “I will place you in all security.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p47">“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am
meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p49">And how said He before, “The gate is

perform His words, the burden will be light; wherefore also He hath now
called it so.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p51">But how are they duly performed? If thou art become
lowly, and meek, and gentle. For this virtue is the mother of all
strictness of life. Wherefore also, when beginning those divine laws,
with this He began.<note n="1635" id="iii.XXXVIII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p52"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 3" id="iii.XXXVIII-p52.1" parsed="|Matt|5|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.3">Matt. v.

reward He appoints. “For not to another only dost thou become
serviceable; but thyself also above all thou refreshest,” saith
He. “For ye shall find rest unto your souls.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p53">Even before the things to come, He gives thee here thy
recompense, and bestows the prize already, making the saying
acceptable, both hereby, and by setting Himself forward as an example.
For, “Of what art thou afraid?” saith He, “lest thou
shouldest be a loser by thy low estate? Look to me, and to all that is
mine; learn of me, and then shalt thou know distinctly how great thy
blessing.” Seest thou how in all ways He is leading them to
humility? By His own doings: “Learn of me, for I am meek.”
By what themselves are to gain; for, “Ye shall find,” saith
He,” rest unto your souls.” By what He bestows on them;
for, “I too will refresh you,” saith He. By rendering it
light; “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” So
likewise doth Paul, saying, “For the present light affliction,
which is but for a moment, worketh a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory.”<note n="1636" id="iii.XXXVIII-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p54"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. iv. 17" id="iii.XXXVIII-p54.1" parsed="|2Cor|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.4.17">2 Cor. iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p55">And how, some one may say, is the burden light, when He
saith, “Except one hate father and mother;” and,
“Whosoever taketh not up his cross, and followeth after me, is
not worthy of me:” and, “Whosoever forsaketh not all that

the burden, the fear comes not of the nature of the thing, but of thy
remissness; since if thou art prepared, and in earnest, all will be
easy to thee and light. Since for this cause Christ also, to signify
that we too must needs labor ourselves, did not mention the gracious
things only, and then hold His peace, nor the painful things only, but
set down both. Thus He both spake of “a yoke,” and called
it “easy;” both named a burden, and added that it was
“light;” that thou shouldest neither flee from them as
toilsome, nor despise them as over easy.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p61">But if even after all this, virtue seem to thee an
irksome thing, consider that vice is more irksome. And this very thing
He was intimating, in that He said not first, “Take my yoke upon
you,” but before that, “Come, ye that labor and are heavy
laden;” implying that sin too hath labor, and a burden that is
heavy and hard to bear. For He said not only, “Ye that
labor,” but also, “that are heavy laden.” This the
prophet too was speaking of, when in that description of her nature,
“As an heavy burden they weighed heavy upon me.”<note n="1642" id="iii.XXXVIII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p62"><scripRef passage="Ps. xxxviii. 4" id="iii.XXXVIII-p62.1" parsed="|Ps|38|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.38.4">Ps.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p64">And this moreover experience itself proves. For nothing
so weighs upon the soul, and presses it down, as consciousness of sin;
nothing so much gives it wings, and raises it on high, as the
attainment of righteousness and virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p65">And mark it: what is more grievous, I pray thee, than to
have no possessions? to turn the cheek, and when smitten not to smite
again? to die by a violent death? Yet nevertheless, if we practise
self-command, all these things are light and easy, and pleasurable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p66">But be not disturbed; rather let us take up each of
these, and inquire about it accurately; and if ye will, that first
which many count most painful. Which then of the two, tell me, is
grievous and burdensome, to be in care for one belly, or to be anxious
about ten thousand? To be clothed with one outer garment, and seek for
nothing more; or having many in one’s house, to bemoan
one’s self every day and night in fear, in trembling, about the
preservation of them, grieved, and ready to choke about the loss of
them; lest one should be moth-eaten, lest a servant purloin and go off
with them?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p67">4. But whatever I may say, my speech will present no
such proof as the actual trial. Wherefore I would there were present
here with us some one of those who have attained unto that summit of
self-restraint, and then

<pb n="249" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_249.html" id="iii.XXXVIII-Page_249" />

you would
know assuredly the delight thereof; and that none of those that are
enamored of voluntary poverty would accept wealth, though ten thousand
were to offer it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p68">But would these, say you, ever consent to become poor,
and to cast away the anxieties which they have? And what of that? This
is but a proof of their madness and grievous disease, not of anything
very pleasurable in the thing. And this even themselves would testify
to us, who are daily lamenting over these their anxieties, and
accounting their life to be not worth living. But not so those others;
rather they laugh, leap for joy, and the wearers of the diadem do not
so glory, as they do in their poverty.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p69">Again, to turn the cheek is, to him that gives heed, a
less grievous thing than to smite another; for from this the contest
hath beginning, in that termination: and whereas by the former thou
hast kindled the other’s pile too, by the latter thou hast
quenched even thine own flames. But that not to be burnt is a
pleasanter thing than to be burnt, is surely plain to every man. And if
this hold in regard of bodies, much more in a soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p70">And whether is lighter, to contend, or to be crowned? to
fight, or to have the prize? and to endure waves, or to run into
harbor? Therefore also, to die is better than to live. For the one
withdraws us from waves and dangers, while the other adds unto them,
and makes a man subject to numberless plots and distresses, which have
made life not worth living in thine account.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p71">And if thou disbelievest our sayings, hearken to them
that have seen the countenances of the martyrs in the time of their
conflicts, how when scourged and flayed, they were exceeding joyful and
glad, and when exposed upon hot irons, rejoiced, and were glad of
heart, more than such as lie upon a bed of roses. Wherefore Paul also
said, when he was at the point of departing hence, and closing his life
by a violent death, “I joy, and rejoice with you all; for the
same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.”<note n="1644" id="iii.XXXVIII-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXVIII-p72"><scripRef passage="Phil. ii. 17, 18" id="iii.XXXVIII-p72.1" parsed="|Phil|2|17|2|18" osisRef="Bible:Phil.2.17-Phil.2.18">Phil. ii.
17, 18</scripRef>. [R.V., “and in
the same manner also,” etc.]</p></note> Seest thou with what exceeding strength of language he invites the
whole world to partake in his gladness? So great a good did he know his
departure hence to be, so desirable, and lovely, and worthy of prayer,
that formidable thing, death.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p73">5. But that virtue’s yoke is sweet and light, is
manifest many other ways also; but to conclude, if you please, let us
look also at the burdens of sin. Let us then bring forward the
covetous, the retailers and second-hand dealers in shameless bargains.
What now could be a heavier burden than such transactions? how many
sorrows, how many anxieties, how many disappointments, how many
dangers, how many plots and wars, daily spring up from these gains? how
many troubles and disturbances? For as one can never see the sea
without waves, so neither such a soul without anxiety, and despondency,
and fear, and disturbance; yea, the second overtakes the first, and
again others come up, and when these are not yet ceased, others come to
a head.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p74">Or wouldest thou see the souls of the revilers, and of
the passionate? Why, what is worse than this torture? what, than the
wounds they have within? what, than the furnace that is continually
burning, and the flame that is never quenched?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p75">Or of the sensual, and of such as cleave unto this
present life? Why, what more grievous than this bondage? They live the
life of Cain, dwelling in continual trembling and fear at every death
that happens; the kinsmen of the dead mourn not so much, as these do
for their own end.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p76">What again fuller of turmoil, and more frantic, than
such as are puffed up with pride? “For learn,” saith He,
“of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest
unto your souls.” Because long-suffering is the mother of all
good things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p77">Fear thou not therefore, neither start away from the
yoke that lightens thee of all these things, but put thyself under it
with all forwardness, and then thou shalt know well the pleasure
thereof. For it doth not at all bruise thy neck, but is put on thee for
good order’s sake only, and to persuade thee to walk seemly, and
to lead thee unto the royal road, and to deliver thee from the
precipices on either side, and to make thee walk with ease in the
narrow way.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXVIII-p78">Since then so great are its benefits, so great its
security, so great its gladness, let us with all our soul, with all our
diligence, draw this yoke; that we may both here “find rest unto
our souls,” and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
might, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

at once bring the law to an end, and not startle them. But there are

soothe the infirmity of the Jews. At which last He is laboring here,
putting forward as a plea the necessity of nature; although in the case
of acknowledged sins, that could not of course ever be an excuse. For
neither may the murderer make his anger a plea, nor the adulterer
allege his lust, no, nor any other excuse; but here, by mentioning
their hunger, He freed them from all blame.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p10">But do thou, I pray thee, admire the disciples, how
entirely they control themselves, and make no account of the things of

withdraw themselves. For except hunger had sorely constrained them,
they would not have done so much as this.</p>

“he gave unto him,”<note n="1656" id="iii.XXXIX-p25.4"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p26">Abimelech, <scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxi. 6" id="iii.XXXIX-p26.1" parsed="|1Sam|21|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.21.6">1 Sam. xxi. 6</scripRef>.</p></note>indicating that herein also David had much to say for himself, since
even the very priest suffered him; and not only suffered, but even
ministered unto him. For tell me not that David was a prophet, for not
even so was it lawful, but the privilege was the priests’:
wherefore also He added, “but for the priests only.” For
though he were ten thousand times a prophet, yet was he not a priest;
and though he were himself a prophet, yet not so they that were with
him; since to them too we know that he gave.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p27">“What then,” it might be said, “were
they all one with David?” Why talk to me of dignity, where there
seems to be a transgression of the law, even though it be the
constraint of nature? Yea, and in this way too He hath the more
entirely acquitted them of the charges, in that he who is greater is
found to have done the same.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p28">“And what is this to the question,” one may
say; “for it was not surely the Sabbath, that he
transgressed?” Thou tellest me of that which is greater, and
which especially shows the wisdom of Christ, that letting go the
Sabbath, He brings another example greater than the Sabbath. For it is
by no means the same, to break in upon a day, and to touch that holy
table, which it was not lawful for any man to touch. Since the Sabbath
indeed hath been violated, and that often; nay rather it is continually
being violated, both by circumcision, and by many other works; and at
Jericho<note n="1657" id="iii.XXXIX-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p29"><scripRef passage="Josh. vi. 15" id="iii.XXXIX-p29.1" parsed="|Josh|6|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Josh.6.15">Josh. vi.

So that He more than obtains the victory. How then did no man blame
David, although there was yet another ground of charge heavier than
this, that of the priests’ murder, which had its origin from
this? But He states it not, as applying himself to the present subject
only.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p30">2. Afterwards again He refutes it in another way also.
For as at first He brought in David, by the dignity of the person
quelling their pride; so when He had stopped their mouths, and had put
down their boasting, then He adds also the more appropriate refutation.
And of what sort is this? “Know ye not, that in the temple the
priests profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?”<note n="1658" id="iii.XXXIX-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 5" id="iii.XXXIX-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|12|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.5">Matt. xii.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> For in that other instance indeed, saith He, the emergency made the
relaxation, but here is the relaxation even without emergency. He did
not however at once thus refute them but first by way of permission,
afterwards as insisting upon his argument. Because it was meet to draw
the stronger inference last, although the former argument also had of
course its proper weight.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p32">For tell me not, that it is not freeing one’s self
from blame, to bring forward another who is committing the same sin.
For when the doer incurs no blame, the act on which he hath ventured
becomes a rule for others to plead.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p33">Nevertheless He was not satisfied with this, but
subjoins also what is more decisive, saying that the deed is no sin at
all; and this more than anything was the sign of a glorious victory, to
point to the law repealing itself, and in two ways doing so, first by
the place, then by the Sabbath; or rather even in three ways, in that
both the work is twofold<note n="1659" id="iii.XXXIX-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p34">As being done, 1, in the holy place; 2, on the holy
day.</p></note>that is done, and with it goes also another thing, its being done by
the priests; and what is yet more, that it is not even brought as a
charge. “For they,” saith He, “are
blameless.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p35">Seest thou how many points He hath stated? the place;
for He saith, “In the temple;” the persons, for they are
“the priests;” the time, for He saith, “the
Sabbath;” the act itself, for “they profane;” (He not
having said, “they break,” but what is more grievous,
“they profane;”) that they not only escape punishment, but
are even free from blame, “for they,” saith He, “are
blameless.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p36">Do not ye therefore account this, He saith, like the
former instance. For that indeed was done both but once, and not by a
priest, and was of necessity; wherefore also they were deserving of
excuse; but this last is both done every Sabbath, and by priests, and
in the temple, and according to the law. And therefore again not by
favor, but in a legal way, they are acquitted of the charges. For not
at all as blaming them did I so speak, saith He, nor yet as freeing
them from blame in the way of indulgence, but according to the
principle of justice.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p37">And He seems indeed to be defending them, but it is His
disciples whom He is clearing of the alleged faults. For when He saith,
“those are blameless,” He means, “much more are
these.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p38">“But they are not priests.” Nay, they are
greater than priests. For the Lord of the temple Himself is here: the
truth, not the type. Wherefore He said also,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p39">“But I say unto you, That in this place is one
greater than the temple.”<note n="1660" id="iii.XXXIX-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 6" id="iii.XXXIX-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|12|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.6">Matt. xii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p41">Nevertheless, great as the sayings were which they
heard, they made no reply, for the salvation of men was not their
object.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p42">Then, because to the hearers it would seem harsh, He
quickly draws a veil over it, giving His discourse, as before, a
lenient turn, yet even so expressing Himself with a rebuke. “But
if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have<note n="1661" id="iii.XXXIX-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p43">[R.V. “desire.”]</p></note>mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p45">Seest thou how again He inclines His speech to lenity,
yet again shows them to be out of the reach of lenity? “For ye
would not have condemned,” saith He, “the guiltless.”
Before indeed He inferred the same from what is said of the priests, in
the words, “they are guiltless;” but here He states it on
His own authority; or rather, this too is out of the law, for He was
quoting a prophetic saying.<note n="1663" id="iii.XXXIX-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p46"><scripRef passage="Hosea vi. 6" id="iii.XXXIX-p46.1" parsed="|Hos|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.6.6">Hosea vi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p47">3. After this He mentions another reason likewise;
“For the Son of man,” saith He, “is Lord of the
Sabbath day;”<note n="1664" id="iii.XXXIX-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p48"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 8" id="iii.XXXIX-p48.1" parsed="|Matt|12|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.8">Matt. xii.

common nature also; for He said, “The Sabbath was made for man,
not man for the Sabbath.”<note n="1665" id="iii.XXXIX-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p49"><scripRef passage="Mark ii. 27" id="iii.XXXIX-p49.1" parsed="|Mark|2|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.2.27">Mark ii.

course they would scarcely be observed afterwards.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p52">For indeed the Sabbath did at the first confer many and
great benefits; for instance, it made them gentle towards those of
their household, and humane; it taught them God’s providence and
the creation, as Ezekiel saith;<note n="1667" id="iii.XXXIX-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p53"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xx. 12" id="iii.XXXIX-p53.1" parsed="|Ezek|20|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.20.12">Ezek. xx.

them to regard the things of the Spirit.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p54">For because they could not have borne it,<note n="1668" id="iii.XXXIX-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p55">The meaning seems to be, it would have been too hard
a trial of their religious discretion.</p></note>if when He was giving the law for the Sabbath, He had said, “Do
your good works on the Sabbath, but do not the works which are
evil,” therefore He restrained them from all alike for, “Ye
must do nothing at all,” saith He: and not even so were they kept
in order. But He Himself, in the very act of giving the law of the
Sabbath, did even therein darkly signify that He will have them refrain
from the evil works only, by the saying, “Ye must do no work,
except what shall be done for your life.”<note n="1669" id="iii.XXXIX-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p56"><scripRef passage="Exod. xii. 16" id="iii.XXXIX-p56.1" parsed="|Exod|12|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.12.16">Exod. xii.

truth.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p58">Did Christ then, it will be said, repeal a thing so
highly profitable? Far from it; nay, He greatly enhanced it. For it was
time for them to be trained in all things by the higher rules, and it
was unnecessary that his hands should be bound, who was freed from
wickedness, winged for all good works; or that men should hereby learn
that God made all things; or that they should so be made gentle, who
are called to imitate God’s own love to mankind (for He saith,
“Be ye merciful, as your Heavenly Father”);<note n="1671" id="iii.XXXIX-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p59"><scripRef passage="Luke vi. 36" id="iii.XXXIX-p59.1" parsed="|Luke|6|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.36">Luke vi.

a feast all their life long; (“For let us keep the feast,”
it is said, “not with old leaven, neither with leaven of malice
and wickedness; but with unleavened bread of sincerity and
truth”);<note n="1672" id="iii.XXXIX-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p60"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. v. 8" id="iii.XXXIX-p60.1" parsed="|1Cor|5|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.5.8">1 Cor. v.

very Lord of all for their inmate, and in all things hold communion
with Him; by prayer, and by oblation, and by scriptures, and by
almsgiving, and by having Him within them. Lo now, why is any Sabbath
required, by him who is always keeping the feast, whose conversation is
in Heaven?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p61">4. Let us keep the feast then continually, and do no
evil thing; for this is a feast: and let our spiritual things be made
intense, while our earthly things give place: and let us rest a
spiritual rest, refraining our hands from covetousness; withdrawing our
body from our superfluous and unprofitable toils, from such as the
people of the Hebrews did of old endure in Egypt. For there is no
difference betwixt us who are gathering gold, and those that were bound
in the mire, working at those bricks, and gathering stubble, and being
beaten. Yea, for now too the devil bids us make bricks, as Pharaoh did
then. For what else is gold, than mire? and what else is silver, than
stubble? Like stubble, at least, it kindles the flame of desire; like
mire, so doth gold defile him that possesses it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p62">Wherefore He sent us, not Moses from the wilderness, but
His Son from Heaven. If then, after He is come, thou abide in Egypt,
thou wilt suffer with the Egyptians: but if leaving that land thou go
up with the spiritual Israel, thou shalt see all the miracles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p63">Yet not even this suffices for salvation. For we must
not only be delivered out of Egypt, but we must also enter into the
promise. Since the Jews too, as Paul saith, both went through the Red
Sea,<note n="1673" id="iii.XXXIX-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p64"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 1" id="iii.XXXIX-p64.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.1">1 Cor. x.

and drank spiritual
drink, but nevertheless they all perished.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p65">Lest then the same befall us also, let us not be slow,
neither draw back; but when thou hearest wicked spies even now bringing
up an evil report against the strait and narrow way, and uttering the
same kind of talk as those spies of old, let not the multitude, but
Joshua, be our pattern, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh; and do not thou
give up, until thou have attained the promise, and entered into the
Heavens.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p66">Neither account the journey to be difficult. “For
if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, much more, being
reconciled, shall we be saved.”<note n="1674" id="iii.XXXIX-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XXXIX-p67"><scripRef passage="Rom. v. 10" id="iii.XXXIX-p67.1" parsed="|Rom|5|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.10">Rom. v.

narrow.” Well, but the former, through which thou hast come, is
not strait and narrow only, but even impassable, and full of savage
wild beasts. And as there was no passing through the Red Sea, unless
that miracle had been wrought, so neither could we, abiding in our
former life, have gone up into Heaven, but only by baptism intervening.
Now if the impossible hath become possible, much more will the
difficult be easy.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p68">“But that,” it will be said, “was of
grace only.” Why, for this reason especially thou hast just cause
to take courage. For if, where it was grace alone, He wrought with you;
will He not much more be your aid, where ye also show forth laborious
works? If He saved thee, doing nothing, will He not much more help
thee, working?</p>

take courage about the difficulties also; but now I add this, that if
we are vigilant, these will not be so much as difficult. For mark it:
death is trodden under foot, the devil hath fallen, the law of sin is
extinguished, the grace of the Spirit is given, life is contracted into
a small space, the heavy burdens are abridged.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p71">And to convince thee hereof by the actual results, see
how many have overshot the injunctions of Christ; and art thou afraid
of that which is just their measure? What plea then wilt thou have,
when others are leaping beyond the bounds, and thou thyself too
slothful for what is enacted?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p72">Thus, thee we admonish to give alms of such things as
thou hast, but another hath even stripped himself of all his
possessions: thee we require to live chastely with thy wife, but
another hath not so much as entered into marriage: and thee we entreat
not to be envious, but another we find giving up even his own life for
charity: thee again we entreat to be lenient in judgments, and not
severe to them that sin, but another, even when smitten, hath turned
the other cheek also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p73">What then shall we say, I pray thee? What excuse shall
we make, not doing even these things, when others go so far beyond us?
And they would not have gone beyond us, had not the thing been very
easy. For which pines away, he who envies other men’s blessings,
or he who takes pleasure with them, and rejoices? Which eyes all things
with suspicion and continual trembling, the chaste man, or the
adulterer? Which is cheered by good hopes, he that spoils by violence,
or he that shows mercy, and imparts of his own to the needy?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XXXIX-p74">Let us then bear in mind these things, and not be torpid
in our career for virtue’s sake; but having stripped ourselves
with all readiness for these glorious wrestlings, let us labor for a
little while, that we may win the perpetual and imperishable crowns;
unto which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever.

day, vindicating what had been done by His disciples. And the other
evangelists indeed say, that He “set” the man “in the
midst,” and asked them, “If it was lawful to do good on the
Sabbath days.”<note n="1676" id="iii.XL-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p5">See <scripRef passage="Mark 3.3,4; Luke 6.8,9" id="iii.XL-p5.1" parsed="|Mark|3|3|3|4;|Luke|6|8|6|9" osisRef="Bible:Mark.3.3-Mark.3.4 Bible:Luke.6.8-Luke.6.9">Mark iii. 3, 4, and Luke vi. 8, 9</scripRef>.</p></note>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p6">See the tender bowels of the Lord. “He set him in
the midst,” that by the sight He might subdue them; that overcome
by the spectacle they might cast away their wickedness, and out of a
kind of shame towards the man, cease from their savage ways. But they,
ungentle and inhuman, choose rather to hurt the fame of Christ, than to
see this person made whole: in both ways betraying their wickedness; by
their warring against Christ, and by their doing so with such
contentiousness, as even to treat with despite His mercies to other
men.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p7">And while the other evangelists say, He asked the
question, this one saith, it was asked of Him. “And they asked
Him,” so it stands, “saying, Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath days? that they might accuse Him.”<note n="1677" id="iii.XL-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p8"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 10" id="iii.XL-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|12|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.10">Matt. xii.
10</scripRef>.</p></note> And it is likely that both took place. For being unholy wretches, and
well assured that He would doubtless proceed to the healing, they
hastened to take Him beforehand with their question, thinking in this
way to hinder Him. And this is why they asked, “Is it lawful to
heal on the Sabbath days?” not for information, but that
“they might accuse Him.” Yet surely the work was enough, if
it were really their wish to accuse Him; but they desired to find a
handle in His words too, preparing for themselves beforehand an
abundance of arguments.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p9">But He in His love towards man doth this also: He
answers them, teaching His own meekness, and turning it all back upon
them; and points out their inhumanity. And He “setteth” the
man “in the midst;” not in fear of them, but endeavoring to
profit them, and move them to pity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p10">But when not even so did He prevail with them, then was
He grieved, it is said, and wroth with them for the hardness of their
heart, and He saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p11">“What man is there among you that shall have one

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p15">Thus, lest they have ground of obstinacy, and of
accusing him again of transgression, He convicts them by this example.
And do thou mark, I pray thee, how variously and suitably in each case,
He introduces His pleas for the breaking of the sabbath. Thus, first,
in the case of the blind man,<note n="1681" id="iii.XL-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p16"><scripRef passage="John ix. 6" id="iii.XL-p16.1" parsed="|John|9|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.6">John ix.

“If a man on the Sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law
should not be broken;” (and He said not “that a man should
be profited”); “are ye angry at me, because I have made a

up with it, rather than with love of mankind. And indeed the other
evangelist saith,<note n="1688" id="iii.XL-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p25"><scripRef passage="Mark iii. 5; Luke vi. 10" id="iii.XL-p25.1" parsed="|Mark|3|5|0|0;|Luke|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.3.5 Bible:Luke.6.10">Mark iii.

by His very eye He might win them over; but not even so did they become
better.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p26">And yet here He speaks only; whereas elsewhere in many
cases He heals by laying on of hands also. But nevertheless none of
these things made them meek; rather, while the man was healed, they by
his health became worse.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p27">For His desire indeed was to cure them before him, and
He tried innumerable ways of healing, both by what He did in their
presence, and by what He said: but since their malady after all was
incurable, He proceeded to the work. “Then saith He to the man,
Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth, and it was
restored whole, like as the other.”<note n="1689" id="iii.XL-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 13" id="iii.XL-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|12|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.13">Matt. xii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p29">2. What then did they? They go forth, it is said, and
take counsel together to slay Him. For “the Pharisees,”
saith the Scripture, “went out and held a council against Him,
how they might destroy Him.”<note n="1690" id="iii.XL-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 14" id="iii.XL-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.14">Matt. xii.

counsel,” etc.]</p></note> They had received no injury, yet they went about to slay Him. So great
an evil is envy. For not against strangers only, but even against our
own, is it ever warring. And Mark saith, they took this counsel with
the Herodians.<note n="1691" id="iii.XL-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p31"><scripRef passage="Mark iii. 6" id="iii.XL-p31.1" parsed="|Mark|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.3.6">Mark iii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p32">What then doth the gentle and meek One? He withdrew, on
being aware of it. “But when Jesus knew their devices,<note n="1692" id="iii.XL-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p33">[“Their devices” is borrowed from <scripRef passage="Matt. 12.25" id="iii.XL-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|12|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.25">verse 25</scripRef>, where the Greek phrase occurs
(“their thoughts,” A.V.)—R.]</p></note> He withdrew Himself,” it is said, “from them.”<note n="1693" id="iii.XL-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 15" id="iii.XL-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.15">Matt. xii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> Where now are they who say, miracles ought to be done? Nay, by these
things He signified, that the uncandid soul is not even thereby
persuaded; and He made it plain that His disciples too were blamed by
them without cause. This however we should observe, that they grow
fierce especially at the benefits done to their neighbors; and when
they see any one delivered either from disease or from wickedness, then
is the time for them to find fault, and become wild beasts. Thus did
they calumniate Him, both when He was about to save the harlot, and
when He was eating with publicans, and now again, when they saw the
hand restored.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p35">But do thou observe, I pray thee, how He neither desists
from His tender care over the infirm, and yet allays their envy.
“And great multitudes<note n="1694" id="iii.XL-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p36">[So Chrysostom, with the received text. Comp.
R.V.—R.]</p></note>followed Him, and He healed them all; and He charged them that were
healed, that they should make Him known to no man.”<note n="1695" id="iii.XL-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 15, 16" id="iii.XL-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|12|15|12|16" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.15-Matt.12.16">Matt. xii.
15, 16</scripRef>. [“To no
man,” peculiar to Chrysostom.—R.]</p></note> Because, while the multitudes everywhere both admire and follow Him,
they desist not from their wickedness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p38">Then, lest thou shouldest be confounded at what is going
on, and at their strange frenzy, He introduces the prophet also,
foretelling all this. For so great was the accuracy of the prophets,
that they omit not even these things, but foretell His very
journeyings, and changes of place, and the intent with which He acted
therein; that thou mightest learn, how they spake all by the Spirit.
For if the secrets of men cannot by any art be known, much more were it
impossible to learn Christ’s purpose, except the Spirit revealed
it.<note n="1696" id="iii.XL-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p39">Cf. <scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 11" id="iii.XL-p39.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.11">1 Cor.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p40">What then saith the prophet? Nay, it is subjoined:
“That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
Prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in
whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He
shall show judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry,<note n="1697" id="iii.XL-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p41">[R.V., “cry aloud.”]</p></note>neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed
shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He send
forth judgment unto victory. And in His name shall the Gentiles
trust.”<note n="1698" id="iii.XL-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. 12.17-21; Isa. 42.1-4" id="iii.XL-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|12|17|12|21;|Isa|42|1|42|4" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.17-Matt.12.21 Bible:Isa.42.1-Isa.42.4">Matt. xii. 17–21; see Isa. xlii.
1–4</scripRef>. [ R.V.,
“hope” for “trust.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p43">The prophet celebrates His meekness, and His unspeakable
power, and opens to the Gentiles “a great door and
effectual;” he foretells also the ills that are to overtake the
Jews, and signifies His unanimity with the Father. For
“behold,” saith He, “my servant, whom I have chosen,
my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.” Now if He chose
Him, not as an adversary doth Christ set aside the law, nor as being an
enemy of the lawgiver, but as having the same mind with Him, and the
same objects.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p44">Then proclaiming His meekness, he saith, “He shall
not strive nor cry.” For His desire indeed was to heal in their
presence; but since they thrust Him away, not even against this did He
contend.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p45">And intimating both His might, and their weakness, he
saith, “A bruised reed shall He not break.” For indeed it
was easy to break them all to pieces like a reed, and not a reed
merely, but one already bruised.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p46">“And smoking flax shall He not quench.” Here
he sets forth both their anger that is kindled, and His might that is
able to put

<pb n="256" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_256.html" id="iii.XL-Page_256" />

down their anger, and
to quench it with all ease; whereby His great mildness is
signified.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p47">What then? Shall these things always be? And will He
endure them perpetually, forming such frantic plots against Him? Far
from it; but when He hath performed His part, then shall He execute the
other purposes also. For this He declared by saying “Till He send
forth judgment unto victory: and in His name shall the Gentiles
trust.” As Paul likewise saith, “Having in a readiness to
revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.”<note n="1699" id="iii.XL-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p48"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. x. 6" id="iii.XL-p48.1" parsed="|2Cor|10|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.10.6">2 Cor. x.
6</scripRef>. [R.V., “being in
readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be
fulfilled.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p49">But what is, “when He sends forth judgment unto
victory?” When He hath fulfilled all His own part, then, we are
told, He will bring down upon them His vengeance also, and that a
perfect vengeance. Then shall they suffer His terrors, when His trophy
is gloriously set up, and the ordinances that proceed from Him have
prevailed, and He hath left them no plea of contradiction, however
shameless. For He is wont to call righteousness,
“judgment.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p50">But not to this will His dispensation be confined, to
the punishment of unbelievers only, but He will also win to Himself the
whole world. Wherefore He added, “And in His name shall the
Gentiles trust.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p51">Then, to inform thee that this too is according to the
purpose of the Father, in the beginning the prophet had assured us of
this likewise, together with what had gone before; saying, “My
well-beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.” For of the
well-beloved it is quite evident that He did these things also
according to the mind of the beloved.<note n="1700" id="iii.XL-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p52"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XL-p52.1">ὁ γαπητ</span>—<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XL-p52.2">το

<p id="iii.XL-p53">3. “Then they brought unto Him one possessed with a devil,
blind and dumb, and He healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
both spake and saw.”<note n="1701" id="iii.XL-p53.1"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 22" id="iii.XL-p53.2" parsed="|Matt|12|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.22">Matt. xii. 22</scripRef>. [“Then was brought”
(A. V. and R. V.), but the other form occurs in the Homily. R. V. omits
“both.”—R.]</note></p>

<p id="iii.XL-p54">O wickedness of the evil spirit! he had barred up both
entrances, whereby that person should have believed, as well sight as hearing;
nevertheless, both did Christ open.</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p55">“And all the people were amazed, saying, Is not this
the Son of David?<note n="1702" id="iii.XL-p55.1">[R. V., “Is this the Son of David?”]</note>
But the Pharisees said, This fellow doth<note n="1703" id="iii.XL-p55.2">[R. V., “this man.”]</note>
not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.”<note n="1704" id="iii.XL-p55.3"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 23, 24" id="iii.XL-p55.4" parsed="|Matt|12|23|12|24" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.23-Matt.12.24">Matt. xii. 23, 24</scripRef>.</note></p>

<p id="iii.XL-p56">And yet what great thing had been said? Nevertheless, not even this did they
endure: to such a degree, as I
have already remarked, are they ever stung by the good works done to their neighbors,
and nothing grieves them so much as the salvation of men. And yet He had actually retired, and
had given room for their passion to subside; but the evil was again rekindled,
because a benefit was again conferred; and the evil spirit was not so indignant
as they. For he indeed departed
from the body, and gave place and fled away, uttering no sound; but these were
endeavoring now to slay, now to defame Him.
That is, their first aim not succeeding, they would fain
hurt His good name.</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p57">Such a thing is envy, than which no worse evil can
exist. For the adulterer indeed
enjoys some pleasure, such as it is, and in a short time accomplishes his
proper sin; but the envious man punishes himself, and takes vengeance upon
himself more than on the person whom he envies, and never ceases from his sin,
but is continually engaged in the commission thereof.
For as a sow in mire, and evil spirits in our hurt, so also
doth he delight in his neighbor’s ills; and if anything painful take place,
then is he refreshed, and takes breath; accounting the calamities of others his
own joys, and the blessings of others his own ills; and he considers not what
pleasure may accrue to himself, but what pain to his neighbor. These men therefore were it not meet to
stone and beat to death, like mad dogs, like destroying demons, like the very
furies?</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p58">For as beetles feed on dung, so do these men on the
calamities of others, being a sort of common foes and enemies of our
nature. And whereas the rest of
mankind pity even a brute when it is killed, dost thou, on seeing a man receive
benefits, become like a wild beast, tremble, and turn pale? Why, what can be worse than this
madness? Therefore, you see,
whoremongers and publicans were able to enter into the kingdom, but the
envious, being within it, went out:
For “the children of the kingdom,” it is said, 
“shall be cast out.”<note n="1705" id="iii.XL-p58.1"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 12" id="iii.XL-p58.2" parsed="|Matt|8|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.12">Matt. viii. 12</scripRef>.</note>
And the former, once freed from their
present wickedness, attained to things which they never looked for, while these
latter lost even the good things which they had; and very reasonably. For this turns a man into a devil, this
renders one a savage demon. Thus
did the first murder arise; thus was nature forgotten; thus the earth defiled;
thus afterwards did it open its mouth, to receive yet living, and utterly
destroy, Dathan, and Korah, and Abiram, and all that multitude.<note n="1706" id="iii.XL-p58.3"><scripRef passage="Numb. xvi." id="iii.XL-p58.4" parsed="|Num|16|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Num.16">Numb. xvi.</scripRef></note></p>
<pb n="262" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_262.html" id="iii.XL-Page_262" />

<p id="iii.XL-p59">4. But to declaim against envy, one may say, is easy; but we ought 
to consider also how men are to be freed from the disease.  How then 
are we to be rid of this wickedness?  If we bear in mind, that as he 
who hath committed fornication cannot lawfully enter the church, so 
neither he that envies; nay, and much less the latter than the 
former.  For as things are, it is accounted even an indifferent 
thing; wherefore also it is little thought of; but if its real 
badness be made evident, we should easily refrain from it.</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p60">Weep then, and groan; lament, and entreat God. Learn to feel and 
to repent for it, as for a grievous sin. And if thou be
of this mind, thou wilt quickly be rid of the disease.</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p61">And who knows not, one may say, that envy is an evil thing? No one 
indeed is ignorant of it: yet they have not the same estimation of 
this passion as of adultery and fornication. When, at least, did any one condemn
himself bitterly for having envied? when did he entreat God 
concerning this pest, that He would be merciful to him?  No man at 
any time: but if he shall fast and give a little money to a poor man, 
though he be envious to the thousandth degree, he counts himself to 
have done nothing horrid, held as he is in subjection by the most 
accursed passion of all. Whence, for example, did Cain become such as 
he was? Whence Esau? Whence the children of Laban? Whence the sons of 
Jacob? Whence Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company? Whence 
Miriam? Whence Aaron?  Whence the devil himself?</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p62">Herewith consider this also; that thou injurest not
him whom thou enviest, but into thyself thou art thrusting the sword. For wherein did Cain injure Abel? Did he not even against his own will
send him the more quickly into the kingdom? but himself he pierced through with
innumerable evils. Wherein did
Esau harm Jacob? Did not Jacob
grow wealthy, and enjoy unnumbered blessings; while he himself both became an
outcast from his father’s house, and wandered in a strange land, after that
plot of his?<note n="1707" id="iii.XL-p62.1"><scripRef passage="Gen. xxvii. 41" id="iii.XL-p62.2" parsed="|Gen|27|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.27.41">Gen. xxvii. 41</scripRef>.</note>
And wherein did Jacob’s sons again make
Joseph the worse, and this, though they proceeded even unto blood? had not they
to endure famine, and encounter peril to the utmost, whereas he became king of
all Egypt? For the more thou enviest,
the more dost thou become a procurer of greater blessing to the object of thine
envy. For there is a God who
beholds these things; and when He sees him injured, that doeth no injury, him
He exalts the more, and so makes him glorious, but thee He punishes.</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p63">For if them that exult over their enemies, He suffer
not to go unpunished (“For rejoice not,” it is said, “when thine enemies fall,
lest at any time the Lord see it, and it displease Him”<note n="1708" id="iii.XL-p63.1"><scripRef passage="Prov. xxiv. 17, 18" id="iii.XL-p63.2" parsed="|Prov|24|17|24|18" osisRef="Bible:Prov.24.17-Prov.24.18">Prov. xxiv. 17, 18</scripRef>.</note>);
much more such as envy those who have done no wrong.</p>

<p id="iii.XL-p64">Let us then extirpate the many-headed wild beast. For in truth many are the kinds of
envy. Thus, if he that loves one
that is a friend to him hath no more than the publican,<note n="1709" id="iii.XL-p64.1"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 46" id="iii.XL-p64.2" parsed="|Matt|5|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.46">Matt. v. 46</scripRef>.</note>
where shall he stand who hates him that doeth him no wrong? and how shall he
escape hell,<note n="1710" id="iii.XL-p64.3">[γέενναν.]</note>
becoming worse than the heathens? Wherefore also I do exceedingly
grieve, that we who are commanded to copy the angels, or rather the
Lord of the angels, emulate the devil. For indeed there is much envy,
even in the church; and more among us, than among those under
authority. Wherefore we must even discourse unto ourselves.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p65">5. Tell me then, why dost thou envy thy neighbor?
Because thou seest him reaping honor, and words of good report? Then
dost thou not bear in mind how much evil honors bring on the unguarded?
lifting them up to pride, to vainglory, to arrogance, to
contemptuousness; making them more careless? and besides these evils,
they wither also lightly away. For the most grievous thing is this,
that the evils arising therefrom abide immortal, but the pleasure at
the moment of its appearing, is flown away. For these things then dost
thou envy? tell me.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p66">“But he hath great influence with the Ruler, and
leads and drives all things which way he will, and inflicts pain on
them that offend him, and benefits his flatterers, and hath much
power.” These are the sayings of secular persons, and of men that
are riveted to the earth. For the spiritual man nothing shall be able
to hurt.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p67">For what serious harm shall he do to him? vote him out
of his office? And what of that? For if it be justly done, he is even
profited; for nothing so provokes God, as for one to hold the
priest’s office unworthily. But if unjustly, the blame again
falls on the other, not on him; for he who hath suffered anything
unjustly, and borne it nobly, obtains in this way the greater
confidence towards God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p68">Let us not then aim at this, how we may be in places of
power, and honor, and authority, but that we may live in virtue and
self denial. For indeed places of authority persuade men to do many
things which are

<pb n="257" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_257.html" id="iii.XL-Page_257" />

not approved of
God; and great vigor of soul is needed, in order to use authority
aright. For as he that is deprived thereof, practises self restraint,
whether with or against his will, so he that enjoys it is in some such
condition, as if any one living with a graceful and beautiful damsel
were to receive rules never to look upon her unchastely. For authority
is that kind of thing. Wherefore many, even against their will, hath it
induced to show insolence; it awakens wrath, and removes the bridle
from the tongue, and tears off the door of the lips; fanning the soul
as with a wind, and sinking the bark in the lowest depth of evils. Him
then who is in so great danger dost thou admire, and sayest thou he is
to be envied? Nay, how great madness is here! Consider, at any rate
(besides what we have mentioned), how many enemies and accusers, and
how many flatterers this person hath besieging him. Are these then, I
pray thee, reasons for calling a man happy? Nay, who can say so?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p69">“But the people,” you say, “hold high
account of him.” And what is this? For the people surely is not
God, to whom he is to render account: so that in naming the people,
thou art speaking of nothing else than of other breakers, and rocks,
and shoals, and sunken ridges. For to be in favor with the people, the
more it makes a man illustrious, the greater the dangers, the cares,
the despondencies it brings with it. For such an one has no power at
all to take breath or stand still, having so severe a master. And why
say I, “stand still and take breath”? Though such an one
have never so many good works, hardly doth he enter into the kingdom.
For nothing is so wont to overthrow<note n="1701" id="iii.XL-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p70"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XL-p70.1">ἐκτραχηλιζειν</span>
.</p></note>men, as the honor which comes of the multitude, making them cowardly,
ignoble, flatterers, hypocrites.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p71">Why, for instance, did the Pharisees say that Christ was
possessed? Was it not because they were greedy of the honor of the
multitude?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p72">And whence did the multitude pass the right judgment on
Him? Was it not because this disease had no hold on them? For nothing,
nothing so much tends to make men lawless and foolish, as gaping after
the honor of the multitude. Nothing makes them glorious and immoveable,
like despising the same.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p73">Wherefore also great vigor of soul is needed for him who
is to hold out against such an impulse, and so violent a blast. For as
when things are prosperous, he prefers himself to all, so when he
undergoes the contrary, he would fain bury himself alive: and this is
to him both hell, and the kingdom, when he hath come to be overwhelmed
by this passion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p74">Is all this then, I pray thee, matter of envyings, and
not rather of lamentations and tears? Every one surely can see. But
thou doest the same, in envying one in that kind of credit, as if a
person, seeing another bound and scourged and torn by innumerable wild
beasts, were to envy him his wounds and stripes. For in fact, as many
men as the multitude comprises, so many bonds also, so many tyrants
hath he: and, what is yet more grievous, each of these hath a different
mind: and they all judge whatever comes into their heads concerning him
that is a slave to them, without examining into anything; but whatever
is the decision of this or that person, this they also confirm.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p75">What manner of waves then, what tempest so grievous as
this? Yea, such a one is both puffed up in a moment by the pleasure,
and is under water again easily, being ever in fluctuation, in
tranquillity never. Thus, before the time of the assembly, and of the
contests in speaking, he is possessed with anxiety and fear; but after
the assembly he is either dead with despondency, or rejoices on the
contrary without measure; a worse thing than sorrow. For that pleasure
is not a less evil than sorrow is plain from the effect it has on the
soul; how light it makes it, and unsteady, and fluttering.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p76">And this one may see even from those of former times.
When, for instance, was David to be admired; when he rejoiced, or when
he was in anguish? When, the people of the Jews? groaning and calling
upon God, or exulting in the wilderness, and worshipping the calf?
Wherefore Solomon too, who best of all men knew what pleasure is,
saith, “It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the
house of laughter.”<note n="1702" id="iii.XL-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p77"><scripRef passage="Eccles. vii. 2" id="iii.XL-p77.1" parsed="|Eccl|7|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.7.2">Eccles.
vii. 2</scripRef>.</p></note> Wherefore Christ also blesses the one, saying, “Blessed are they
that mourn,”<note n="1703" id="iii.XL-p77.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p78"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 4" id="iii.XL-p78.1" parsed="|Matt|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.4">Matt. v.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>but the other sort He bewails, saying, “Woe unto you that laugh,
for ye shall weep.”<note n="1704" id="iii.XL-p78.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XL-p79"><scripRef passage="Luke vi. 25" id="iii.XL-p79.1" parsed="|Luke|6|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.25">Luke vi.
25</scripRef>.</p></note> And very fitly. For in delight the soul is more relaxed and effeminate,
but in mourning it is braced up, and grows sober, and is delivered from
the whole swarm of passions, and becomes higher and stronger.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XL-p80">Knowing then all these things, let us shun the glory
that comes from the multitude, and the pleasure that springs therefrom,
that we may win the real and everlasting glory; unto which may we all
attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and might, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.XLI-p3">“And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto
them, Every kingdom divided against itself shall be brought to
desolation; and every city or house divided against itself, shall not
stand: and if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how
shall then his kingdom stand?”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XLI-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XLI-p4.1">Even</span> before now they had
accused Him of this, that “by Beelzebub He casteth out the
devils.”<note n="1705" id="iii.XLI-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p5"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 34" id="iii.XLI-p5.1" parsed="|Matt|9|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.34">Matt. ix.
34</scripRef>. [“Demons,”
and so throughout.—R.]</p></note> But whereas then He did not rebuke them, allowing them both to know His
power by His more numerous miracles, and by His teaching to learn His
majesty: now, since they continued saying the same, He proceeds also to
rebuke them, showing His Godhead by this first, that He made their
secrets public; and secondly, by the very act of casting out the devils
with ease.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p6">And indeed the accusation too was very shameless.
Because, as I have said, envy seeks not what to say, but only that it
may say somewhat. Yet for all that, not even so did Christ despise
them, but defends Himself with the forbearance proper to Him, teaching
us to be meek to our enemies; and though they say such things, as we
are neither conscious of, nor have they any the least probability, not
to be disturbed, nor troubled, but with all long suffering to render
them an account. This then He did most especially on that very
occasion, affording the strongest proof, that the things were false
that were said by them. For neither was it a demoniac’s part to
exhibit so much meekness; it was not a demoniac’s part to know
men’s secrets.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p7">For, in truth, both because of the exceeding impudence
of such a suspicion, and because of the fear of the multitude, they
durst not publicly make these charges, but were turning them in their
mind. But He, to show them that He knew all that likewise, doth not set
down the accusation, nor doth He expose their wickedness; but the
refutation He adds, leaving it to the conscience of them that had said
it to convict them. For on one thing only was He bent, to do good to
them that were sinning, not to expose them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p8">Yet surely, if He had been minded to extend his speech
in length, and to make them ridiculous, and withal to have exacted of
them also the most extreme penalty, there was nothing to hinder Him.
Nevertheless He put aside all these things, and looked to one object
only, not to render them more contentious, but more candid, and so to
dispose them better toward amendment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p9">How then doth He plead with them? Not by allegation out
of the Scriptures (for they would not so much as attend, but were sure
rather to distort their meaning), but by the events of ordinary life.
For “every kingdom,” saith He, “divided against
itself shall not stand; and a city and a house, if it be divided, is
soon dissolved.”<note n="1706" id="iii.XLI-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p10">[Comp. ver
se 25.]</p></note></p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p11">For the wars from without are not so ruinous as the
civil ones. Yea, and this is the case in bodies too; it is the case
even in all things; but for this time He takes His illustration from
those that are more publicly known.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p12">And yet, what is there more powerful on earth than a
kingdom? Nothing, but nevertheless it perishes if in dissension. And if
in that case one throw the blame on the great burden of the affairs
thereof, as breaking down by its own weight; what wouldest thou say of
a city? and what of a house? Thus, whether it be a small thing, or a
great, if at dissension with itself, it perishes. If then I, having a
devil, do by him cast out the devils, there is dissension and fighting
among devils, and they take their stand one against another. But if
they stand one against another, their strength is wasted and destroyed.
“For if Satan cast out Satan” (and He said not “the
devils,” implying their great unanimity one with another),
“he is then divided against himself;” so He speaks. But if
he be divided, he is become weaker, and is ruined; and if he be ruined,
how can he cast out another?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p13">Seest thou how great the absurdity of the accusation,
how great the folly, the inconsistency? Since it is not for the same
persons to say first, that He stands, and casts out devils, and then to
say, that He stands by

<pb n="259" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_259.html" id="iii.XLI-Page_259" />

that, which
it was likely would be the cause of His undoing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p14">2. This then being the first refutation, the next after
it is that which relates to the disciples. For not always in one way
only, but also in a second and third, He solves their objections, being
minded most abundantly to silence their shamelessness. Which sort of
thing He did also with respect to the Sabbath, bringing forward David,
the priests, the testimony that saith, “I will have mercy, and
not sacrifice,” the cause of the Sabbath, for which it was
ordained; “for the Sabbath,” saith He,” was for
man.”<note n="1707" id="iii.XLI-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p15">See <scripRef passage="Matt. 12.3,5,7; Mark 2.27" id="iii.XLI-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|12|3|0|0;|Matt|12|5|0|0;|Matt|12|7|0|0;|Mark|2|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.3 Bible:Matt.12.5 Bible:Matt.12.7 Bible:Mark.2.27">Matt. xii. 3, 5, 7, and Mark ii. 27</scripRef>.</p></note> This then He doth in the present case also: where after the first He
proceeds to a second refutation, plainer than the former.
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p16">“For if I,” saith He, “by Beelzebub
cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out?”<note n="1708" id="iii.XLI-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p17"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 27" id="iii.XLI-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|12|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.27">Matt. xii.
27</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p18">See here too His gentleness. For He said not, “my
disciples,” nor, “the apostles,” but “your
sons;” to the end that if indeed they were minded to return to
the same nobleness<note n="1709" id="iii.XLI-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p19"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLI-p19.1">εγνειαν</span>,
“hereditary good feeling.” [Comp. <scripRef passage="Acts xvii. 11" id="iii.XLI-p19.2" parsed="|Acts|17|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.17.11">Acts xvii. 11</scripRef>.]</p></note>with them, they might derive hence a powerful spring that way; but if
they were uncandid, and continued in the same course, they might not
thenceforth be able to allege any plea, though ever so shameless.
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p20">But what He saith is like this, “By whom do the
apostles cast them out?” For in fact they were doing so already,
because they had received authority from Him, and these men brought no
charge against them; their quarrel not being with the acts, but with
the person only. As then it was His will to show that their sayings
arose only from their envy against Him, He brings forward the apostles;
thus: If I so cast them out, much more those, who have received their
authority from me. Nevertheless, no such thing have ye said to them.
How then bring ye these charges against me, the author of their doings,
while acquitting them of the accusations? This, however, will not free
you from your punishment, rather it will condemn you the more.
Therefore also He added, “They shall be your judges.” For
when persons from among you, and having been practised in these things,
both believe me and obey, it is most clear that they will also condemn
those who are against me both in deed and word.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p21">“But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God,
then the Kingdom of God is come unto you.”<note n="1710" id="iii.XLI-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 28" id="iii.XLI-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|12|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.28">Matt. xii.
28</scripRef>. [R.V., “upon
you.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p23">What means “the Kingdom”? “My
coming.” See how again He conciliates and soothes them, and draws
them to the knowledge of Himself, and signifies that they are warring
with their own good, and contentious against their own salvation.
“For whereas ye ought to rejoice,” saith He, “and
leap for joy, that One is come bestowing those great and unutterable
blessings, hymned of old by the prophets, and that the time of your
prosperity is at hand; ye do the contrary; so far from receiving the
blessings, you do even speak ill of them, and frame accusations that
have no real being.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p24">Now Matthew indeed saith, “If I by the Spirit of
God cast out”; but Luke, “If I by the finger of God cast
out the devils:”<note n="1711" id="iii.XLI-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p25"><scripRef passage="Luke xi. 20" id="iii.XLI-p25.1" parsed="|Luke|11|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.20">Luke xi.
20</scripRef>.</p></note>implying that to cast out devils is a work of the greatest power, and
not of any ordinary grace. And He means indeed that from these things
they should infer and say, If this be so, then the Son of God is come.
This, however, He saith not, but in a reserved way, and so as not to be
galling to them, He darkly intimates it by saying, “Then the
kingdom of God is come unto you.”
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p26">Seest thou exceeding wisdom? By the very things which
they were blaming, He showed His presence shining forth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p27">Then, to conciliate them, He said not simply, “The
Kingdom is come,” but, “unto you,”<note n="1712" id="iii.XLI-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p28">[“upon you,” see note 4.]</p></note>as though He had said, To you the good things are come; wherefore then
feel displeased at your proper blessings? why war against your own
salvation? This is that time, which the prophets long ago foretold:
this, the sign of that advent which was celebrated by them, even these
things being wrought by divine power. For the fact indeed, that they
are wrought, yourselves know; but that they are wrought by divine
power, the deeds themselves cry out. Yea, and it is impossible that
Satan should be stronger now; rather he must of absolute necessity be
weak. But it cannot be, that he who is weak should, as though he were
strong, cast out the strong devil.
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p29">Now thus speaking He signified the power of charity, and
the weakness of separation and contentiousness. Wherefore He was
Himself also continually charging His disciples, on every occasion,
concerning charity, and teaching them that the devil, to subvert it,
leaves nothing undone.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p30">3. Having then uttered His second refutation, He adds
also a third, thus saying:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p31">“How can one enter into the strong man’s
house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and
then spoil his goods?”<note n="1713" id="iii.XLI-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 29" id="iii.XLI-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|12|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.29">Matt. xii.
29</scripRef>. [The R.V and A.V. follow
a different reading in the last clause.—R.]</p></note>
</p>

<pb n="260" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_260.html" id="iii.XLI-Page_260" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p33">For that Satan cannot possibly cast out Satan is evident
from what hath been said; but that neither in any other way is it
possible to cast him out, except one first get the better of him, this
too is acknowledged by all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p34">What then is established hereby? The former statement,
with more abundant evidence. “Why, I am so far,” saith He,
“from using the devil as an ally, that I make war upon him, and
bind him; and an infallible proof thereof is the plundering of his
goods.” See how the contrary is proved, of what they were
attempting to establish. For whereas they wished to show, that not by
His own power doth He cast out devils, He shows that not only the
devils, but even their very chief leader is held by Him bound with all
authority; and that over him, before them, did He prevail by His own
power. And this is evident from the things that are done. For if he be
the prince, and they subjects, how, except he were worsted, and made to
bow down, could they have been spoiled?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p35">And here His saying seems to me to be a prophecy
likewise. For not only, I suppose, are the evil spirits the goods of
the devil, but also the men that are doing his works. Therefore to
declare that He doth not only cast out devils, but also will drive away
all error from the world, and will put down his sorceries, and make all
his arts useless, He said these things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p36">And He said not, He will take away, but “He will
spoil,” to express what is done with authority. But He calls him
“strong,” not because he is so by nature, God forbid, but
declaring his former tyranny, which arose from our remissness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p37">4. “He that is not with me is against me, and he
that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.”<note n="1714" id="iii.XLI-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 30" id="iii.XLI-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|12|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.30">Matt. xii.
30</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p39">Behold also a fourth refutation. For what is my desire?
saith He. To bring men to God, to teach virtue, to proclaim the
kingdom. What, that of the devil, and the evil spirits? The contrary to
these. How then should he that gathers not with me, nor is at all with
me, be likely to co-operate with me? And why do I say co-operate? Nay,
on the contrary, his desire is rather to scatter abroad my goods. He
then who is so far from cooperating that he even scatters abroad, how
should he have exhibited such unanimity with me, as with me to cast out
the devils?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p40">Now it is a natural surmise that He said this not of the
devil only, but Himself also of Himself, as being for His part against
the devil, and scattering abroad his goods. And how, one may say, is he
that is not with me against me? By this very fact, of his not
gathering. But if this be true, much more he that is against him. For
if he that doth not co-operate is an enemy, much more he that wages
war.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p41">But all these things He saith, to indicate His enmity
against the devil, how great and unspeakable it is. For tell me, if
thou must go to war with any one, he that is not willing to fight on
thy side, by this very fact is he not against thee? And if elsewhere He
saith, “He that is not against you is for you,”<note n="1715" id="iii.XLI-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p42"><scripRef passage="Mark ix. 40; Luke ix. 50" id="iii.XLI-p42.1" parsed="|Mark|9|40|0|0;|Luke|9|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.9.40 Bible:Luke.9.50">Mark ix.
40; Luke ix. 50</scripRef>. [In Mark
“us” is better supported.—R.]</p></note>it is not contrary to this. For here He signified one actually against
them, but there He points to one who in part is on their side:
“For they cast out devils,” it is said “in Thy
name.”<note n="1716" id="iii.XLI-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p43"><scripRef passage="Mark ix. 38 ; Luke ix. 49" id="iii.XLI-p43.1" parsed="|Mark|9|38|0|0;|Luke|9|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.9.38 Bible:Luke.9.49">Mark ix. 38

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p44">But to me He seems here to be hinting also at the Jews,
setting them on the devil’s side. For they too were against Him,
and were scattering what He gathered. As to the fact that He was
hinting at them also, He declared it by speaking thus,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p45">“Therefore I say unto you, that all manner of sin
and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men.”<note n="1717" id="iii.XLI-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 31" id="iii.XLI-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|12|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.31">Matt. xii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p47">5. Thus having defended Himself, and refuted their
objection, and proved the vanity of their shameless dealings, He
proceeds to alarm them. For this too is no small part of advice and
correction, not only to plead and persuade, but to threaten also; which
He doth in many passages, when making laws and giving counsel.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p48">And though the saying seem to have much obscurity, yet
if we attend, its solution will prove easy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p49">First then it were well to listen to the very words:
“All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but
the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto them. And
whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven
him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
come.”<note n="1718" id="iii.XLI-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p50"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 31, 32" id="iii.XLI-p50.1" parsed="|Matt|12|31|12|32" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.31-Matt.12.32">Matt. xii.

almost identical with that followed in the R.V.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p51">What now is it that He affirms? Many things have ye
spoken against me; that I am a deceiver, an adversary of God. These
things I forgive you on your repentance, and exact no penalty of you;
but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven, no,

<pb n="261" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_261.html" id="iii.XLI-Page_261" />

not to those who repent. And how can this
be right? For even this was forgiven upon repentance. Many at least of
those who said these words believed afterward, and all was forgiven
them. What is it then that He saith? That this sin is above all things
unpardonable. Why so? Because Himself indeed they knew not, who He
might be, but of the Spirit they received ample experience. For the
prophets also by the Spirit said whatever they said; and indeed all in
the Old Testament had a very high notion of Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p52">What He saith, then, is this: Be it so: ye are offended
at me, because of the flesh with which I am encompassed: can ye say of
the Spirit also, We know it not? And therefore is your blasphemy
unpardonable, and both here and hereafter shall ye suffer punishment.
For many indeed have been punished here only (as he who had committed
fornication,<note n="1719" id="iii.XLI-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p53">See <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4,5" id="iii.XLI-p53.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|0|0|0;|1Cor|5|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4 Bible:1Cor.5">1 Cor. v. and vi</scripRef>.</p></note>as they who partook unworthily of the mysteries,<note n="1720" id="iii.XLI-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p54">See <scripRef passage="1 Cor. 4,5" id="iii.XLI-p54.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|0|0|0;|1Cor|5|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4 Bible:1Cor.5">1 Cor. v. and vi</scripRef>.</p></note>amongst the Corinthians); but ye, both here and hereafter.
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p55">Now as to your blasphemies against me, before the cross,
I forgive them: and the daring crime too of the cross itself; neither
shall ye be condemned for your unbelief alone. (For neither had they,
that believed before the cross, perfect faith. And on many occasions He
even charges them to make Him known to no man before the Passion; and
on the cross He said that this sin was forgiven them.) But as to your
words touching the Spirit, they will have no excuse. For in proof that
He is speaking of what was said of Him before the crucifixion, He
added, “Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it
shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy
Ghost,” there is no more forgiveness. Wherefore? Because this is
known to you; and the truths are notorious which you harden yourselves
against. For though ye say that ye know not me; yet of this surely ye
are not ignorant, that to cast out devils, and to do cures, is a work
of the Holy Ghost. It is not then I only whom ye are insulting, but the
Holy Ghost also. Wherefore your punishment can be averted by no
prayers, neither here nor there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p56">For so of men, some are punished both here, and there,
some here only, some there only, others neither here nor there. Here
and there, as these very men (for both here did they pay a penalty,
when they suffered those incurable ills at the taking of their city,
and there shall they undergo a very grievous one), as the inhabitants
of Sodom; as many others. There only, as the rich man who endured the
flames,<note n="1721" id="iii.XLI-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p57"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLI-p57.1">ἀποτηγανιζμενο</span>,
“was broiling.”</p></note>and had not at his command so much as a drop of water. Here, as he that
had committed fornication amongst the Corinthians. Neither here nor
there, as the apostles, as the prophets, as the blessed Job; for their
sufferings were not surely in the way of punishment, but as contests
and wrestlings.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p58">Let us labor, therefore, to be of the same part with
these: or if not with these, at least with them that wash away their
sins here. For fearful indeed is that other judgment, and inexorable
the vengeance, and incurable the punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p59">6. But if thou desire not to be punished even here, pass
judgment on thyself, exact thine own penalty. Listen to Paul, when he
saith, “If we would judge ourselves, we should not be
judged.”<note n="1722" id="iii.XLI-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p60"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xi. 31" id="iii.XLI-p60.1" parsed="|1Cor|11|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.11.31">1 Cor. xi.

crown.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p61">But how are we to exact our own penalty? one may
ask.  Lament, groan bitterly, humble, afflict thyself, call to
remembrance thy sins in their particulars. This thing is no small
torture to a man’s soul. If any man hath been in a state of
contrition, he knows that the soul is punished by this more than
anything. If any hath been living in remembrance of sins, he knows the
anguish thence arising. Therefore doth God appoint righteousness as a
reward for such repentance, saying, “Be thou first to tell thy
sins, that thou mayest be justified.”<note n="1723" id="iii.XLI-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p62"><scripRef passage="Isa. xliii. 26" id="iii.XLI-p62.1" parsed="|Isa|43|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.43.26">Isa. xliii.
26</scripRef> [<span class="c20" id="iii.XLI-p62.2">LXX</span>.].</p></note> For it is not, it is not indeed, a small step towards amendment, to lay
together all our sins, and to be continually revolving and reckoning
them up with their particulars. For he that is doing this will be so
heart-broken, as not to think himself worthy so much as to live; and he
that thinks thus, will be tenderer than any wax. For tell me not of
acts of fornication only, nor of adulteries, nor of these things that
are manifest, and acknowledged amongst all men: but lay together also
thy secret crafts, and thy false accusations, and thine evil speakings,
and thy vain gloryings, and thine envy, and all such things. For
neither will these bring a trifling punishment. For the reviler too
shall fall into hell; and the drunkard hath no part in the kingdom; and
he that lovest not his neighbor so offends God, as to find no help even
in his own martyrdom; and he that neglects his own hath denied the
faith, and he who overlooks the poor is sent into the fire.</p>

<pb n="262" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_262.html" id="iii.XLI-Page_262" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p63">Account not then these things to be little, but put all
together, and write them as in a book. For if thou write them down, God
blots them out; even as on the other hand, if thou omit writing them,
God both inscribes them, and exacts their penalty. It were then far
better for them to be written by us, and blotted out above, than on the
contrary, when we have forgotten them, for God to bring them before our
eyes in that day.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p64">Therefore that this may not be so, let us reckon up all
with strictness, and we shall find ourselves answerable for much. For
who is clear from covetousness? Nay, tell me not of the quantity, but
since even in a small amount we shall pay the same penalty, consider
this and repent. Who is rid of all insolence? Yet this casts into hell.
Who hath not secretly spoken evil of his neighbor? Yet this deprives
one of the Kingdom.<note n="1724" id="iii.XLI-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p65">[This clause is wanting in three <span class="c20" id="iii.XLI-p65.1">mss</span>.—R.]</p></note> Who hath not been self-willed? Yet this man is more unclean than all.
Who hath not looked with unchaste eyes? Yet this is a complete
adulterer. Who hath not been “angry with his brother without a
cause”? Yet such an one is “in danger of the
council.” Who hath not sworn? Yet this thing is of the evil one.
Who hath not forsworn himself? but this man is something more than of
the evil one. Who hath not served mammon? but this man is fallen away
from the genuine service of Christ.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p66">I have also other things greater than these to mention:
but even these are enough, and able, if a man be not made of stone, nor
utterly past feeling, to bring him to compunction. For if each one of
them casts into hell, what will they not bring to pass when all are met
together?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLI-p67">How then can one be saved? it may be asked. By
application of the countervailing remedies: alms, prayers, compunction,
repentance, humility, a contrite heart, contempt of possessions. For
God hath marked out for us innumerable ways of salvation, if we be
willing to attend. Let us then attend, and let us every way cleanse out
our wounds, showing mercy, remitting our anger against them that have
displeased us, giving thanks for all things to God, fasting according
to our power, praying sincerely, “making unto ourselves friends
of the mammon of unrighteousness.”<note n="1725" id="iii.XLI-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLI-p68"><scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 9" id="iii.XLI-p68.1" parsed="|Luke|16|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.9">Luke xvi.

and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.XLII-p3">“Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or
else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt; for the tree is
known by his fruit.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XLII-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.XLII-p4.1">Again</span> in another way He shames
them, and is not content with His former refutations. But this He doth,
not freeing Himself from accusations, (for what went before was quite
enough), but as wishing to amend them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p5">Now His meaning is like this: none of you hath either
found fault about the persons healed, as not being healed; nor hath
said, that it is an evil thing to deliver one from a devil. For though
they had been ever so shameless, they could not have said this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p6">Since therefore they brought no charge against the
works, but were defaming the Doer of them, He signifies that this
accusation is against both the common modes of reasoning, and the
congruity of the circumstances. A thing of aggravated shamelessness,
not only to interpret maliciously, but also to make up such charges as
are contrary to men’s common notions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p7">And see how free He is from contentiousness. For He said
not, “Make the tree good, forasmuch as the fruit also is
good;” but, most entirely stopping their mouths, and exhibiting
His own considerateness, and their insolence, He saith, Even if ye are

<pb n="263" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_263.html" id="iii.XLII-Page_263" />

minded to find fault with my
works, I forbid it not at all, only bring not inconsistent and
contradictory charges. For thus were they sure to be most clearly
detected, persisting against what was too palpable. Wherefore to no
purpose is your maliciousness, saith He, and your self-contradictory
statements. Because in truth the distinction of the tree is shown by
the fruit, not the fruit by the tree; but ye do the contrary. For what
if the tree be the origin of the fruit; yet it is the fruit that makes
the tree to be known. And it were consistent, either in blaming us to
find fault with our works too, or praising these, to set us who do them
free from these charges. But now ye do the contrary; for having no
fault to find with the works, which is the fruit, ye pass the opposite
judgment upon the tree, calling me a demoniac; which is utter
insanity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p8">Yea, and what He had said before,<note n="1726" id="iii.XLII-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLII-p9"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 16-18" id="iii.XLII-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|7|16|7|18" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.16-Matt.7.18">Matt. vii.
16–18</scripRef>.</p></note>this He establishes now also; that a good tree cannot bring forth evil
fruit, nor again can the converse be. So that their charges were
against all consistency and nature.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p10">Then since He is arguing not for Himself, but for the
Spirit, He hath dealt out His reproof even as a torrent, saying,
“O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
things?”<note n="1727" id="iii.XLII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLII-p11"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 34" id="iii.XLII-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|12|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.34">Matt. xii.
34</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p12">Now this is at once to accuse, and to give demonstration
of His own sayings from their case. For behold, saith He, ye being evil
trees, cannot bring forth good fruit. I do not then marvel at your
talking thus: for ye were both ill nurtured, being of wicked ancestors,
and ye have acquired a bad mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p13">And see how carefully, and without any hold for
exception, He hath expressed His accusations: in that He said not,
“How can ye speak good things, being a generation of vipers? (for
this latter is nothing to the former): but, “How can ye, being
evil, speak good things?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p14">But He called them “broods of vipers,”
because they prided themselves on their forefathers. To signify
therefore that they had no advantage thereby, He both casts them out
from their relationship to Abraham, and assigns them forefathers of
kindred disposition, having stripped them of that ground of
illustriousness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p15">“For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh.” Here again He indicates His Godhead, which knew their
secrets: and that not for words only, but also for wicked thoughts,
they shall suffer punishment; and that He knows it all, as God. And He
saith, that it is possible even for men to know these things; for this
is a natural consequence, that when wickedness is overflowing within,
its words should be poured forth through the lips. So that when thou
hearest a man speak wicked words, do not suppose only so much
wickedness to be in him as the words display, but conjecture the
fountain to be much more abundant; for that which is spoken outwardly,
is the superabundance of that which is within.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p16">See how vehemently He reprehends them. For if what they
had said is so evil, and is of the very mind of the devil, consider the
root and well-spring of their words, how far that must reach. And this
is naturally the case; for while the tongue through shame often pours
not forth all its wickedness at once, the heart having no human
witness, fearlessly gives birth to whatever evils it will; for of God
it hath not much regard.<note n="1728" id="iii.XLII-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLII-p17">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLII-p17.1">ο πολ
λγο ατ</span>, “it takes not much
account.”—R.]</p></note> Since then men’s sayings come to examination and are set before
all, but the heart is concealed; therefore the evils of the former grow
less, while those of the latter increase. But when that within is
multiplied, all that hath been awhile hidden comes forth with a violent
gushing. And as persons vomiting strive at first to keep down the
humors that force their way out, but, when they are overcome, cast
forth much abomination; so do they that devise evil things, and speak
ill of their neighbors.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p18">“A good man out of his good treasure,” saith
He, “bringeth forth good things, and an evil man out of his evil
treasure bringeth forth evil things.”<note n="1729" id="iii.XLII-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLII-p19"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 35" id="iii.XLII-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|12|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.35">Matt. xii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p20">For think not by any means, saith He, that it is so in
respect of wickedness only, for in goodness also the same occurs: for
there too the virtue within is more than the words without. By which He
signified, that both they were to be accounted more wicked than their
words indicated, and Himself more perfectly good than His sayings
declared. And He calls it “a treasure,” indicating its
abundance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p21">Then again He fences them in with great terror. For
think not at all, saith He, that the thing stops at this, that is, at
the condemnation of the multitude; nay, for all that do wickedly in
such things shall suffer the utmost punishment. And He said not,
“ye,” partly in order to instruct our whole race, partly to
make His saying the less burdensome.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p28">2. Wherefore not those that are slandered, but the
slanderers, have need to be anxious and to tremble. For the former are
not constrained to answer for themselves touching the evil things which
are said of them, but the latter will, for the evil they have spoken;
and over these impends the whole danger. So that the persons censured
should be without anxiety, not being to give account of the evil that
others have said; but the censurers have cause to be in anxiety, and to
tremble, as being themselves to be dragged before the judgment-seat in
that behalf. For this is indeed a diabolical snare, and a sin having in
it no pleasure, but harm only. Yea, and such an one is laying up an
evil treasure in his soul. And if he that hath an evil humor in him
doth himself first reap the fruits of the malady, much more he that is
treasuring up in himself what is more bitter than any bile, I mean,
wickedness, will suffer the utmost evils, gathering unto himself a
grievous disease. And it is evident from the things that He vomits out.
For if they pain others so much, far more the soul that gives them
birth.</p>

more wretched and miserable? was it not he that did wrong? And mark it.
Saul had promised, if David should slay the Philistine, to take him for
his son-in law, and to give him his daughter with great favor. He slew
the Philistine; the other broke his engagements, and so far from
bestowing her, did even go about to slay him. Which then became the
more glorious? Was not the one choking with despair and the evil demon,
while the other shone brighter than the sun with his trophies, and his
loyalty to God? Again, before the choir of the women, was not the one
suffocated with envy, while the other enduring all in silence, won all
men, and bound them unto himself? And when he had even gotten him into
his hands, and spared him, which again was happy? and which wretched?
which was the weaker? which the more powerful? Was it not this man, who
did not avenge himself even justly? And very naturally. For the one had
armed soldiers, but the other, righteousness, that is more mighty than
ten thousand armies, for his ally and helper. And for this reason,
though unjustly conspired against, he endured not to slay him even
justly. For he knew by what had taken place before, that not to do
evil, but to suffer evil, this is what makes men more powerful. So it
is with bodies also, so also with trees.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p33">And what did Jacob? Was he not injured by Laban, and
suffered evil? Which then was the stronger? he that had gotten the

him than innumerable kings?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p35">But that I may give you another demonstration of what I
have said, greater than this, let us again in the instance of David
himself try the reasoning on the opposite side. For this man who being
injured was so strong, afterwards upon committing an injury became on
the contrary the weaker party. At least, when he had wronged Uriah, his
position was changed again, and the weakness passed to the wrong doer,
and the might to the injured; for he being dead laid waste the
other’s house. And the one being a king, and alive, could do
nothing, but the other, being but a soldier, and slain, turned upside
down all that pertained to his adversary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p36">Would ye that in another way also I should make what I
say plainer? Let us look into their case, who avenge themselves even
justly. For as to the wrong doers, that they are the most worthless of
all men, warring against their own soul; this is surely plain to every
one.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p37">But who avenged himself justly, yet kindled innumerable
ills, and pierced himself through with many calamities and sorrows? The
captain of David’s host. For he both stirred up a grievous war,
and suffered unnumbered evils; not one whereof would have happened, had
he but known how to command himself.<note n="1735" id="iii.XLII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLII-p38">See <scripRef passage="2 Sam. 3.23-30; 10.9,10; 1 Kings 2.5,6" id="iii.XLII-p38.1" parsed="|2Sam|3|23|3|30;|2Sam|10|9|10|10;|1Kgs|2|5|2|6" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.3.23-2Sam.3.30 Bible:2Sam.10.9-2Sam.10.10 Bible:1Kgs.2.5-1Kgs.2.6">2 Samuel iii. 23–30,

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p39">Let us flee therefore from this sin, and neither in
words nor deeds do our neighbors wrong. For He said not, If thou
slander, and summon a court of justice, but simply, If thou speak evil,
though within thyself, even so shalt thou suffer the utmost punishment.
Though it be true which thou hast said, though thou have spoken upon
conviction, even so shall vengeance come upon thee. For not according
to what the other hath done, but according to what thou hast spoken,
will God pass sentence; “for by thy words thou shalt be
condemned,” saith He. Art thou not told that the Pharisee also
spake the truth, and affirmed what was manifest to all men, without
discovering what was hidden? Nevertheless, he paid the utmost
penalty.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p40">But if we ought not to accuse men of things which are
acknowledged, much less of those which are disputed; nay, for the
offender hath a judge. Do not now, I warn thee, seize upon the
privilege of the Only Begotten. For Him is the throne of judgment
reserved.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p41">3. Wouldest thou however be a judge? Thou hast a court
of judgment which hath great profit, and bears no blame. Make
consideration, as judge, to sit down upon thy conscience, and bring
before it all thy transgressions, search out the sins of thy soul, and
exact with strictness the account thereof, and say, “wherefore
didst thou dare to do this and that?” And if she shun these, and
be searching into other men’s matters, say to her, “Not
about these am I judging thee, not for these art thou come here to
plead. For what, if such a one be a wicked man? Thou, why didst thou
commit this and that offense? Answer for thyself, not to accuse; look
to thine own matters, do not those of others.” And be thou
continually urging her to this anxious trial. Then, if she have nothing
to say, but shrink back, wear her out with the scourge, like some
restless and unchaste handmaid. And this tribunal do thou cause to sit
every day, and picture the river of fire, the venomous worm, the rest
of the torments.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p42">And permit her not to be with the devil any more, nor
bear with her shameless sayings, “he comes to me, he plots
against me, he tempts me;” but tell her, “If thou wert not
willing, all that would be to no purpose.” And if she say again,
“I am entangled with a body, I am clothed with flesh, I dwell in
the world, I abide on earth;” tell her, “All these are
excuses and pretexts. For such an one too was encompassed with flesh,
and such another dwelling in the world, and abiding on earth, is
approved; and thou thyself too, when thou doest well, doest it
encompassed with flesh.” And if she be pained at hearing this,
take not off thine hand; for she will not die, if thou smite her, but
thou wilt save her from death. And if she say again, “Such an one
provoked me,” tell her, “But it is in thy power not to be
provoked; often at least thou hast restrained thine anger.” And
if she say, “The beauty of such a woman moved me;” tell
her, “Yet wast thou able to have mastered thyself.” Bring
forward those that have got the better, bring forward the first woman,
who said, “The serpent beguiled me,”<note n="1736" id="iii.XLII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLII-p43"><scripRef passage="Gen. iii. 13" id="iii.XLII-p43.1" parsed="|Gen|3|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.13">Gen. iii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p44">And when thou art searching out these things, let no man
be present, let no man disturb thee; but as the judges sit under
curtains to judge, so do thou too, instead of curtains, seek a time and
place of quiet. And when after thy supper thou art risen up, and art
about to lie down, then hold this thy judgment; this is the time
convenient for thee, and the place, thy bed, and thy chamber. This the
prophet likewise commanded, saying, “For the things which ye say
in your hearts, be ye moved to compunction upon your beds.”<note n="1737" id="iii.XLII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLII-p45"><scripRef passage="Ps. iv. 4" id="iii.XLII-p45.1" parsed="|Ps|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.4.4">Ps. iv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p49">4. But we do not so, but altogether the contrary. For as
soon as we are laid down to rest, we rather think over all our worldly
matters; and some introduce unclean thoughts, some usuries, and
contracts, and temporal cares.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p50">And if we have a daughter, a virgin, we watch her
strictly; but that which is more precious to us than a daughter, our
soul, her we suffer to play the harlot and defile herself, introducing
to her innumerable wicked thoughts. And whether it be the love of
covetousness, or that of luxury, or that of fair persons, or that of
wrath, or be it what you will else that is minded to come in, we throw
open the doors, and attract and invite it, and help it to defile our
soul at its leisure. And what can be more barbarous than this, to
overlook our soul that is more precious than all, abused by so many
adulterers, and so long companying with them, even until they are
sated? which will never be. So it is, therefore, that when sleep
overtakes us, then only do they depart from her; or rather not even
then, for our dreams and imaginations furnish her with the same images.
Whence also, when day is come, the soul stored with such images often
falls away to the actual performance of those fancies.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p51">And thou, while into the apple of thine eye thou
sufferest not so much as a grain of dust to enter, dost thou pass
unnoticed thy soul, gathering to itself a heap of so great evils? When
shall we then be able to clear out this filth, which we are daily
laying up within us? when to cut up the thorns? when to sow the seed?
Knowest thou not that henceforth the time of harvest is at hand? But we
have not yet so much as ploughed our fields. If then the husbandman
should come and find fault, what shall we say? and what answer shall we
make? That no man gave us the seed? Nay, this is sown daily. That no
man, then, hath cut up the thorns? Nay, every day we are sharpening the
sickle. But do the necessary engagements of life distract thee? And why
hast thou not crucified thyself to the world? For if he that repays
that only, which is given him, is wicked, because he did not double it;
he that hath wasted even this, what will be said to him? If that person
was bound, and cast out where is gnashing of teeth, what shall we have
to suffer, who, when numberless motives are drawing us toward virtue,
shrink back and are unwilling?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p52">For what is there, that hath not enough in it to
persuade thee? Seest thou not the vileness of the world, the
uncertainty of life, the toil, the sweat, for things present? What? is
it the case that virtue must be toiled for, but may vice be had without
toil? If then both in the one and in the other there is toil, why didst
thou not choose this, which hath so great profit?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p53">Or rather, there are some parts of virtue, which are
free even from toil. For what kind of toil is it, not to calumniate,
not to lie, not to swear, to lay aside our anger against our neighbor?
Nay, on the contrary, to do these things is toilsome, and brings much
anxiety.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p54">What plea then shall we have, what excuse, not doing
right even in these matters? For hereby it is plain, that out of
remissness and sloth the more toilsome duties also altogether escape
us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLII-p55">All these things let us consider; let us flee vice, let
us choose virtue, that we may attain both unto the good things that are
present, and unto those that are to come, by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.XLIII-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XLIII-p5.1">Could</span> then anything be more
foolish than these men (not more impious only), who after so many
miracles, as though none had been wrought, say, “We would see a
sign from Thee?” With what intent then did they so speak? That
they might lay hold of Him again. For since by His words He had stopped
their mouths, once and twice

<pb n="267" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_267.html" id="iii.XLIII-Page_267" />

and
often, and had checked their shameless tongue, they come to His works
again. At which also the evangelist marvelling again, said,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p6">“Then certain of the scribes answered Him, asking
a sign.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p7">“Then,” when? When they ought to be stooping
before Him, to admire, to be amazed and give way, “then”
they desist not from their wickedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p8">And see their words too, teeming with flattery and
dissimulation. For they thought to draw Him towards them in that way.
And now they insult, now they flatter Him; now calling Him a demoniac,
now again “Master,” both out of an evil mind, how contrary
soever the words they speak.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p9">Wherefore also He rebukes them severely. And when they
were questioning Him roughly and insulting Him, He reasoned with them
gently; when they were flattering; reproachfully, and with great
severity; implying that He is superior to either passion, and is
neither at the one time moved to anger, nor at the other softened by
flattery. And see His reproach, that it is not merely hard words, but
contains a demonstration of their wickedness. For what saith He?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p10">“An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a
sign.” Now what He saith is to this effect: What marvel if ye
behave so to me who have been hitherto unknown to you when even to the
Father, of whom ye have had so much experience, ye have done the very
same? forsaking Him, ye have run unto the devils, drawing to yourselves
wicked lovers. With this Ezekiel too was continually upbraiding
them.<note n="1741" id="iii.XLIII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p11">See <scripRef passage="Ezek. xvi. 23" id="iii.XLIII-p11.1" parsed="|Ezek|16|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.16.23">Ezek.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p12">Now by these sayings He signified Himself to be of one
accord with His Father, and them to be doing nothing new; He was also
unfolding their secrets, how with hypocrisy and as enemies they were
making their demand. Therefore He called them “an evil
generation,” because they have been always ungrateful towards
their benefactors; because upon favors they become worse, which belongs
to extreme wickedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p13">And He called it “adulterous,” declaring
both their former and their present unbelief; whereby He implies
Himself again to be equal to the Father, if at least the not believing
Him makes it “adulterous.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p14">2. Then, after His reproach, what saith He? “There
shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.”
Now is He striking the first note of the doctrine of His resurrection,
and confirming it by the type.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p15">What then? one may say; was no sign given it? None was
given to it on asking. For not to bring in them did He work His signs
(for He knew them to be hardened), but in order to amend others. Either
then this may be said, or that they were not to receive such a sign as
that was. For a sign did befall them, when by their own punishment they
learnt His power. Here then He speaks as threatening, and with this
very meaning obscurely conveyed: as if He said, innumerable benefits
have I showed forth, none of these hath drawn you to me, neither were
ye willing to adore my power. Ye shall know therefore my might by the
contrary tokens, when ye shall see your city cast down to the ground,
the walls also dismantled, the temple become a ruin; when ye shall be
cast out both from your former citizenship and freedom, and shall again
go about everywhere, houseless and in exile. (For all these things came
to pass after the cross.) These things therefore shall be to you for
great signs. And indeed it is an exceeding great sign, that their ills
remain unchanged; that although ten thousand have attempted it, no one
hath been able to reverse<note n="1742" id="iii.XLIII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p16"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIII-p16.1">διορθσαι</span>.</p></note>the judgment once gone forth against them.</p>

the things which they should afterwards suffer.</p>

would have even laughed Him to scorn, but He intimated it in such

did He
allow three days, that the fact of His death might be believed. For not
by the cross only doth He make it certain, and by the sight of all men,
but also by the time of those days. For to the resurrection indeed all
succeeding time was to bear witness; but the cross, unless it had at
the time many signs bearing witness to it, would have been disbelieved;
and with this disbelief would have gone utter disbelief of the
resurrection also. Therefore He calls it also a sign. But had He not
been crucified, the sign would not have been given. For this cause too
He brings forward the type, that the truth may be believed. For tell
me, was Jonah in the whale’s belly a mere appearance? Nay, thou
canst not say so. Therefore neither was Christ in the heart of the
earth such. For surely the type is not in truth, and the truth in mere
appearance. For this cause we every where show forth His death, both in
the mysteries, and in baptism, and in all the rest. Therefore Paul also
cries with a clear voice, “God forbid that I should glory, save
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”<note n="1747" id="iii.XLIII-p23.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p24"><scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 14" id="iii.XLIII-p24.1" parsed="|Gal|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.14">Gal. vi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p31">What then can the saying mean? As the possessed, saith
He, when delivered from that infirmity, should they be at all remiss,
draw upon themselves their delusion more grievous than ever: even so is
it with you. For before also ye were possessed by a devil, when ye were
worshipping idols, and were slaying your sons to the devils, exhibiting
great madness; nevertheless I forsook you not, but cast out that devil
by the prophets; and again in my own person I am come, willing to
cleanse you more entirely. Since then you will not attend, but have
wrecked yourselves in greater wickedness (for to kill prophets was a
crime not nearly so great and grievous as to slay Him); therefore your
sufferings will be more grievous than the former, those at Babylon, I
mean, and in Egypt, and under the first Antiochus. Because what things

be also utterly destitute of all virtue, and more assailable by the
power of the devils, than at that time. For then even although they
sinned, yet were there also among them such as acted uprightly, and
God’s providence was present with them, and the grace of the
Spirit, tending, correcting, fulfilling all its part; but now of this
guardianship too they shall be utterly deprived; so He tells them; so
that there is now both a greater scarcity

<pb n="269" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_269.html" id="iii.XLIII-Page_269" />

of virtue, and a more intense affliction, and a more
tyrannical operation of the devils.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p33">Ye know accordingly even in our generation, when he who
surpassed all in impiety, I mean Julian, was transported with his fury,
how they ranged themselves with the heathens, how they courted their
party. So that, even if they seem to be in some small degree chastened
now, the fear of the emperors makes them quiet; since, if it were not
for that, far worse than the former had been their daring. For in all
their other evil works they surpass their predecessors; sorceries,
magic arts, impurities, they exhibit in great excess. And amongst the
rest, moreover, strong as is the curb which holds them down, they have
often made seditions, and risen up against kings, which has resulted in
their being pierced through with the worst of evils.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p34">Where now are they that seek after signs? Let them hear
that a considerate mind is needed, and if this be wanting, signs are of
no profit. See, for instance, how the Ninevites without signs believed,
while these, after so many miracles, grew worse, and made themselves an
habitation of innumerable devils, and brought on themselves ten
thousand calamities; and very naturally. For when a man, being once
delivered from his ills, fails to be corrected, he will suffer far
worse than before. Yea, therefore He said, “he finds no
rest,” to indicate, that positively and of necessity such an one
will be overtaken by the ambush of the devils. Since surely by these
two things he ought to have been sobered, by his former sufferings, and
by his deliverance; or rather a third thing also is added, the threat
of having still worse to endure. But yet by none of these were they
made better.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p35">5. All this might be seasonably said, not of them only,
but of us also, when after having been enlightened,<note n="1753" id="iii.XLIII-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p36"><scripRef passage="Heb. vi. 4" id="iii.XLIII-p36.1" parsed="|Heb|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.6.4">Heb. vi.
4</scripRef>.</p></note>and delivered from our former ills, we again cleave unto the same
wickedness, for more grievous also thenceforth will be the punishment
of our subsequent sins. Therefore to the sick of the palsy also Christ
said, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse
thing come unto thee;”<note n="1754" id="iii.XLIII-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p37"><scripRef passage="John v. 14" id="iii.XLIII-p37.1" parsed="|John|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.14">John v.
14</scripRef>.</p></note>and this to a man who was thirty-eight years in his infirmity. And
what, one might ask, was he to suffer worse than this? Something far
worse, and more intolerable. For far be it from us, that we should
endure as much as we are capable of enduring. For God is at no loss for
inflictions. For according to the greatness of His mercy, so also is
His wrath.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p38">With this He charges Jerusalem also by Ezekiel. “I
saw thee,” saith He, “polluted in blood; and I washed thee,
and anointed thee; and thou hadst renown for thy beauty; and thou
pouredst out thy fornications,” saith He, “on those who
dwell near thee,”<note n="1755" id="iii.XLIII-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p39"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xvi. 6, 9, 14, 26" id="iii.XLIII-p39.1" parsed="|Ezek|16|6|0|0;|Ezek|16|9|0|0;|Ezek|16|14|0|0;|Ezek|16|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.16.6 Bible:Ezek.16.9 Bible:Ezek.16.14 Bible:Ezek.16.26">Ezek. xvi.

sinnest.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p40">But from hence infer not thy punishment only, but also
the boundless longsuffering of God. How often at least have we put our
hands to the same evil deeds, and yet He suffers long! But let us not
be sanguine, but fear; since Pharaoh too, had he been taught by the
first plague, would not have experienced the later ones; he would not
afterwards have been drowned, his host and all together.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p41">And this I say, because I know many, who like Pharaoh

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p44">“But we have no Red Sea now, to pass through
afterwards.” But we have a sea of fire, a sea not like that,
either in kind or in size, but far greater and fiercer, having its
waves of fire, of some strange and horrible fire. A great abyss is
there, of most intolerable flame. Since everywhere fire may be seen
roving quickly round, like some savage wild beast. And if here this
sensible and material fire leaped like a wild beast out of the furnace,
and sprang upon those who were sitting without,<note n="1758" id="iii.XLIII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p45"><scripRef passage="Dan. iii. 22" id="iii.XLIII-p45.1" parsed="|Dan|3|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.22">Dan. iii.

delivered over to certain cruel men, and see none of their friends, but
those only that are set over them; so will it be then also: or rather
not so, but even far more grievous. For here it is possible to go unto
the king, and entreat, and free the condemned person: but there, no
longer; for He permits it not, but they continue in the scorching
torment,<note n="1760" id="iii.XLIII-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p48"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIII-p48.1">ἀποτηγανιζμενοι</span>.</p></note>and in so great anguish, as it is not possible for words to tell. For
if, when any are in flames here, no speech can describe their sharp
pangs, much less theirs, who suffer it in that place: since here indeed
all is over in a brief point

of
time, but in that place there is burning indeed, but what is burnt is
not consumed.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p49">What then shall we do there? For to my self also do I
say these things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p50">6. “But if thou,” saith one, “who art
our teacher, speakest so of thyself, I care no more; for what wonder,
should I be punished?” Nay, I entreat, let no man seek this
consolation; for this is no refreshment at all. For tell me; was not
the devil an incorporeal power? Was he not superior to men? Yet he fell
away. Is there any one who will derive consolation from being punished
along with him? By no means. What of all who were in Egypt? did they
not see those also punished who were in high places, and every house in
mourning? Were they then hereby refreshed, and comforted? No surely;
and it is manifest by what they did afterwards, as men tortured by some
kind of fire, rising up together against the king, and compelling him
to cast out the people of the Hebrews.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p51">Yea, and very unmeaning is this saying, to suppose that
it gives comfort to be punished with all men, to say, “As all, so
I too.” For why should I speak of hell? Think, I pray you, of
those that are seized with gout, how, when they are racked by sharp
pain, though you show them ten thousand suffering worse, they do not so
much as take it into their mind. For the intensity of their anguish
allows not their reason any leisure for thinking of others, and so
finding consolation. Let us not then feed ourselves with these cold
hopes. For to receive consolation from the ills of our neighbors, takes
place in ordinary sufferings; but when the torment is excessive, and
all our inward parts full of tempest, and the soul is now come to be
unable so much as to know itself, whence shall it derive consolation?
So that all these sayings are an absurdity, and fables of foolish
children. For this, of which thou speakest, takes place in dejection,
and in moderate dejection, when we are told, “the same thing hath
befallen such an one;” but sometimes not even in dejection: now
if in that case it hath no strength, much less in the anguish and
burden unspeakable, which “the gnashing of teeth”
indicates.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p52">And I know that I am galling you, and giving you pain by
these words; but what can I do? For I would fain not speak thus, but be
conscious of virtue both in myself, and in all of you; but since we are
in sins, the more part of us, who will grant me ability to pain you
indeed, and to penetrate the understanding of them that hear me? Then
might I so be at rest. But now I fear lest any despise my sayings, and
their punishments become the greater for their indifferent way of
hearing. Since, when a master utters a threat, should one of the
fellow-servants hear and make light of his menace, not without
punishment would he hasten by him, provoked as he is, but rather it
would be a ground for increasing his chastisement. Wherefore I entreat
you, let us pierce our own hearts, when we hear His sayings regarding
hell. For nothing is more delightful than this discourse, by how much
nothing is more bitter than the reality. But how delightful to be told
of hell? one may ask. Because it were so far from delight to fall into
hell, which result, our words that appear so galling, keep off. And
before this they furnish another pleasure: in that they brace up our
souls, and make us more reverent, and elevate the mind, and give wings
to the thoughts, and cast out the desires that so mischievously beset
us; and the thing becomes a cure.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p53">7. Wherefore, to proceed, together with the punishment
let me speak also of the shame. For as the Jews shall then be condemned
by the Ninevites, so we too by many that seem beneath us now.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p54">Let us imagine then how great the mockery, how great the
condemnation; let us imagine, and cast some foundation at length, some
door of repentance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p55">To myself I say these things, to myself first I give
this advice, and let no one be angry, as though he were condemned. Let
us enter upon the narrow way. How long shall it be luxury? how long
sloth? Have we not had enough of indolence, mirth, procrastination?
Will it not be the same over again, feasting, and surfeiting, and
expense, and wealth, and acquisitions, and buildings? And what is the
end? Death. What is the end? Ashes, and dust, and coffins, and
worms.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p56">Let us show forth then a new kind of life. Let us make
earth, heaven; let us hereby show the Greeks, of how great blessings
they are deprived. For when they behold in us good conversation, they
will look upon the very face of the kingdom of Heaven. Yea, when they
see us gentle, pure from wrath, from evil desire, from envy, from
covetousness, rightly fulfilling all our other duties, they will say,
“If the Christians are become angels here, what will they be
after their departure hence? if where they are strangers they shine so
bright, how great will they become when they shall have won their
native land!” Thus they too will be reformed, and the word of
godliness “will have free course,”<note n="1761" id="iii.XLIII-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p57"><scripRef passage="2 Thess. iii. 1" id="iii.XLIII-p57.1" parsed="|2Thess|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.3.1">2 Thess.

<pb n="271" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_271.html" id="iii.XLIII-Page_271" />

For if they, being twelve, converted entire cities and
countries; were we all to become teachers by our careful conduct,
imagine how high our cause will be exalted. For not even a dead man
raised so powerfully attracts the Greek, as a person practising
self-denial. At that indeed he will be amazed, but by this he will be
profited. That is done, and is past away; but this abides, and is
constant culture to his soul.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p58">Let us take heed therefore to ourselves, that we may
gain them also. I say nothing burdensome. I say not, do not marry. I
say not, forsake cities, and withdraw thyself from public affairs; but
being engaged in them, show virtue. Yea, and such as are busy in the
midst of cities, I would fain have more approved than such as have
occupied the mountains. Wherefore? Because great is the profit thence
arising. “For no man lighteth a candle, and setteth it under the
bushel.”<note n="1762" id="iii.XLIII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIII-p59"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 15; Luke xi. 33" id="iii.XLIII-p59.1" parsed="|Matt|5|15|0|0;|Luke|11|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.15 Bible:Luke.11.33">Matt. v.
15; Luke xi. 33</scripRef>.</p></note> Therefore I would that all the candles were set upon the candlestick,
that the light might wax great.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p60">Let us kindle then His fire; let us cause them that are
sitting in darkness to be delivered from their error. And tell me not,
“I have a wife, and children belonging to me, and am master of a
household, and cannot duly practise all this.” For though thou
hadst none of these, yet if thou be careless, all is lost; though thou
art encompassed with all these, yet if thou be earnest, thou shalt
attain unto virtue. For there is but one thing that is wanted, the
preparation of a generous mind; and neither age, nor poverty, nor
wealth, nor reverse of fortune, nor anything else, will be able to
impede thee. Since in fact both old and young, and men having wives,
and bringing up children, and working at crafts, and serving as
soldiers, have duly performed all that is enjoined. For so Daniel was
young, and Joseph a slave, and Aquila wrought at a craft, and the woman
who sold purple was over a workshop, and another was the keeper of a
prison, and another a centurion, as Cornelius; and another in ill
health, as Timothy; and another a runaway, as Onesimus; but nothing
proved an hindrance to any of these, but all were approved, both men
and women, both young and old, both slaves and free, both soldiers and
people.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIII-p61">Let us not then make vain pretexts, but let us provide a
thoroughly good mind, and whatsoever we may be, we shall surely attain
to virtue, and arrive at the good things to come; by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto the Father,
together with the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

had both these, evidently this was the maternity in respect of which
His mother was to be blessed. For to hear the Word of God and keep it
belongs to a pure soul, looking altogether towards God. And since it
was no ordinary woman whom God selected to become the mother of Christ,
but her who in virtues held a place higher than all women, therefore
Christ also willed His mother to be called blessed from this virtue,
whereby she was deemed worthy to become a virgin mother.”

or if they were not so minded, to have waited for His bringing His
discourse to an end, and then to have come near; they call Him out, and
do this before all, evincing a superfluous vanity, and wishing to make
it appear, that with much authority they enjoin Him. And this too the
evangelist shows that he is blaming, for with this very allusion did he
thus express himself, “While He yet talked to the people;”
as if he should say, What? was there no other opportunity? Why, was it
not possible to speak with Him in private?</p>

touching the doctrines of the truth, they ought to have propounded
these things publicly, and stated them before all, that the rest also

not the burial of a father, lest the attendance on Him should be
interrupted, much less ought they to have stopped His discourse to the

heal their infirmity; since surely, had it been His will to deny His
mother, He would have denied her then, when the Jews were reproaching
Him. But as it is, we see that He takes so great care of her, as even
at the very cross to commit her to the disciple whom He loved most of
all, and to give him a great charge concerning her.</p>

with what purpose He reproved; that it was not with intent to drive
them to perplexity, but to deliver them from the most tyrannical
passion and to lead them on by little and little to the right idea
concerning Himself, and to convince her that He was not her Son only,
but also her Lord: so wilt thou perceive that the reproof is in the
highest degree both becoming Him and profitable to her, and withal
having in it much gentleness. For He said not, “Go thy way, tell
my mother, thou art not my mother,” but He addresses Himself to
the person that told Him; saying, “Who is my mother?”
together with the things that have been mentioned providing for another
object also. What then is that? That neither they nor others confiding
in their kindred, should neglect virtue. For if she is nothing profited

<pb n="273" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_273.html" id="iii.XLIV-Page_273" />

by being His mother, were it not
for that quality in her, hardly will any one else be saved by his
kindred. For there is one only nobleness, to do the will of God. This
kind of noble birth is better than the other, and more real.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p17">2. Knowing therefore these things, let us neither pride
ourselves on children that are of good report, unless we have their
virtue; nor upon noble fathers, unless we be like them in disposition.
For it is possible, both that he who begat a man should not be his
father, and that he who did not beget him should be. Therefore in
another place also, when some woman had said, “Blessed is the
womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked;” He
said not, “The womb bare me not, neither did I suck the
paps,” but this, “Yea rather, blessed are they that do the
will of my Father.”<note n="1769" id="iii.XLIV-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p18"><scripRef passage="Luke xi. 27, 28" id="iii.XLIV-p18.1" parsed="|Luke|11|27|11|28" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.27-Luke.11.28">Luke xi.
27, 28</scripRef>. [According to many
Harmonists this occurred about the same time, probably as His mother
was seen approaching.—R.]</p></note> Seest thou how on every occasion He denies not the affinity by nature,
but adds that by virtue? And His forerunner too, in saying, “O
generation of vipers, think not to say, We have Abraham to our
father,”<note n="1770" id="iii.XLIV-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p19"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 7, 9" id="iii.XLIV-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|3|7|0|0;|Matt|3|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.7 Bible:Matt.3.9">Matt. iii.

profits them nothing to be of Abraham, unless they had the affinity by
character; which Christ also declared, when He said, “If ye were
Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham;”<note n="1771" id="iii.XLIV-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p20"><scripRef passage="John viii. 39" id="iii.XLIV-p20.1" parsed="|John|8|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.39">John viii.
39</scripRef>.</p></note>not depriving them of their kindred according to the flesh, but
teaching them to seek after that affinity which is greater than it, and
more real.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p21">This then He establishes here also, but in a manner less
invidious, and more measured, as became Him speaking to His mother. For
He said not at all, “She is not my mother, nor are those my
brethren, because they do not my will;” neither did He declare
and pronounce judgment against them; but He yet left in it their own
power to choose, speaking with the gentleness that becomes Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p22">“For he that doeth,” saith He, “the
will of my Father, this is my brother, and sister, and
mother.”<note n="1772" id="iii.XLIV-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p23"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 50" id="iii.XLIV-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|13|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.50">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p24">Wherefore if they desire to be such, let them come this
way. And when the woman again cried out, saying, “Blessed is the
womb that bare Thee,” He said not, “She is not my
mother,” but, “If she wishes to be blessed, let her do the
will of my Father. For such a one is both brother, and sister, and
mother.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p25">Oh honor! oh virtue! Unto what a height doth she lead up
him that follows after her! How many women have blessed that holy
Virgin, and her womb, and prayed that they might become such mothers,
and give up all! What then is there to hinder? For behold, He hath
marked out a spacious road for us; and it is granted not to women only,
but to men also, to be of this rank, or rather of one yet far higher.
For this makes one His mother much more, than those pangs did. So that
if that were a subject for blessing, much more this, inasmuch as it is
also more real. Do not therefore merely desire, but also in the way
that leads thee to thy desire walk thou with much diligence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p26">3. Having then said these words, “He came out of
the house.” Seest thou, how He both rebuked them, and did what
they desired? Which He did also at the marriage.<note n="1773" id="iii.XLIV-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p27"><scripRef passage="John ii. 1-11" id="iii.XLIV-p27.1" parsed="|John|2|1|2|11" osisRef="Bible:John.2.1-John.2.11">John ii.
1–11</scripRef>.</p></note> For there too He at once reproved her asking unseasonably, and
nevertheless did not gainsay her; by the former correcting her
weakness, by the latter showing His kindly feeling toward His mother.
So likewise on this occasion too, He both healed the disease of
vainglory, and rendered the due honor to His mother, even though her
request was unseasonable. For, “in the same day,” it is
said, “went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
side.”<note n="1774" id="iii.XLIV-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. 13.1" id="iii.XLIV-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|13|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.1">Chap. xiii. 1</scripRef>. [R.V., “On that day,”

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p29">Why, if ye desire, saith He, to see and hear, behold I
come forth and discourse. Thus having wrought many miracles, He affords
again the benefit of His doctrine. And He “sits by the
sea,” fishing and getting into His net them that are on the
land.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p30">But He “sat by the sea,” not without a
purpose; and this very thing the evangelist has darkly expressed. For
to indicate that the cause of His doing this was a desire to order His
auditory with exactness, and to leave no one behind His back, but to
have all face to face,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p31">“And great multitudes,” saith He,
“were gathered together unto Him, so that He went into a ship and
sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore.”<note n="1775" id="iii.XLIV-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 2" id="iii.XLIV-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|13|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.2">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p33">And having sat down there, He speaks by parables.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p34">“And He spake,” it says, “many things
unto them in parables.”<note n="1776" id="iii.XLIV-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p35"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 3" id="iii.XLIV-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.3">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p36">And yet on the mount, we know, He did no such thing,
neither did He weave His discourse with so many parables, for then
there were multitudes only, and a simple people; but here are also
Scribes and Pharisees.</p>

<pb n="274" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_274.html" id="iii.XLIV-Page_274" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p37">But do thou mark, I pray thee, what kind of parable He
speaks first, and how Matthew puts them in their order. Which then doth
He speak first? That which it was most necessary to speak first, that
which makes the hearer more attentive. For because He was to discourse
unto them in dark sayings, He thoroughly rouses His hearers’ mind
first by His parable. Therefore also another evangelist saith that He
reproved them, because they do not understand; saying, “How knew
ye not the parable?”<note n="1777" id="iii.XLIV-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p38"><scripRef passage="Mark iv. 13" id="iii.XLIV-p38.1" parsed="|Mark|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.4.13">Mark iv.
13</scripRef>. [Freely cited.]</p></note> But not for this cause only doth He speak in parables, but that He may
also make His discourse more vivid, and fix the memory of it in them
more perfectly, and bring the things before their sight. In like manner
do the prophets also.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p39">4. What then is the parable? “Behold,” saith
He, “a sower<note n="1778" id="iii.XLIV-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p40">[R.V., “the sower.”]</p></note>went forth to sow.” Whence went He forth, who is present
everywhere, who fills all things? or how went He forth? Not in place,
but in condition and dispensation to usward, coming nearer to us by His
clothing Himself with flesh. For because we could not enter, our sins
fencing us out from the entrance, He comes forth unto us. And wherefore
came He forth? to destroy the ground teeming with thorns? to take
vengeance upon the husbandmen? By no means; but to till and tend it,
and to sow the word of godliness. For by seed here He means His
doctrine, and by land, the souls of men, and by the sower, Himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p41">What then comes of this seed? Three parts perish, and
one is saved.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p42">“And when He sowed, some seeds fell,” He
saith, “by the way side; and the fowls came and devoured them
up.”<note n="1779" id="iii.XLIV-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 4" id="iii.XLIV-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.4">Matt. xiii.

sowed,” etc.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p44">He said not, that He cast them, but that “they
fell.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p45">“And some upon the rock, where they had not much
earth; and forthwith they sprang up, because they had no deepness of
earth; and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
had no root, they withered away. And some fell among the thorns, and
the thorns sprang up, and choked them. But others fell on the good
ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold,
some thirtyfold. Who hath ears to hear let him hear.”<note n="1780" id="iii.XLIV-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 5-9" id="iii.XLIV-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|13|5|13|9" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.5-Matt.13.9">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p47">A fourth part is saved; and not this all alike, but even
here great is the difference.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p48">Now these things He said, manifesting that He discoursed
to all without grudging. For as the sower makes no distinction in the
land submitted to him, but simply and indifferently casts his seed; so
He Himself too makes no distinction of rich and poor, of wise and
unwise, of slothful or diligent, of brave or cowardly; but He
discourses unto all, fulfilling His part, although foreknowing the
results; that it may be in His power to say, “What ought I to
have done, that I have not done?”<note n="1781" id="iii.XLIV-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p49"><scripRef passage="Is. v. 4" id="iii.XLIV-p49.1" parsed="|Isa|5|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.5.4">Is. v.

be quick and easier, and will presently yield its fruit.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p52">But when thou hearest, “The sower went forth to
sow,” think it not a needless repetition. For the sower
frequently goes forth for some other act also, either to plough, or to
cut out the evil herbs, or to pluck up thorns, or to attend to some
such matter; but He went forth to sow.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p53">Whence then, tell me, was the greater part of the seed
lost? Not through the sower, but through the ground that received it;
that is, the soul that did not hearken.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p54">And wherefore doth He not say, Some the careless
received, and lost it; some the rich, and choked it, and some the
superficial, and betrayed it? It is not His will to rebuke them
severely, lest He should cast them into despair, but He leaves the
reproof to the conscience of His hearers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p55">And this was not the case with the seed only, but also
with the net; for that too produced many that were unprofitable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p56">5. But this parable He speaks, as anointing His
disciples, and to teach them, that even though the lost be more than
such as receive the word yet they are not to despond. For this was the
ease even with their Lord, and He who fully foreknew that these things
should be, did not desist from sowing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p57">And how can it be reasonable, saith one, to sow among
the thorns, on the rock, on the wayside? With regard to the seeds and
the earth it cannot be reasonable; but in the case of men’s souls
and their instructions, it hath its praise, and that abundantly. For
the husbandman indeed would reasonably be blamed for doing this; it
being impossible for the rock to become earth, or the wayside not to be
a wayside, or the thorns, thorns; but in the things that have reason it
is not so. There is such a thing as the rock changing, and becoming
rich land; and the wayside being no longer trampled on, nor lying

<pb n="275" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_275.html" id="iii.XLIV-Page_275" />

open to all that pass by, but that it
may be a fertile field; and the thorns may be destroyed, and the seed
enjoy full security. For had it been impossible, this Sower would not
have sown. And if the change did not take place in all, this is no
fault of the Sower, but of them who are unwilling to be changed: He
having done His part: and if they betrayed what they received of Him,
He is blameless, the exhibitor of such love to man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p58">But do thou mark this, I pray thee; that the way of
destruction is not one only, but there are differing ones, and wide
apart from one another. For they that are like the wayside are the
coarse-minded,<note n="1784" id="iii.XLIV-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p59"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIV-p59.1">βναυσοι</span>.</p></note>and indifferent, and careless; but those on the rock such as fail from
weakness only.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p60">For “that which is sown upon the stony
places,” saith He, “the same is he that heareth the word,
and anon with joy receiveth it. Yet hath he not root in himself, but
dureth for a while; but when tribulation or persecution ariseth because
of the word, by and by he is offended! When any one,” so He
saith, “heareth the word of truth and understandeth it not, then
cometh the wicked one, and catcheth that which was sown out of his
heart. This is he that is sown by the wayside.”<note n="1785" id="iii.XLIV-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p61"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 20, 21, 19" id="iii.XLIV-p61.1" parsed="|Matt|13|20|13|21;|Matt|13|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.20-Matt.13.21 Bible:Matt.13.19">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p62">Now it is not the same thing for the doctrine to wither
away, when no man is evil entreating, or disturbing its foundations, as
when temptations press upon one. But they that are likened to the
thorns, are much more inexcusable than these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p63">6. In order then that none of these things may befall
us, let us by zeal and continual remembrance cover up the things that
are told us. For though the devil do catch them away, yet it rests with
us, whether they be caught away; though the plants wither, yet it is
not from the heat this takes place (for He did not say, because of the
heat it withered, but, “because it had no root”); although
His sayings are choked, it is not because of the thorns, but of them
who suffer them to spring up. For there is a way, if thou wilt, to
check this evil growth, and to make the right use of our wealth.
Therefore He said not, “the world,” but “the care of
the world;” nor “riches,” but “the
deceitfulness of riches.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p64">Let us not then blame the things, but the corrupt mind.
For it is possible to be rich and not to be deceived; and to be in this
world, and not to be choked with its cares. For indeed riches have two
contrary disadvantages; one, care, wearing us out, and bringing a
darkness over us; the other, luxury, making us effeminate.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p65">And well hath He said, “The deceitfulness of
riches.” For all that pertains to riches is deceit; they are
names only, not attached to things. For so pleasure and glory, and
splendid array, and all these things, are a sort of vain show, not a
reality.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p66">Having therefore spoken of the ways of destruction,
afterwards He mentions the good ground, not suffering them to despair,
but giving a hope of repentance, and indicating that it is possible to
change from the things before mentioned into this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p67">And yet if both the land be good, and the Sower one, and
the seed the same, wherefore did one bear a hundred, one sixty, one
thirty? Here again the difference is from the nature of the ground, for
even where the ground is good, great even therein is the difference.
Seest thou, that not the husbandman is to be blamed, nor the seed, but
the land that receives it? not for its nature, but for its disposition.
And herein too, great is His mercy to man, that He doth not require one
measure of virtue, but while He receives the first, and casts not out
the second, He gives also a place to the third.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p68">And these things He saith, least they that followed Him
should suppose that hearing is sufficient for salvation. And wherefore,
one may say, did He not put the other vices also, such as lust,
vainglory? In speaking of “the care of this world, and the
deceitfulness of riches,” He set down all. Yea, both vainglory
and all the rest belong to this world, and to the deceitfulness of
riches; such as pleasure, and gluttony, and envy, and vainglory, and
all the like.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p69">But He added also the “way” and the
“rock,” signifying that it is not enough to be freed from
riches only, but we must cultivate also the other parts of virtue. For
what if thou art free indeed from riches, yet are soft and unmanly? and
what if thou art not indeed unmanly, but art remiss and careless about
the hearing of the word? Nay, no one part is sufficient for our
salvation, but there is required first a careful hearing, and a
continual recollection; then fortitude, then contempt of riches, and
deliverance from all worldly things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p70">In fact, His reason for putting this before the other,
is because the one is first required (for “How shall they believe
except they hear?”<note n="1786" id="iii.XLIV-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p71"><scripRef passage="Rom. x. 14" id="iii.XLIV-p71.1" parsed="|Rom|10|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.10.14">Rom. x.

as to

<pb n="276" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_276.html" id="iii.XLIV-Page_276" />

learn what we ought to do):
after that, fortitude, and the contempt of things present.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p72">7. Hearing therefore these things, let us fortify
ourselves on all sides, regarding His instructions, and striking our
roots deep, and cleansing ourselves from all worldly things. But if we
do the one, neglecting the other, we shall be nothing bettered; for
though we perish not in one way, yet shall we in some other. For what
signifies our not being ruined by riches, if we are by indolence: or
not by indolence, if we are by softness. For so the husbandman, whether
this way or that way he lose his crop, equally bewails himself. Let us
not then soothe ourselves upon our not perishing in all these ways, but
let it be our grief, in whichever way we are perishing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p73">And let us burn up the thorns, for they choke the word.
And this is known to those rich men, who not for these matters alone,
but for others also prove unprofitable. For having become slaves and
captives of their pleasures, they are useless even for civil affairs,
and if for them, much more for those of Heaven. Yea, and in two ways
hereby our thoughts are corrupted; both by the luxury, and by the
anxiety too. For either of these by itself were enough to overwhelm the
bark; but when even both concur, imagine how high the billow
swells.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p74">And marvel not at His calling our luxury,
“thorns.” For thou indeed art not aware of it, being
intoxicated with thy passion, but they that are in sound health know
that it pricks sharper than any thorn, and that luxury wastes the soul
worse than care, and causes more grievous pains both to body and soul.
For one is not so sorely smitten by anxiety, as by surfeiting. Since
when watchings, and throbbings of the temples, and heaviness in the
head, and pangs of the bowels, lay hold of such a man, you may imagine
how many thorns these surpass in grievousness. And as the thorns, on
whichever side they are laid hold of, draw blood from the hands that
seize them, just so doth luxury plague both feet, and hands, and head,
and eyes, and in general all our members; and it is withered also, and
unfruitful, like the thorn, and hurts much more than it, and in our
vital parts. Yea, it brings on premature old age, and dulls the senses,
and darkens our reasoning, and blinds the keen-sighted mind, and makes
the body tumid,<note n="1787" id="iii.XLIV-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIV-p75"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIV-p75.1">πλαδαρν</span>.</p></note>rendering excessive the deposition of that which is cast away, and
gathering together a great accumulation of evils; and it makes the
burden too great, and the load overwhelming; whence our falls are many
and continual, and our shipwrecks frequent.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p76">For tell me, why pamper thy body? What? are we to slay
thee in sacrifice, to set thee on the table? The birds it is well for
thee to pamper: or rather, not so well even for them; for when they are
fattened, they are unprofitable for wholesome food. So great an evil is
luxury, that its mischief is shown even in irrational beings. For even
them by luxury we make unprofitable, both to themselves and to us. For
their superfluous flesh is indigestible, and the moister kind of
corruption is engendered by that kind of fatness. Whereas the creatures
that are not so fed, but live, as one may say, in abstinence, and
moderate diet, and in labor and hardship, these are most serviceable
both to themselves and to others, as well for food, as for everything
else. Those, at any rate, who live on them, are in better health; but
such as are fed on the others are like them, growing dull and sickly,
and rendering their chain more grievous. For nothing is so hostile and
hurtful to the body, as luxury; nothing so tears it in pieces, and
overloads and corrupts it, as intemperance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p77">Wherefore above all may this circumstance make one
amazed at them for their folly, that not even so much care as others
show towards their wine skins, are these willing to evince towards
themselves. For those the wine merchants do not allow to receive more
than is fit, lest they should burst; but to their own wretched belly
these men do not vouchsafe even so much forethought, but when they have
stuffed it and distended it, they fill all, up to the ears, up to the
nostrils, to the very throat itself, thereby pressing into half its
room the spirit, and the power that directs the living being. What? was
thy throat given thee for this end, that thou shouldest fill it up to
the very mouth, with wine turned sour, and all other corruption? Not
for this, O man, but that thou shouldest above all things sing to God,
and offer up the holy prayers, and read out the divine laws, and give
to thy neighbors profitable counsel. But thou, as if thou hadst
received it for this end, dost not suffer it to have leisure for that
ministry, so much as for a short season, but for all thy life
subjectest it to this evil slavery. And as if any man having had a lyre
given him with golden strings, and beautifully constructed, instead of
awakening with it the most harmonious music, were to cover it over with
much dung and clay; even so do these men. Now the word, dung, I use not
of living, but of luxurious living, and of that great wantonness.
Because what is more than necessary is not

<pb n="277" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_277.html" id="iii.XLIV-Page_277" />

nourishment, but merely injurious. For in truth
the belly alone was made merely for the reception of food; but the
month, and the throat, and tongue, for other things also, far more
necessary than these: or rather, not even the belly for the reception
of food simply, but for the reception of moderate food. And this it
makes manifest by crying out loudly against us, when we tease it by
this greediness; nor doth it clamor against us only, but also avenging
that wrong exacts of us the severest penalty. And first it punishes the
feet, that bear and conduct us to those wicked revels, then the hands
that minister to it, binding them together for having brought unto it
such quantities and kinds of provisions; and many have distorted even
their very mouth, and eyes, and head. And as a servant receiving an
order beyond his power, not seldom out of desperation becomes insolent
to the giver of the order: so the belly too, together with these
members, often ruins and destroys, from being over-strained, the very
brain itself. And this God hath well ordered, that from excess so much
mischief should arise; that when of thine own will thou dost not
practise self-restraint, at least against thy will, for fear of so
great ruin, thou mayest learn to be moderate.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIV-p78">Knowing then these things, let us flee luxury, let us
study moderation, that we may both enjoy health of body, and having
delivered our soul from all infirmity, may attain unto the good things
to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

that therefore free will is taken away; and this is evident from what
comes after. To this purpose, in order that neither the one sort may
despair, nor the other grow careless, upon being told that “it is
given,” He signifies the beginning to be with ourselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p14">“For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p16">And although the saying be full of much obscurity, yet
it indicates unspeakable justice. For what He saith is like this: When
any one hath forwardness and zeal, there shall be given unto him all
things on God’s part also: but if he be void of these, and
contribute not his own share, neither are God’s gifts bestowed.
For even “what he seemeth to have,” so He saith,
“shall be taken away from him;” God not so much taking it
away, as counting him unworthy of His gifts. This we also do; when we
see any one listening carelessly, and when with much entreaty we cannot
persuade him to attend, it remains for us to be silent. For if we are
still to go on, his carelessness is aggravated. But him that is
striving to learn, we lead on, and pour in much.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p17">And well said He, “Even that which he seemeth to
have.” For he hath not really even this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p18">Then He also made what He had said more distinct,
pointing out the meaning of, “To him that hath, shall be given,
but from him that hath not, even that which he seemeth to have, shall
be taken away.”</p>

were natural, it were meet to open them; but because it was a voluntary

see not,” but, “seeing, they see not;” so that the
blindness is of their own wickedness. For they saw even devils cast
out, and said, “By Beelzebub, prince of the devils, He casteth
out the devils.”<note n="1796" id="iii.XLV-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 14" id="iii.XLV-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.14">Matt. xii.

sight and hearing, therefore, saith He, the very hearing do I take away
from them. For they derive thence no advantage, but rather greater
condemnation. For they not only disbelieved, but found fault also, and
accused, and laid snares. However, He saith not this, for it is not His
will to give disgust in accusing them. Therefore neither at the
beginning did He so discourse to them, but with much plainness; but
because they perverted themselves, thenceforth He speaks in
parables.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p24">2. After this, lest any one should suppose His words to
be a mere accusation, and lest men should say, Being our enemy He is
bringing these charges and calumnies against us; He introduces the
prophet also, pronouncing the same judgment as Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p25">“For in them is fulfilled,” saith He,
“the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear,
and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not
perceive.”<note n="1798" id="iii.XLV-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p26"><scripRef passage="Matt. 13.14; Isa. 6.9,10" id="iii.XLV-p26.1" parsed="|Matt|13|14|0|0;|Isa|6|9|6|10" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.14 Bible:Isa.6.9-Isa.6.10">Matt. xiii. 14. See Is. vi. 9, 10</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p27">Seest thou the prophet likewise, accusing them with this
same accuracy? for neither did He say, Ye see not, but “Ye shall
see and not perceive;” nor again, Ye shall not hear, but
“Ye shall hear and not understand.” So that they first
inflicted the loss on themselves, by stopping their ears, by closing
their eyes, by making their heart fat. For they not only failed to
hear, but also “heard heavily,” and they did this, He
saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p28">“Lest at any time they should be converted, and I
should heal them;”<note n="1799" id="iii.XLV-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p29"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 15" id="iii.XLV-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|13|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.15">Matt. xiii.

from Him. And this He saith to draw them unto Him, and to provoke them,
and to signify that if they would convert<note n="1800" id="iii.XLV-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p30">[“turn again.”]</p></note> He would heal them: much as if one should say, “He would not look
at me, and I thank him; for if he had vouchsafed me this, I should
straightway have given in:” and this he saith, to signify how he
would have been reconciled. Even so then here too it is said,
“Lest at any time they should convert,<note n="1801" id="iii.XLV-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p31">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLV-p31.1">τ

possible, and that upon their repentance they might be saved, and that
not for His own glory, but for their salvation, He was doing all
things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p32">For if it had not been His will that they should hear
and be saved, He ought to have been silent, not to have spoken in
parables; but now by this very thing He stirs them up, even by speaking
under a veil. “For God willeth not the death of the sinner, but
that he should turn unto Him and live.”<note n="1802" id="iii.XLV-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p33"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xviii. 23" id="iii.XLV-p33.1" parsed="|Ezek|18|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.18.23">Ezek.

indeed these too were Jews, and brought up in the same circumstances;
but nevertheless they took no hurt from the prophecy, because they had
the root of His blessings well settled in them, their principle of
choice, I mean, and their judgment.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p36">Seest thou that, “unto you it is given,” was
not of necessity? For neither would

they have been blessed, unless the well-doing
had been their own. For tell me not this, that it was spoken obscurely;
for they might have come and asked Him, as the disciples did: but they
would not, being careless and supine. Why say I, they would not? nay,
they were doing the very opposite, not only disbelieving, not only not
hearkening, but even waging war, and disposed to be very bitter against
all He said: which He brings in the prophet laying to their charge, in
the words, “They heard heavily.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p37">But not such were these; wherefore He also blessed them.
And in another way too He assures them again, saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p38">“For verily I say unto you, many prophets and
righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not
heard them;”<note n="1804" id="iii.XLV-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 17" id="iii.XLV-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|13|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.17">Matt. xiii.
17</scripRef>.</p></note>my coming, He means; my very miracles, my voice, my teaching. For here
He prefers them not to these depraved only, but even to such as have
done virtuously; yea, and He affirms them to be more blessed even than
they. Why can this be? Because not only do these see what the Jews saw
not, but even what those of old desired to see. For they indeed beheld
by faith only: but these by sight too, and much more distinctly.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p40">Seest thou how again He connects the old dispensation
with the new, signifying that those of old not only knew the things to
come but also greatly desired them? But had they pertained to some
strange and opposing God, they would never have desired them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p41">“Hear ye therefore the parable of the
sower,”<note n="1805" id="iii.XLV-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 18" id="iii.XLV-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|13|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.18">Matt. xiii.

attention, of cowardice and fortitude, of wealth and voluntary poverty;
pointing out the hurt from the one, and the benefit from the other.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p43">Then of virtue also He brings forward different forms.
For being full of love to man, He marked out not one only way, nor did
He say, “unless one bring forth an hundred, he is an
outcast;” but he that brings forth sixty is saved also, and not
he only, but also the producer of thirty. And this He said, making out
salvation to be easy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p44">3. And thou then, art thou unable to practise virginity?
Be chaste in marriage. Art thou unable to strip thyself of thy
possessions? Give of thy substance. Canst thou not bear that burden?
Share thy goods with Christ. Art thou unwilling to yield Him up all?
Give Him but the half, but the third part. He is thy brother, and
joint-heir, make Him joint-heir with thee here too. Whatsoever thou
givest Him, thou wilt give to thyself. Hearest thou not what saith the
prophet? “Them that pertain to thy seed thou shalt not
overlook.”<note n="1806" id="iii.XLV-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p45"><scripRef passage="Isa. lviii. 7" id="iii.XLV-p45.1" parsed="|Isa|58|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.58.7">Isa. lviii.

towards thee, together with His authority as Lord, the claim also of
kindred, and many more besides. Yea, for He too hath made thee a sharer
in His goods, having received nothing of thee, but having begun with
this unspeakable benefit. What then can it be but extreme
senselessness, not even by this gift to be made kind towards men, not
even to give a return for a free gift, and less things for greater?
Thus whereas He hath made thee heir of Heaven, impartest thou not to
Him even of the things on earth? He, when thou hadst done no good work,
but wert even an enemy, reconciled thee: and dost thou not requite Him,
being even a friend and benefactor?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p46">Yet surely, even antecedently to the kingdom, and to all
the rest, even for the very fact of His giving, we ought to feel bound
to Him. For so servants too, when bidding their masters to a meal,
account themselves not to be giving but receiving; but here the
contrary hath taken place: not the servant the Lord, but the Lord hath
first bidden the servant unto His own table; and dost thou not bid Him,
no not even after this? He first hath introduced thee under His own
roof; dost thou not take Him in, so much as in the second place? He
clad thee, being naked; and dost thou not even after this receive Him
being a stranger? He first gave thee to drink out of His own cup, and
dost thou not impart to Him so much as cold water? He hath made thee
drink of the Holy Spirit, and dost thou not even soothe His bodily
thirst? He hath made thee drink of the Spirit, when thou wast deserving
of punishment; and dost thou neglect Him even when thirsty, and this
when it is out of His own, that thou art to do all these things? Dost
thou not then esteem it a great thing, to hold the cup out of which
Christ is to drink, and to put it to His lips? Seest thou not that for
the priest alone is it lawful<note n="1807" id="iii.XLV-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLV-p47"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLV-p47.1">θμι</span>.</p></note>to give the cup of His blood? But I am by no means strict about this,
saith He; but though thyself should give, I receive; though thou be a
layman, I refuse it not. And I do not require such as I have given: for
not blood do I seek, but cold water. Consider to whom thou art giving
drink, and tremble. Consider, thou art become a priest of Christ,
giv

<pb n="280" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_280.html" id="iii.XLV-Page_280" />

ing with thine own hand, not
flesh but bread, not blood, but a cup of cold water. He clothed thee
with a garment of salvation, and clothed thee by Himself; do thou at
least by thy servant clothe Him. He made thee glorious in Heaven, do
thou deliver Him from shivering, and nakedness, and shame. He made thee
a fellow-citizen of angels, do thou impart to Him at least of the
covering of thy roof, give house-room to Him at least as to thine own
servant. “I refuse not this lodging and that, having opened to
thee the whole Heaven. I have delivered thee from a most grievous
prison; this I do not require again, nor do I say, deliver me; but if
thou wouldest look upon me only, when I am bound, this suffices me for
refreshment. When thou wert dead, I raised thee; I require not this
again of thee, but I say, visit me only when sick.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p48">Now when His gifts are so great, and His demands
exceeding easy, and we do not supply even these; what deep of hell must
we not deserve? Justly shall we depart into the fire that is prepared
for the devil and his angels, being more insensible than any rock. For
how great insensibility is it, tell me, for us, who have received, and
are to receive so much, to be slaves of money, from which we shall a
little while hence be separated even against our will? And others
indeed have given up even their life, and shed their blood; and dost
thou not even give up thy superfluities for Heaven’s sake, for
the sake of so great crowns?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p49">And of what favor canst thou be worthy? of what
justification? who in thy sowing of the earth, gladly pourest forth
all, and in lending to men at usury sparest nothing; but in feeding thy
Lord through His poor art cruel and inhuman?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p50">Having then considered all these things, and calculated
what we have received, what we are to receive, what is required of us,
let us show forth all our diligence on the things spiritual. Let us
become at length mild and humane, that we may not draw down on
ourselves the intolerable punishment. For what is there that hath not
power to condemn us? Our having enjoyed so many and such great
benefits; our having no great thing required of us; our having such
things required, as we shall leave here even against our will; our
exhibiting so much liberality in our worldly matters. Why each one of
these, even by itself, were enough to condemn us; but when they all
meet together, what hope will there be of salvation?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLV-p51">In order then that we may escape all this condemnation,
let us show forth some bounty towards those who are in need. For thus
shall we enjoy all the good things, both here, and there; unto which
may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c53" id="iii.XLVI-p3"><i>“Another parable put He forth unto them,
saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good
seed in his field. But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares
among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up,
and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares. So the servants of
the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good
seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An
enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that
we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest while ye gather up the
tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both therefore grow
together until the harvest.”</i><note n="1808" id="iii.XLVI-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p4">[The citation agrees exactly with the Received text;

editors.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.XLVI-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.XLVI-p5.1">What</span> is the difference between
this, and the parable before it? There He speaks of them that have not
at all holden with Him, but have started aside, and have thrown away
the seed; but here He means the societies of the heretics. For in order
that not even this might disturb His disciples, He foretells it

<pb n="281" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_281.html" id="iii.XLVI-Page_281" />

also, after having taught them why He
speaks in parables. The former parable then means their not receiving
Him; this, their receiving corrupters. For indeed this also is a part
of the devil’s craft, by the side of the truth always to bring in
error, painting thereon many resemblances, so as easily to cheat the
deceivable. Therefore He calls it not any other seed, but tares; which
in appearance are somewhat like wheat.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p6">Then He mentions also the manner of his device. For
“while men slept,” saith He. It is no small danger, which
He hereby suspends over our rulers, to whom especially is entrusted the
keeping of the field; and not the rulers only, but the subjects
too.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p7">And He signifies also that the error comes after the
truth, which the actual event testifies. For so after the prophets,
were the false prophets; and after the apostles, the false apostles;
and after Christ, Antichrist. For unless the devil see what to imitate,
or against whom to plot, he neither attempts, nor knows how. Now then
also, having seen that “one brought forth a hundred, another
sixty, another thirty,” he proceeds after that another way. That
is, not having been able to carry away what had taken root, nor to
choke, nor to scorch it up, he conspires against it by another craft,
privily casting in his own inventions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p8">And what difference is there, one may say, between them
that sleep, and them that resemble the wayside? That in the latter case
he immediately caught it away; yea, he suffered it not even to take
root; but here more of his craft was needed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p9">And these things Christ saith, instructing us to be
always wakeful. For, saith He, though thou quite escape those harms,
there is yet another harm. For as in those instances “the
wayside,” and “the rock,” and “the
thorns,” so here again sleep occasions our ruin; so that there is
need of continual watchfulness. Wherefore He also said, “He that
endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.”<note n="1809" id="iii.XLVI-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 22" id="iii.XLVI-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|10|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.22">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p11">Something like this took place even at the beginning.
Many of the prelates, I mean, bringing into the churches wicked men,
disguised heresiarchs, gave great facility to the laying that kind of
snare. For the devil needs not even to take any trouble, when he hath
once planted them among us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p12">And how is it possible not to sleep? one may say.
Indeed, as to natural sleep, it is not possible; but as to that of our
moral faculty, it is possible. Wherefore Paul also said, “Watch
ye, stand fast in the faith.”<note n="1810" id="iii.XLVI-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p13"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xvi. 13" id="iii.XLVI-p13.1" parsed="|1Cor|16|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.16.13">1 Cor. xvi.
13</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p14">After this He points out the thing to be superfluous
too, not hurtful only; in that, after the land hath been tilled, and
there is no need of anything, then this enemy sows again; as the
heretics also do, who for no other cause than vainglory inject their
proper venom.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p15">And not by this only, but by what follows likewise, He
depicts exactly all their acting. For, “When the blade was sprung
up,” saith He, “and brought forth fruit, then appeared the
tares also;” which kind of thing these men also do. For at the
beginning they disguise themselves; but when they have gained much
confidence, and some one imparts to them the teaching of the word, then
they pour out their poison.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p16">But wherefore doth He bring in the servants, telling
what hath been done? That He may pronounce it wrong to slay them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p17">And He calls him “an enemy,” because of his
harm done to men. For although the despite is against us, in its origin
it sprang from his enmity, not to us, but to God. Whence it is
manifest, that God loves us more than we love ourselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p18">And see from another thing also, the malicious craft of
the devil. For he did not sow before this, because he had nothing to
destroy, but when all had been fulfilled, that he might defeat the
diligence of the Husbandman; in such enmity against Him did he
constantly act.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p19">And mark also the affection of the servants. I mean,
what haste they are in at once to root up the tares, even though they
do it indiscreetly; which shows their anxiety for the crop, and that
they are looking to one thing only, not to the punishment of that
enemy, but to the preservation of the seed sown. For of course this
other is not the urgent consideration.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p20">Wherefore how they may for the present extirpate the
mischief, this is their object. And not even this do they seek
absolutely, for they trust not themselves with it, but await the
Master’s decision, saying, “Wilt Thou?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p21">What then doth the Master? He forbids them, saying,
“Lest haply ye root up the wheat with them.” And this He
said, to hinder wars from arising, and blood and slaughter. For it is
not right to put a heretic to death, since an implacable war would be
brought into the world. By these two reasons then He restrains them;
one, that the wheat be not hurt; another, that punishment will surely
overtake them, if incurably diseased. Wherefore, if thou wouldest have
them punished, yet without harm to the wheat, I bid thee wait for the
proper season.</p>

<pb n="282" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_282.html" id="iii.XLVI-Page_282" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p22">But what means, “Lest ye root up the wheat with
them?” Either He means this, If ye are to take up arms, and to
kill the heretics, many of the saints also must needs be overthrown
with them; or that of the very tares it is likely that many may change
and become wheat. If therefore ye root them up beforehand, ye injure
that which is to become wheat, slaying some, in whom there is yet room
for change and improvement. He doth not therefore forbid our checking
heretics, and stopping their mouths, and taking away their freedom of
speech, and breaking up their assemblies and confederacies, but our
killing and slaying them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p23">But mark thou His gentleness, how He not only gives
sentence and forbids, but sets down reasons.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p24">What then, if the tares should remain until the end?
“Then I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them.”<note n="1811" id="iii.XLVI-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p25"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 30" id="iii.XLVI-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|13|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.30">Matt. xiii.

wheat, we must spare them, for it is possible for them even to become
wheat but when they have departed, having profited nothing, then of
necessity the inexorable punishment will overtake them. “For I
will say to the reapers,” saith He, “Gather ye together
first the tares.” Why, “first?” That these may not be
alarmed, as though the wheat were carried off with them. “And
bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my
barn.”<note n="1813" id="iii.XLVI-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p27">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVI-p27.1">μου</span> is
omitted from the text of the Homily.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p28">2. “Another parable put He forth unto them,
saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is like to a grain of mustard
seed.”<note n="1814" id="iii.XLVI-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p29">[<scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 31" id="iii.XLVI-p29.1" parsed="|Matt|13|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.31">Matt.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p30">That is, since He had said, that of the crop three parts
are lost, and but one saved, and in the very part again which is saved
so great damage ensues; lest they should say, “And who, and how
many will be the faithful?” this fear again He removes, by the
parable of the mustard seed leading them on to belief, and signifying
that in any case the gospel<note n="1815" id="iii.XLVI-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p31"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVI-p31.1">κρυγμα</span>.</p></note>shall be spread abroad.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p32">Therefore He brought forward the similitude of this
herb, which has a very strong resemblance to the subject in hand;
“Which indeed is the least,” He saith, “of all seeds,
but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a
tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches
thereof.”<note n="1816" id="iii.XLVI-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 31, 32" id="iii.XLVI-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|13|31|13|32" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.31-Matt.13.32">Matt. xiii.

than all,” “is greater than.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p34">Thus He meant to set forth the most decisive sign of its
greatness. “Even so then shall it be with respect to the gospel
too,” saith He. Yea, for His disciples were weakest of all, and
least of all; but nevertheless, because of the great power that was in
them, It hath been unfolded<note n="1817" id="iii.XLVI-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p35"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVI-p35.1">ἐξηπλθη</span>.</p></note>in every part of the world.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p36">After this He adds the leaven to this similitude,
saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p37">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven, which
a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was
leavened.”<note n="1818" id="iii.XLVI-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 33" id="iii.XLVI-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|13|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.33">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p39">For as this converts the large quantity of meal into its
own quality,<note n="1819" id="iii.XLVI-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p40"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVI-p40.1">ἰσχν</span>.</p></note>even so shall ye convert the whole world.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p41">And see His wisdom, in that He brings in things natural,
implying that as the one cannot fail to take place, so neither the
other. For say not this to me: “What shall we be able to do,
twelve men, throwing ourselves upon so vast a multitude?” Nay,
for this very thing most of all makes your might conspicuous, that ye
mix with the multitude and are not put to flight. As therefore the
leaven then leavens the lump when it comes close to the meal, and not
simply close, but so as to be actually mixed with it (for He said not,
“put,” simply, but “hid”); so also ye, when ye
cleave to your enemies, and are made one with them, then shall ye get
the better of them. And as the leaven, though it be buried, yet is not
destroyed, but by little and little transmutes all into its own
condition; of like sort will the event be here also, with respect to
the gospel. Fear ye not then, because I said there would be much
injurious dealing: for even so shall ye shine forth, and get the better
of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p42">But by “three measures,” here, He meant
many, for He is wont to take this number for a multitude.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p43">And marvel not, if discoursing about the kingdom, He
made mention of a little seed and of leaven; for He was discoursing
with men inexperienced and ignorant, and such as needed to be led on by
those means. For so simple were they, that even after all this, they
required a good deal of explanation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p44">Where now are the children of the Greeks? Let them learn
Christ’s power, seeing the verity of His deeds, and on either
ground let them adore Him, that He both foretold so great a thing, and
fulfilled it. Yea, for it is He that put the power into the leaven.
With

<pb n="283" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_283.html" id="iii.XLVI-Page_283" />

this intent He mingled also
with the multitude those who believe on Him, that we might impart unto
the rest of our wisdom. Let no one therefore reprove us for being few.
For great is the power of the gospel, and that which hath been once
leavened, becomes leaven again for what remains. And as a spark, when
it hath caught in timber, makes what hath been burnt up already
increase the flame, and so proceeds to the rest; even so the gospel
likewise. But He said not fire, but “leaven.” Why might
this be? Because in that case the whole effect is not of the fire, but
partly of the timber too that is kindled, but in this the leaven doth
the whole work by itself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p45">3. Now if twelve men leavened the whole world, imagine
how great our baseness, in that when we being so many are not able to
amend them that remain; we, who ought to be enough for ten thousand
worlds, and to become leaven to them. “But they,” one may
say, “were apostles.” And what then? Were they not
partakers with thee? Were they not brought up in cities? Did they not
enjoy the same benefits? Did they not practise trades? What, were they
angels? What, came they down from Heaven?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p46">“But they had signs,” it will be said. It
was not the signs that made them admirable. How long shall we use those
miracles as cloaks for our own remissness? <i>Behold the choir of the
Saints, that they shone not by those miracles</i>.<note n="1820" id="iii.XLVI-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p47">This sentence is printed in italics, as not

iniquity, instead of being admired, did even incur punishment.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p48">And what can it be then, he will say, that showed them
great? Their contempt of wealth, their despising glory, their freedom
from worldly things. Since surely, had they wanted these qualities, and
been slaves of their passions, though they had raised ten thousand
dead, so far from doing any good, they would even have been accounted
deceivers. Thus it is their life, so bright on all sides, which also
draws down the grace of the Spirit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p49">What manner of miracle did John work, that he fixed on
himself the attention<note n="1821" id="iii.XLVI-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVI-p50.1">ἀνηρτσατο</span>.</p></note>of so many cities? For as to the fact that he did no wondrous works,

towards the king? from his zeal towards God? from his voluntary
poverty? from his garment of sheep’s skin, and his cave, and his
mountains? For his miracles he did after all these. And as to Job, what
manner of miracle did he work in sight of the devil, that he was amazed
at him? No miracle indeed, but a life that shone and displayed an
endurance firmer than any adamant. What manner of miracle did David,
yet being young, that God should say, “I have found David the son
of Jesse, a man after mine own heart?”<note n="1823" id="iii.XLVI-p51.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p52"><scripRef passage="Acts xiii. 22" id="iii.XLVI-p52.1" parsed="|Acts|13|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.13.22">Acts xiii.

be sober, do even harm in many cases? Thus many of the Corinthians were
severed one from another; thus many of the Romans were carried away
with pride; thus was Simon cast out. Thus he, who at a certain time had
a desire to follow Christ, was rejected, when he had been told,
“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests.”<note n="1824" id="iii.XLVI-p52.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p53"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 20" id="iii.XLVI-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.20">Matt. viii.

take it away when it exists.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p54">And Himself too, when He was making laws for His own
disciples, what said He? “Do miracles, that men may see

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p57">Whence then had these the advantage? From the virtue in
their soul. Seest thou how everywhere practice is required, and the
proof by works? “For by their fruits,” saith He, “ye
shall know them.”<note n="1827" id="iii.XLVI-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p58"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 16" id="iii.XLVI-p58.1" parsed="|Matt|7|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.16">Matt. vii.

the perfection of an excellent conversation? Very evidently it is the
second; but as to the miracles, they both have their origin from hence,
and terminate herein. For both he that shows forth an excellent life,
draws to himself this gift, and he that receives the gift, receives it
for this end, that he may amend other men’s lives.

<pb n="284" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_284.html" id="iii.XLVI-Page_284" />

Since even Christ for this end wrought those
miracles, that having made Himself thereby credible, and drawn men unto
Him, He might bring virtue into our life. Wherefore also He lays more
stress of the two on this. For He is not at all satisfied with the
signs only, but He also threatens hell, and promises a kingdom, and
lays down those startling laws, and all things He orders to this end,
that He may make us equal to the angels.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p59">And why say I, that Christ doth all for this object?
Why, even thou, should one give thee thy choice, to raise dead men by
His name, or to die for His name; which I pray thee, of the two
wouldest thou rather accept? Is it not quite plain, the latter? and yet
the one is a miracle, the other but a work. And what, if one offered
thee to make grass gold, or to be able to despise all wealth as grass,
wouldest thou not rather accept this latter? and very reasonably. For
mankind would be attracted by this more than any way. For if they saw
the grass changed into gold, they would covet themselves also to
acquire that power, as Simon did, and the love of money would be
increased in them; but if they saw us all contemning and neglecting
gold, as though it were grass, they would long ago have been delivered
from this disease.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p60">4. Seest thou that our practice has more power to do
good? By practice I mean, not thy fasting, nor yet thy strewing
sackcloth and ashes under thee, but if thou despise wealth, as it ought
to be despised; if thou be kindly affectioned, if thou give thy bread
to the hungry, if thou control anger, if thou cast out vainglory, if
thou put away envy. So He Himself used to teach: for, “Learn of

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p64">And all this I say, not to depreciate fasting, God
forbid, but rather highly to commend it. But I grieve when other duties
being neglected, ye think it enough for salvation, having but the last
place in the choir of virtue. For the greatest thing is charity, and
moderation, and almsgiving; which hits a higher mark even than
virginity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p65">Wherefore, if thou desire to become equal to the
apostles, there is nothing to hinder thee. For to have arrived at this
virtue only suffices for thy not at all falling short of them. Let no
one therefore wait for miracles.<note n="1831" id="iii.XLVI-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p66"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVI-p66.1">ἀναβαλλσθω ε

this is his great power.<note n="1832" id="iii.XLVI-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p67"><scripRef passage="Acts viii. 10" id="iii.XLVI-p67.1" parsed="|Acts|8|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.10">Acts viii.

for this brought in death; by reason of this all things have been
turned upside down. If then thou remove this, thou hast cut out the
nerves of the devil, thou hast “bruised his head,” thou
hast put an end to all his might, thou hast scattered his host, thou
hast exhibited a sign greater than all signs.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p68">The saying is not mine, but the blessed Paul’s.
For when he had said, “Covet earnestly the best gifts, and yet
show I unto you a more excellent way;”<note n="1833" id="iii.XLVI-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p69"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xii. 31" id="iii.XLVI-p69.1" parsed="|1Cor|12|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.12.31">1 Cor. xii.

of all our good things. If then we practise this, and all the
self-denial that flows from it, we shall have no need of signs; even as
on the other hand, if we do not practise it, we shall gain nothing by
the signs.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVI-p70">Bearing in mind then all this, let us imitate those
things whereby the apostles became great. And whereby did they become
great? Hear Peter, saying, “Behold we have forsaken all, and
followed Thee; what shall we have therefore?”<note n="1834" id="iii.XLVI-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVI-p71"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 27" id="iii.XLVI-p71.1" parsed="|Matt|19|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.27">Matt. xix.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p9">Then pointing out that He is not making a new thing, He
brings in the Prophet also, proclaiming beforehand this His manner of
teaching. And to teach us the purpose of Christ, how He discoursed in
this manner, not that they might be ignorant, but that He might lead
them to inquiry, he added, “And without a parable spake He
nothing unto them.” Yet surely He did say many things without a
parable; but then nothing. And for all this no man asked Him questions,
whereas the Prophets, we know, they were often questioning: as
Ezekiel,<note n="1840" id="iii.XLVII-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p10"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xii. 9, xxiv. 19, xxxvii. 18" id="iii.XLVII-p10.1" parsed="|Ezek|12|9|0|0;|Ezek|24|19|0|0;|Ezek|37|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.12.9 Bible:Ezek.24.19 Bible:Ezek.37.18">Ezek. xii.

His sayings were enough to cast them into perplexity, and to stir them
up to the inquiry; for indeed a very sore punishment was threatened by
those parables: however, not even so were they moved.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p11">Wherefore also He left them and went away. For,</p>

been told, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of Heaven;” and they were emboldened. Wherefore also they
ask in private; not as grudging the multitude, but observing their
Master’s law. For, “To these,” saith He, “it is
not given.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p20">And why may it be that they let pass the parable of the
leaven, and of the mustard seed, and inquire concerning this? They let
those pass, as being plainer; but about this, as having an affinity to
that before spoken, and as setting forth something more than it, they
are desirous to learn (since He would not have spoken the same to them
a second time); for indeed they saw how severe was the threatening
therein uttered.<note n="1846" id="iii.XLVII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p21">This passage is translated according to a
conjectural emendation of Mr. Field. [The Greek text seems to be
corrupt here. The <span class="c20" id="iii.XLVII-p21.1">mss</span>. readings yield no
intelligible sense that can be considered correct.—R.]</p></note> Wherefore neither doth He blame them, but rather completes His previous
statements.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p22">And, as I am always saying, the parables must not be
explained throughout word for word, since many absurdities will follow;
this even He Himself is teaching us here in thus interpreting this
parable. Thus He saith not at all who the servants are that came to
Him, but, implying that He brought them in, for the sake of some order,
and to make up the picture, He omits that part, and interprets those
that are most urgent and essential, and for the sake of which the
parable was spoken; signifying Himself to be Judge and Lord of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p23">“And He answered,” so it is said, “and
said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man; the
field is the world, the good seed, these are the children of the
kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy
that soweth them is the devil; and the harvest is the end of the world,
and the reapers are angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and
burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of
Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all
things that offend, and them which do iniquity;<note n="1847" id="iii.XLVII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p24">Or, “produce lawlessness,” <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVII-p24.1">το ποιοντα

the present world also is His.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p27">But mark His unspeakable love to man, and His leaning to
bounty, and His disinclination to punishment; in that, when He sows, He
sows in His own person, but when He punishes, it is by others, that is,
by the angels.</p>

in the kingdom of their Father.” Not because it will be just so
much only, but because this star is surpassed in brightness by none
that we know. He uses the comparisons that are known to us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p29">And yet surely elsewhere He saith, the harvest is
already come; as when He saith of the Samaritans, “Lift up your
eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to
harvest.”<note n="1849" id="iii.XLVII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p30"><scripRef passage="John iv. 35" id="iii.XLVII-p30.1" parsed="|John|4|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.35">John iv.

He said, it is yet to be? According to another signification.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p32">And how having elsewhere said, “One soweth, and
another reapeth,”<note n="1851" id="iii.XLVII-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p33"><scripRef passage="John iv. 37" id="iii.XLVII-p33.1" parsed="|John|4|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.37">John iv.
37</scripRef>.</p></note>doth He here say, it is Himself that soweth? Because there again, He
was speaking, to distinguish the apostles, not from Himself, but from
the prophets, and that in the case of the Jews and Samaritans. Since
certainly it was He who sowed through the prophets also.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p34">And at times He calls this self-same thing both harvest
and sowing, naming it with relation, now to one thing, now to another.
Thus when He is speaking of the conviction and obedience of His
converts,<note n="1852" id="iii.XLVII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p35"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVII-p35.1">ὑπακουσντων</span>
.</p></note> He calls the thing “a harvest,” as though He had
accomplished all; but when He is seeking after the fruit of their
hearing, He calls it seed, and the end, harvest.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p36">And how saith He elsewhere, that “the righteous
are caught up first?”<note n="1853" id="iii.XLVII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p37"><scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 17" id="iii.XLVII-p37.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.17">1 Thess.

others are given over to punishment, and then the former depart into
the kingdom of heaven. For because they must be in heaven, but He
Himself is to come and judge all men here; having passed sentence upon
these, like some king He rises with His friends, leading them to that
blessed portion. Seest thou that the punishment is twofold, first to be
burnt up, and then to fall from that glory?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p38">2. But wherefore doth He still go on, when the others
have withdrawn, to speak to these also in parables? They had become
wiser by His sayings, so as even to understand. At any rate, to them He
saith afterwards,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p39">“Have ye understood all these things? They say
unto Him, Yea, Lord.”<note n="1854" id="iii.XLVII-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 51" id="iii.XLVII-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|13|51|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.51">Matt. xiii.

this too, that it made them more clear sighted. What then saith He
again?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p41">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hid
in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
thereof selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the
Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls,
who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that
he had, and bought it.”<note n="1855" id="iii.XLVII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p42"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 44-46" id="iii.XLVII-p42.1" parsed="|Matt|13|44|13|46" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.44-Matt.13.46">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p43">Much as in the other place, the mustard seed and the
leaven have but some little difference from each other, so here also
these two parables, that of the treasure and that of the pearl. This
being of course signified by both, that we ought to value the gospel
above all things. And the former indeed, of the leaven and of the
mustard seed, was spoken with a view to the power of the gospel, and to
its surely prevailing over the world; but these declare its value, and
great price. For as it extends itself like mustard seed, and prevails
like leaven, so it is precious like a pearl, and affords full abundance
like a treasure. We are then to learn not this only, that we ought to
strip ourselves of everything else, and cling to the gospel, but also
that we are to do so with joy; and when a man is dispossessing himself
of his goods, he is to know that the transaction is gain, and not
loss.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p44">Seest thou how both the gospel is hid in the world, and
the good things in the gospel?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p45">Except thou sell all, thou buyest not; except thou have
such a soul, anxious and inquiring, thou findest not. Two things
therefore are requisite, abstinence from worldly matters, and
watchfulness. For He saith “One seeking goodly pearls, who when
he had found one of great price, sold all and bought it.” For the
truth is one, and not in many divisions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p46">And much as he that hath the pearl knows

<pb n="287" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_287.html" id="iii.XLVII-Page_287" />

indeed himself that he is rich, but others know
not, many times, that he is holding it in his hand (for there is no
corporeal bulk); just so also with the gospel, they that have hold of
it know that they are rich, but the unbelievers, not knowing of this
treasure, are in ignorance also of our wealth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p47">3. After this, that we may not be confident in the
gospel merely preached, nor think that faith only suffices us for
salvation, He utters also another, an awful parable. Which then is
this? That of the net.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p48">“For the kingdom of Heaven is like unto a net,
that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind; which, when it
was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into
vessels, but cast the bad away.”<note n="1856" id="iii.XLVII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVII-p49"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 47, 48" id="iii.XLVII-p49.1" parsed="|Matt|13|47|13|48" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.47-Matt.13.48">Matt. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p50">And wherein doth this differ from the parable of the
tares? For there too the one are saved, the other perish; but there,
for choosing of wicked doctrines; and those before this again, for not
giving heed to His sayings, but these for wickedness of life; who are
the most wretched of all, having attained to His knowledge, and being
caught, but not even so capable of being saved.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVII-p51">Yet surely He saith elsewhere, that the shepherd Himself

almsgiving it cannot be. For this is among the things that are
essential, and hold all together. Not unnaturally then have we called
it the heart of virtue. But this heart, unless it supply breath to all,
is soon extinguished. In the same way then as the fountain also, if it
confine its streams to itself, grows putrid; so it is with the rich
also, when they keep their possessions to themselves. Wherefore even in

the abundance, great the treasure.” For in truth there is a
consumption, not of the possessors only, but of the riches themselves.
Since both garments laid by spoil, and gold is cankered, and corn is
eaten up, and the soul too of their owner is more than they all
cankered and corrupted by the cares of them.</p>

feeling of wonder towards Him was gaining ground (for indeed even there
He was marvelled at), wherefore did He not do them? Because He looked
not to the display of Himself, but to their profit. Therefore when this
succeeded not, He overlooked what concerned Himself, in order not to
aggravate their punishment.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p21">And yet see after how long a time He came to them, and
after how great a display of miracles: but not even so did they endure
it, but were inflamed again with envy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p22">Wherefore then did He yet do a few miracles? That they
might not say, “Physician, heal thyself.”<note n="1892" id="iii.XLVIII-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p23"><scripRef passage="Luke iv. 23" id="iii.XLVIII-p23.1" parsed="|Luke|4|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.4.23">Luke iv.

overlooks His own;” that they might not say, “If miracles
had been wrought, we also should have believed.” Therefore He
both wrought them, and stayed: the one, that He might fulfill His own
part; the other, that He might not condemn them the more.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p24">And consider thou the power of His words, herein at
least, that possessed as they were by envy, they did yet admire. And as
with regard to His works, they do not find fault with what is done, but
feign causes which have no existence, slaying, “In Beelzebub He
casteth out the devils;” even so here too, they find no fault
with the teaching, but take refuge in the meanness of His race.</p>

gentleness, how He reviles them not, but with great mildness saith,
“A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country.”

own brethren, He made this addition.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p35">But yet even this opinion savored of the soldier, and
was absurd. For many besides had risen from the dead, and no one had
wrought anything of the kind. And his words seem to me to be the
language both of vanity, and of fear. For such is the nature of
unreasonable souls, they admit often a mixture of opposite
passions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p36">But Luke affirms that the multitudes said, “This

that said He was John (for many had said this too), he had denied it,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p57">Her reproach is twofold; first, that she danced, then
that she pleased him, and so pleased him, as to obtain even murder for
her reward.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p58">Seest thou how savage he was? how senseless? how
foolish? in putting himself under the obligation of an oath, while to
her he gives full power over her request. But when he saw the evil
actually ensuing, “he was sorry,”<note n="1908" id="iii.XLVIII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p59"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiii. 9" id="iii.XLVIII-p59.1" parsed="|Matt|13|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.13.9">Matt. xiii.

grieved.”]</p></note>it is said; and yet in the first instance he had put him in bonds.
Wherefore then is he sorry? Such is the nature of virtue, even amongst
the wicked admiration and praises are its due. But alas for her
madness! When she too ought to admire, yea, to bow down to him, for
trying to redress her wrong, she on the contrary even helps to arrange
the plot, and lays a snare, and asks a diabolical favor.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p60">But he was afraid “for the oath’s
sake,” it is said, “and them that sat at meat with
him.” And how didst thou not fear that which is more grievous?
Surely if thou wast afraid to have witnesses of thy perjury, much more
oughtest thou to fear having so many witnesses of a murder so
lawless.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p61">But as I think many are ignorant of the grievance
itself, whence the murder had its origin, I must declare this too, that
ye may learn the wisdom of the lawgiver. What then was the ancient law,
which Herod indeed trampled on, but John vindicated? The wife of him
that died childless was to be given to his brother.<note n="1909" id="iii.XLVIII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p62"><scripRef passage="Deut. xxv. 5" id="iii.XLVIII-p62.1" parsed="|Deut|25|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.25.5">Deut. xxv.
5</scripRef>.</p></note> For since death was an incurable ill, and all was contrived for
life’s sake; He makes a law that the living brother should marry
her, and should call the child that is born by the name of the dead, so
that his house should not utterly perish. For if the dead were not so
much as to leave children, which is the greatest mitigation of death,
the sorrow would be without remedy. Therefore you see, the lawgiver
devised this refreshment for those who were by nature deprived of
children, and commanded the issue to be reckoned as belonging to the
other.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p63">But when there was a child, this marriage was no longer
permitted. “And wherefore?” one may say, “for if it
was lawful for another, much more for the brother.” By no means.
For He will have men’s consanguinity extended, and the sources
multiplied of our interest in each other.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p64">Why then, in the case also of death without offspring,
did not another marry her? Because it would not so be accounted the
child of the departed; but now his brother begetting it, the fiction
became probable. And besides, any other man had no constraining call to
build up the house of the dead, but this had incurred the claim by
relationship.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p65">Forasmuch then as Herod had married his brother’s
wife, when she had a child, therefore John blames him, and blames him
with moderation, showing together with his boldness, his consideration
also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p66">But mark thou, I pray thee, how the whole theatre was
devilish. For first, it was made up of drunkenness and luxury, whence
nothing healthful could come. Secondly, the spectators in it were
depraved, and he that gave the banquet the worst transgressor of all.
Thirdly, there was the irrational pleasure. Fourthly, the damsel,
because of whom the marriage was illegal, who ought even to have hid
herself, as though her mother were dishonored by her, comes making a
show, and throwing into the shade all harlots, virgin as she was.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p67">And the time again contributes no little to the reproof
of this enormity. For when he ought to be thanking God, that on that
day He had brought him to light, then he ventures upon those lawless
acts. When one in chains ought to have been freed by him, then he adds
slaughter to bonds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p68">Hearken, ye virgins, or rather ye wives also, as many as
consent to such unseemliness at other person’s weddings, leaping,
and bounding, and disgracing our common nature. Hearken, ye men too, as
many as follow after those banquets, full of expense and drunkenness,
and fear ye the gulf of the evil one. For indeed so mightily did he
seize upon that wretched person just then, that he sware even to give
the half of his kingdom: this being Mark’s statement, “He
sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee,
unto the half of my kingdom.”<note n="1910" id="iii.XLVIII-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p69"><scripRef passage="Mark vi. 23" id="iii.XLVIII-p69.1" parsed="|Mark|6|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.6.23">Mark vi.

contrary mourn for such as sin, rather than curse them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p72">8. This then let us also do, and let us weep for
Herodias, and for them that imitate her. For many such revels now also
take place, and though John be not slain, yet the members of Christ
are, and in a far more grievous way. For it is not a head in a charger
that the dancers of our time ask, but the souls of them that sit at the
feast. For in making them slaves, and leading them to unlawful loves,
and besetting them with harlots, they do not take off the head, but
slay the soul, making them adulterers, and effeminate, and
whoremongers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p73">For thou wilt not surely tell me, that when full of
wine, and drunken, and looking at a woman who is dancing and uttering
base words, thou dost not feel anything towards her, neither art
hurried on to profligacy, overcome by thy lust. Nay, that awful thing
befalls thee, that thou “makest the members of Christ members of
an harlot.”<note n="1912" id="iii.XLVIII-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p74"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vi. 15" id="iii.XLVIII-p74.1" parsed="|1Cor|6|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.6.15">1 Cor. vi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p75">For though the daughter of Herodias be not present, yet
the devil, who then danced in her person, in theirs also holds his
choirs now, and departs with the souls of those guests taken
captive.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p76">But if ye are able to keep clear of drunkenness, yet are
ye partakers of another most grievous sin; such revels being also full
of much rapine. For look not, I pray thee, on the meats that are set
before them, nor on the cakes; but consider whence they are gathered,
and thou wilt see that it is of vexation, and covetousness, and
violence, and rapine.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p77">“Nay, ours are not from such sources,” one
may say. God forbid they should be: for neither do I desire it.
Nevertheless, although they be clear of these, not even so are our
costly feasts freed from blame. Hear, at all events, how even apart
from these things the prophet finds fault with them, thus speaking,

perishing with the cold.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p80">Wherefore, though the banquets be clear from
covetousness, yet even so are they accursed, because, while for thy
part thou doest all in excess, to Him thou givest not even His need;
and that, living in luxury upon things that belong to Him. Why, if thou
wert guardian to a child, and having taken possession of his goods,
were to neglect him in extremities, thou wouldest have ten thousand
accusers, and wouldest suffer the punishment appointed by the laws; and
now having taken possession of the goods of Christ, and thus consuming
them for no purpose, dost thou not think thou wilt have to give
account?</p>

saying something witty, goes away filled; this Man, who hath taught us,
what if we had not learnt we should have been no better than the
dogs,—is He counted unworthy of even the same treatment with such
an one?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p82">Dost thou shudder at being told it? Shudder then at the

the actors with their heads shaven?<note n="1916" id="iii.XLVIII-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p86">Comp. Homily XXXVII. 8. Of such parasites Juvenal
says, (Sat. v. 170.)</p>

<p class="c56" id="iii.XLVIII-p87">Omnia ferre</p>

<p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p91">See Mr. Field’s note.</p></note> For among them too is laughter, and rude blows.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p92">These things then dost thou call pleasure, I pray thee,
which are deserving of many tears, of much mourning and lamentation?
And when it were fit to urge them to a good life, to give timely
advice, dost thou lead them on to perjuries, and disorderly language,
and call the thing a delight? and that which procures hell, dost thou
account a subject of pleasure? Yea, and when they are at a loss for
witty sayings, they pay the whole reckoning with oaths and false
swearing. Are these things then worthy of laughter, and not of
lamentations and tears? Nay, who would say so, that hath
understanding?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p93">And this I say, not forbidding them to be fed, but not
for such a purpose. Nay, let their maintenance have the motive of
kindness, not of cruelty; let it be compassion, not insolence. Because
he is a poor man, feed him; because Christ is fed, feed him; not for
introducing satanical sayings, and disgracing his own life. Look not at
him outwardly laughing, but examine his conscience, and then thou wilt
see him uttering ten thousand imprecations against himself, and
groaning, and wailing. And if he do not show it, this also is due to
thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p94">10. Let the companions of thy meals then be men that are
poor and free, not perjured persons, nor stage-players. And if thou
must needs ask of them a requital for their food, enjoin them, should
they see anything done that is amiss, to rebuke, to admonish, to help
thee in thy care over thine household, in the government of thy
servants. Hast thou children? Let these be joint fathers to them, let
them divide thy charge with thee, let them yield thee such profits as
God loveth. Engage them in a spiritual traffic. And if thou see one
needing protection, bid them succor, command them to minister. By these
do thou track the strangers out, by these clothe the naked, by these
send to the prison, put an end to the distresses of others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p95">Let them give thee, for their food, this requital, which
profits both thee and them, and carries with it no condemnation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p96">Hereby friendship also is more closely riveted. For now,
though they seem to be loved, yet for all that they are ashamed, as
living without object in thy house; but if they accomplish these
purposes, both they will be more pleasantly situated, and thou wilt
have more satisfaction in maintaining them, as not spending thy money
without fruit; and they again will dwell with thee in boldness and due
freedom, and thy house, instead of a theatre, will become to thee a
church, and the devil will be put to flight, and Christ will enter, and
the choir of the angels. For where Christ is, there are the angels too,
and where Christ and the angels are, there is Heaven, there is a light
more cheerful than this of the sun.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p97">And if thou wouldest reap yet another consolation
through their means, command them,

<pb n="294" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_294.html" id="iii.XLVIII-Page_294" />

when thou art at leisure, to take their books
and read the divine law. They will have more pleasure in so ministering
to you, than in the other way. For these things add respect both to
thee and to them, but those bring disgrace upon all together; upon thee
as an insolent person and a drunkard, upon them as wretched and
gluttonous. For if thou feed in order to insult them, it is worse than
if thou hadst put them to death; but if for their good and profit, it
is more useful again than if thou hadst brought them back from their
way to execution. And now indeed thou dost disgrace them more than thy
servants, and thy servants enjoy more liberty of speech, and freedom of
conscience, than they do; but then thou wilt make them equal to the
angels.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p98">Set free therefore both them and thine own self, and
take away the name of parasite, and call them companions of thy
meals;<note n="1917" id="iii.XLVIII-p98.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLVIII-p99"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLVIII-p99.1">συσστου</span>.</p></note>cast away the appellation of flatterers, and bestow on them that of
friends. With this intent indeed did God make our friendships, not for
evil to the beloved and loving, but for their good and profit.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p100">But these friendships are more grievous than any enmity.
For by our enemies, if we will, we are even profited; but by these we
must needs be harmed, no question of it. Keep not then friends to teach
thee harm; keep not friends who are enamored rather of thy table than
of thy friendship. For all such persons, if thou retrench thy good
living, retrench their friendship too; but they that associate with
thee for virtue’s sake, remain continually, enduring every
change.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p101">And besides, the race of the parasites doth often take
revenge upon thee, and bring upon thee an ill fame. Hence at least I
know many respectable persons to have got bad characters, and some have
been evil reported of for sorceries, some for adulteries and corrupting
of youths. For whereas they have no work to do, but spend their own
life unprofitably; their ministry is suspected by the multitude as
being the same with that of corrupt youths.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLVIII-p102">Therefore, delivering ourselves both from evil report,
and above all from the hell that is to come, and doing the things that
are well-pleasing to God, let us put an end to this devilish custom,
that “both eating and drinking we may do all things to the glory

<pb n="295" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_295.html" id="iii.XLIX-Page_295" />

seemed to oppose one another. For while His
equality was indicated by His doing all with authority, of His origin
from the Father they could no otherwise be persuaded, than by His doing
all with great lowliness, and with reference to Him, and invoking Him
on His works. Wherefore we see that He neither did these actions only,
nor those, that both might be confirmed; and now He works miracles with
authority, now with prayer.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p35">Then again, that what He did might not seem an
inconsistency, in the lesser things He looks up to Heaven, but in the
greater doth all with authority; to teach thee in the lesser also, that
not as receiving power from elsewhere, but as honoring Him that begat
Him, so He acts. For example: when He forgave sins, and opened
paradise, and brought in the thief, and most utterly set aside the old
law, and raised innumerable dead, and bridled the sea, and reproved the
un-uttered thoughts of men, and created an eye;—which are
achievements of God only and of none else;—we see Him in no
instance praying: but when He provided for the loaves to multiply
themselves, a far less thing than all these, then He looks up to
Heaven; at once establishing these truths which I have spoken of, and
instructing us not to touch a meal, until we have given thanks to Him
who giveth us this food.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p36">And why doth He not make it of things that are not?
Stopping the mouth of Marcion, and of Manichæans, who alienate His
creation from Him, and teaching by His very works, that even all the
things that are seen are His works and creatures, and signifying that
it is Himself who gives the fruits, who said at the beginning,
“Let the earth put forth the herb of grass,” and “Let
the waters bring forth things moving with living souls.”<note n="1932" id="iii.XLIX-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p37"><scripRef passage="Gen. l. 11, 20" id="iii.XLIX-p37.1" parsed="|Gen|50|11|0|0;|Gen|50|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.50.11 Bible:Gen.50.20">Gen. l. 11,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p38">For this is not at all a less work than the other. For
though those were made of things that are not, yet nevertheless were
they of water; and it was no greater thing to produce fruits out of the
earth, and moving things with life out of the water, than out of five
loaves to make so many; and of fishes again, which was a sign that He
was ruler both of the earth and of the sea.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p39">Thus, since the sick were constantly the subject of His
miracles, He works also a general benefit, that the many might not be
spectators only of what befell others, but themselves also partakers of
the gift.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p40">And that which in the wilderness seemed to the Jews
marvellous, (they said at least, “Can He give bread also? or
prepare a table in the wilderness?”<note n="1933" id="iii.XLIX-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p41"><scripRef passage="Ps. lxxviii. 20" id="iii.XLIX-p41.1" parsed="|Ps|78|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.78.20">Ps.
lxxviii. 20</scripRef>.</p></note>) this He shows forth in His works. With this view also He leads them
into the wilderness, that the miracle might be very far beyond
suspicion, and that no one might think that any village lying near
contributed ought to the meal. For this reason He mentions the hour
also, not the place only.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p42">And another thing too we learn, the self-restraint of
the disciples which they practised in necessary things, and how little
they accounted of food. For being twelve, they had five loaves only and
two fishes; so secondary to them were the things of the body: so did
they cling to the things spiritual only.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p43">And not even that little did they hold fast, but gave up
even it when asked. Whereby we should be taught, that though we have
but little, this too we ought to give up to them that are in need.
Thus, when commanded to bring the five loaves, they say not, “and
whence are we to have food? whence to appease our own hunger?”
but they obey at once.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p44">And besides what I have mentioned, to this end, as I at
least think, He makes it out of the materials which they had, namely,
that He might lead them to faith; for as yet they were rather in a weak
state.<note n="1934" id="iii.XLIX-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p45">In these and other places of this Homily there may
be perhaps a tacit reference to the Holy Eucharist, and to the aptitude

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p46">Wherefore also “He looks up to Heaven.” For
of the other miracles they had many examples, but of this none.<note n="1935" id="iii.XLIX-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p47">In these and other places of this Homily there may

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p48">3. “He took the loaves,” therefore,
“and brake them, and gave them by His disciples,” hereby to
honor them; and not in honor to them only, but also that, when the
miracle had been done they might not disbelieve it, nor forget it when
it had past, their own hands bearing them witness.<note n="1936" id="iii.XLIX-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p49">In these and other places of this Homily there may

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p50">Wherefore also He suffers the multitudes first to have a
sense of hunger, and waits for these to come to Him first and ask Him,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p52">Therefore also, from them He receives the loaves, that
the testimonies of what was doing might be many, and that they might
have memorials of the miracle. For if even after these occurrences they
forgot,<note n="1938" id="iii.XLIX-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p53"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 9" id="iii.XLIX-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|16|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.9">Matt. xvi.

provisions?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p54">And He commands them to sit down on the trampled grass,
instructing the multitudes in self-denial. For His will was not to feed

their bodies only, but also to
instruct their souls. As well by the place therefore, as by His giving
them nothing more than loaves and fishes, and by setting the same
before all, and making it common, and by affording no one more than
another, He was teaching them humility, and temperance, and charity,
and to be of like mind one towards another, and to account all things
common.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p55">“And He brake and gave to the disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude.” The five loaves He brake and gave,
and the five multiplied themselves in the hands of the disciples. And
not even here doth He stay the miracle, but He made them even to
exceed; to exceed, not as whole loaves, but as fragments; to signify
that of those loaves these were remains, and in order that the absent
might learn what had been done.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p56">For this purpose indeed He suffered the multitudes to
hunger, that no one might suppose what took place to be illusion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p57">For this also He caused just twelve baskets to remain
over, that Judas also might bear one. For He was able indeed to have
appeased their hunger, but the disciples would not have known His
power, since in Elijah’s case also this took place.<note n="1939" id="iii.XLIX-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p58"><scripRef passage="1 Kings xvii. 16" id="iii.XLIX-p58.1" parsed="|1Kgs|17|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.17.16">1 Kings

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p59">At all events, so greatly were the Jews amazed at Him
for this, that they wished even to make Him a king,<note n="1940" id="iii.XLIX-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p60"><scripRef passage="John vi. 15" id="iii.XLIX-p60.1" parsed="|John|6|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.6.15">John vi.

instance.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p61">What reasoning now may set forth, how the loaves
multiplied<note n="1941" id="iii.XLIX-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p62"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIX-p62.1">ἐπγαζον</span>.</p></note>themselves; how they flowed together in the wilderness; how they were
enough for so many (for there were “five thousand men beside
women and children;” which was a very great commendation of the
people, that both women and men attended Him); how the remnants had
their being (for this again is not less than the former), and became so
abundant, that the baskets were equal in number to the disciples, and
neither more nor less?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p63">Having then taken the fragments, He gave them not to the
multitudes, but to the disciples, and that, because the multitudes were
in a more imperfect state than the disciples.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p64">And, having wrought the miracle, “straightway He
constrained His disciples to get into a ship, and to go before Him unto
the other side, while He sent the multitudes away.”<note n="1942" id="iii.XLIX-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p65"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 22" id="iii.XLIX-p65.1" parsed="|Matt|14|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.22">Matt. xiv.

should send,” etc.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p66">For even if He had seemed, when in sight, to be
presenting an illusion, and not to have wrought a truth; yet surely not
in His absence also. For this cause then, submitting His proceedings to
an exact test, He commanded those that had got the memorials, and the
proof of the miracles, to depart from Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p67">And besides this, when He is doing great works, He
disposes elsewhere of the multitudes and the disciples, instructing us
in nothing to follow after the glory that comes from the people, nor to
collect a crowd about us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p68">Now by saying, “He constrained them,” He
indicates the very close attendance of the disciples.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p69">And His pretext indeed for dismissing them was the
multitude, but He was Himself minded to go up into the mountain; and He
did this, instructing us neither to be always in intercourse with
multitudes, nor always to fly from the crowd, but each of the two as
may be expedient, and giving each duly his turn.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p70">4. Let us learn therefore ourselves also to wait upon
Jesus; but not for His bounty in things sensible, lest we be upbraided
like the Jews. For “ye seek me,” saith He, “not
because ye saw the miracles,<note n="1943" id="iii.XLIX-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p71">[R.V., “ye saw signs.”]</p></note>but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.”<note n="1944" id="iii.XLIX-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p72"><scripRef passage="John vi. 26" id="iii.XLIX-p72.1" parsed="|John|6|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.6.26">John vi.
26</scripRef>.</p></note> Therefore neither doth He work this miracle continually, but a second
time only; that they might be taught not to be slaves to their belly,
but to cling incessantly to the things of the Spirit.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p73">To these then let us also cling, and let us seek the
heavenly bread, and having received it, let us cast away all worldly
care. For if those men left houses, and cities, and kinsmen, and all,
and abode in the wilderness, and when hunger was pressing, withdrew
not; much more ought we, when approaching such a table, to show forth a
more abundant self-command, and to set our love on the things of the
Spirit, and to seek the things of sense as secondary to these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p74">Since even they were blamed, not because they sought Him
for the bread, but because it was for this only they sought Him, and
for this primarily. For should any one despise the great gifts, but
cling to the small, and to those which the giver would have him
despise, he loses these latter too: as on the other hand, if we love
those, He adds these also. For these are but an appendage to the
others; so vile are they and trifling, compared with those, although
they be great. Let us not therefore spend our diligence on them, but
account both the acquisition and loss of them alike indifferent, even
as Job also neither clung to them when present, nor sought them

absent. For on this account, they are
called <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIX-p74.1">χρματα</span>,<note n="1945" id="iii.XLIX-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p75">That is, “things for use.”</p></note>not that we should bury them in the earth, but that we should use them
aright.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p76">And as of artisans every one hath his peculiar skill,
even so the rich man, as he knows not how to work in brass, nor to
frame ships, nor to weave, nor to build houses, nor any such
thing;—let him learn then to use his wealth aright, and to pity
the poor; so shall he know a better art than all those.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p77">For indeed this is above all those arts. Its workshop is
builded in Heaven. It hath its tools not of iron and brass, but of
goodness and of a right will. Of this art Christ is the Teacher, and
His Father. “For be ye merciful,” saith He, “as your
Father which is in Heaven.”<note n="1946" id="iii.XLIX-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p78"><scripRef passage="Luke vi. 36" id="iii.XLIX-p78.1" parsed="|Luke|6|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.36">Luke vi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p79">And what is indeed marvellous, being so much superior to
the rest, it needs no labor, no time for its perfection; it is enough
to have willed, and the whole is accomplished.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p80">But let us see also the end thereof, what it is. What
then is the end of it? Heaven, the good things in the heavens, that
unspeakable glory, the spiritual bride-chambers, the bright lamps, the
abiding with the Bridegroom; the other things, which no speech, nor
even understanding, is able to set forth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p81">So that herein likewise great is its difference from all
others. For most of the arts profit us for the present life, but this
for the life to come also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p82">5. But if it so far excels the arts that are necessary
to us for the present, as medicine, for instance, and house-building,
and all others like them: much more the rest, which if any one were
nicely to examine, he would not even allow them to be arts. Wherefore I
at least would not call those others, as they are unnecessary, so much
as arts at all. For wherein is delicate cookery and making sauces
profitable to us? Nowhere: yea, they are greatly unprofitable and
hurtful, doing harm both to body and soul, by bringing upon us the
parent of all diseases and sufferings, luxury, together with great
extravagance.<note n="1947" id="iii.XLIX-p82.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p83"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIX-p83.1">φιλοτιμα</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p84">But not these only, but not even painting, or
embroidery, would I for one allow to be an art, for they do but throw
men into useless expense. But the arts ought to be concerned with
things necessary and important to our life, to supply and work them up.
For to this end God gave us skill at all, that we might invent methods,
whereby to furnish out our life. But that there should be figures<note n="1948" id="iii.XLIX-p84.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p85"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIX-p85.1">ζωδων</span>. See Herod. i. 70, and
Schweighæuser’s note, as quoted here by Mr. Field.</p></note>either on walls, or on garments, wherein is it useful, I pray thee? For
this same cause the sandal-makers too, and the weavers, should have
great retrenchments made in their art. For most things in it they have
carried into vulgar ostentation,<note n="1949" id="iii.XLIX-p85.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p86"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIX-p86.1">τ
βναυσον</span>.</p></note>having corrupted its necessary use, and mixed with an honest art an
evil craft; which has been the case with the art of building also. But
even as to this, so long as it builds houses and not theatres, and
labors upon things necessary, and not superfluous, I give the name of
an art; so the business of weaving too, as long as it makes clothes,
and coverlids, but does not imitate the spiders, and overwhelm men with
much absurdity, and unspeakable effeminacy, so long I call it an
art.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p87">And the sandal-makers’ trade, so long as it makes
sandals, I will not rob of the appellation of art; but when it perverts
men to the gestures of women, and causes them by their sandals to grow
wanton and delicate, we will set it amidst the things hurtful and
superfluous, and not so much as name it an art.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p88">And I know well, that to many I seem over-minute in
busying myself about these things; I shall not however refrain for
this. For the cause of all our evils is this, such faults being at all
counted trifling, and therefore disregarded.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p89">And what sin, say you, can be of less account than this,
of having an ornamented and glittering sandal, which fits the foot; if
indeed it seem right at all to denominate it a sin?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p90">Will ye then that I let loose my tongue upon it, and
show its unseemliness, how great it is? and will ye not be angry? Or
rather, though ye be angry, I care not much. Nay, for yourselves are to
blame for this folly, who do not so much as think it is a sin, and
hereby constrain us to enter upon the reproof of this extravagance.
Come then, let us examine it, and let us see what sort of an evil it
is. For when the silken threads, which it is not seemly should be even
inwoven in your garments, these are sewn by you into your shoes, what
reproach, what derision do these things deserve?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p91">And if thou despise our judgments, hear the voice of
Paul, with great earnestness forbidding these things, and then thou
wilt perceive the absurdity of them. What then saith he? “Not
with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.”<note n="1950" id="iii.XLIX-p91.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p92"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 9" id="iii.XLIX-p92.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.9">1 Tim. ii.

prohibiting the married woman to have costly clothing, thou extendest
this effeminacy even to thy shoes, and hast no end of contri

<pb n="298" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_298.html" id="iii.XLIX-Page_298" />

vances for the sake of this ridicule and
reproach? Yes: for first a ship is built, then rowers are mustered, and
a man for the prow, and a helmsman, and a sail is spread, and an ocean
traversed, and, leaving wife and children and country, the merchant
commits his very life to the waves, and comes to the land of the
barbarians, and undergoes innumerable dangers for these threads, that
after it all thou mayest take them, and sew them into thy shoes, and
ornament the leather. And what can be done worse than this folly?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p93">But the old ways are not like these, but such as become
men. Wherefore I for my part expect that in process of time the young
men amongst us will wear even women’s shoes, and not be ashamed.
And what is more grievous, men’s fathers seeing these things are
not much displeased, but do even account it an indifferent matter.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p94">Would ye that I should add what is still more grievous;
that these things are done even when there are many poor? Would ye that
I bring before you Christ, an hungered, naked, wandering everywhere, in
chains? And how many thunderbolts must ye not deserve, overlooking Him
in want of necessary food, and adorning these pieces of leather with so
much diligence? And He indeed, when He was giving law to His disciples,
would not so much as suffer them to have shoes at all, but we cannot
bear to walk, I say not barefooted, but even with feet shod as they
ought to be.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p95">7. What then can be worse than this unseemliness, this
absurdity? For the thing marks a soul, in the first place effeminate,
then unfeeling and cruel, then curious and idly busy. For when will he
be able to attend to any necessary matter, who is taken up with these
superfluous things? when will such a youth endure to take heed to his
soul, or to consider so much as that he hath a soul? Yes, he surely
will be a trifler who cannot help admiring such things; he cruel, who
for their sake neglects the poor; he void of virtue, who spends all his
diligence on them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p96">For he that is curious about the beauty of threads, and
the bloom of colors, and the tendrils made of such woven work, when
will he be able to look upon the heaven? when will he admire the beauty
there, who is excited about a kind of beauty that belongs to pieces of
leather, and who is bending to the earth? And whereas God hath
stretched out the Heaven, and lighted up the sun, drawing thy looks
upwards; thou constrainest thyself to look downwards, and to the earth,
like the swine, and obeyest the devil. For indeed this wicked demon
hath devised this unseemliness, to draw thee off from that beauty. For
this intent hath he drawn thee this way; and God, showing Heaven, is
outvied by a devil showing certain skins, or rather not even skins (for
indeed these too are God’s works), but effeminacy and a bad kind
of skill.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p97">And the young man goes about bending down towards the
earth, he that is required to seek wisdom concerning the things in
Heaven; priding himself more on these trifles than if he had
accomplished some great and good work, and walking on tiptoe in the
forum, and hereby begetting to himself superfluous sorrows and
distresses, lest he should stain them with the mud when it is winter;
lest he should cover them with the dust, when summer is come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p98">What sayest thou, O man? Hast thou cast thy whole soul
into the mire through this extravagance, and dost thou overlook it
trailing on the ground, and art thou so anxious about a pair of shoes?
Mark their use, and respect the verdict thou passest on them. For to
tread on mud and mire, and all the spots on the pavement, for this were
thy shoes made. Or if thou canst not bear this, take and hang them from
thy neck, or put them on thy head.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p99">And ye indeed laugh at hearing this. But I am inclined
to weep for these men’s madness, and their earnest care about
these matters. For in truth they would rather stain their body with
mud, than those pieces of leather.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p100">Triflers then they become in this way, and fond of money
again in another way. For he that has been used to be frantic and eager
upon such matters, requires also for his clothes and for all other
things much expense, and a large income.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p101">And if he have a munificent father, his thraldom becomes
worse, his absurd fancy more intense; but if a parsimonious one, he is
driven to other unseemliness, by way of getting together a little money
for such expenses.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p102">Hence many young men have even sold their manhood, and
have become parasites to the rich, and have undertaken other servile
offices, purchasing thereby the fulfillment of such desires.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p103">So then, that this man is sure to be at once fond of
money, and a trifler, and about important things the most indolent of
all men, and that he will be forced to commit many sins, is hereby
evident. And that he is cruel and vainglorious, neither this will any
one gainsay: cruel, in that when he sees a poor man, through the love
of finery he makes as though he did not even see him, but while he

<pb n="299" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_299.html" id="iii.XLIX-Page_299" />

is decking out these things with
gold, overlooks him perishing of hunger; vainglorious, since even in
such little matters he trains himself to hunt after the admiration of
the beholders. For I suppose no general prides himself so much on his
legions and trophies, as our profligate youths on the decking out of
their shoes, on their trailing garments, on the dressing of their hair;
yet surely all these are works of other persons, in their trades. But
if men do not cease from vain boasting in the works of others, when
will they cease from it in their own?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p104">8. Shall I mention yet other things more grievous than
these? or are even these enough for you? Well then; I must end my
speech here; since even this have I said, because of the disputatious,
who maintain the thing not to be so very wrong.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p105">And although I know that many of the young will not so
much as attend to what I have said, being once for all intoxicated with
this fancy, I yet ought not therefore to keep silence. For such fathers
as have understanding, and are as yet sound, will be able to force
them, even against their will, to a becoming decency.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p106">Say not then, “this is of no consequence, that is
of no consequence;” for this, this hath ruined all. For even
hereby ought you to train them, and by the things which seem trifling
to make them grave, great of soul, superior to outward habiliments; so
shall we find them approved in the great things also. For what is more
ordinary than the learning of letters? nevertheless thereby do men
become rhetoricians,<note n="1951" id="iii.XLIX-p106.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.XLIX-p107">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.XLIX-p107.1">ῥήτορε</span>.]</p></note>and sophists, and philosophers, and if they know not their letters,
neither will they ever have that knowledge.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p108">And this we have spoken not to young men only, but to
women also, and to young damsels. For these too are liable to the like
charges, and much more, inasmuch as seemliness is a thing appropriate
to a virgin.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p109">What has been said therefore to the others; do ye
account to have been said to you also, that we may not repeat again the
same things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p110">For it is full time now to close our discourse with
prayer. All of you then pray with us, that the young men of the church
above all things may be enabled to live orderly, and to attain an old
age becoming them. Since for those surely who do not so live, it were
well not to come to old age at all. But for them that have grown old
even in youth, I pray that they may attain also to the very deep of
gray hairs, and become fathers of approved children, and may be a joy
to them that gave them birth, and above all surely to the God that made
them, and may exterminate every distempered fancy, not that about their
shoes, nor about their clothes only, but every other kind also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p111">For as untilled land, such is also youth neglected,
bringing forth many thorns from many quarters. Let us then send forth
on them the fire of the Spirit, and burn up these wicked desires, and
let us break up our fields, and make them ready for the reception of
the seed, and the young men amongst us let us exhibit with soberer
minds than the old elsewhere. For this in fact is the marvellous thing,
when temperance shines forth in youth; since he surely that is
temperate in old age cannot have a great reward, having in perfection
the security from his age. But what is wonderful, is to enjoy a calm
amidst waves, and in a furnace not to be burnt, and in youth not to run
wanton.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.XLIX-p112">With these things then in our minds, let us emulate that
blessed Joseph, who shone through all these trials, that we may attain
unto the same crowns with him; unto which may we all attain, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory
unto the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, now and always, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

tossed with waves:</i><note n="1952" id="iii.L-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p4">[R.V., “distressed by the waves.”]</p></note><i>for the wind was contrary.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.L-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.L-p5.1">For</span> what purpose doth He go up
into the mountain? To teach us, that loneliness and retirement is good,
when we are to pray to God. With this view, you see, He is continually
withdrawing into the wilderness, and there often spends the whole night
in prayer, teaching us earnestly to seek such quietness in our prayers,
as the time and place may confer. For the wilderness is the mother of
quiet; it is a calm and a harbor, delivering us from all turmoils.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p6">He Himself then went up thither with this object, but
the disciples are tossed with the waves again, and undergo a storm,
equal even to the former. But whereas before they had Him in the ship
when this befell them, now they were alone by themselves. Thus gently
and by degrees He excites and urges them on for the better, even to the
bearing all nobly. Accordingly we see, that when they were first near
that danger, He was present, though asleep, so as readily to give them
relief; but now leading them to a greater degree of endurance, He doth
not even this, but departs, and in mid sea permits the storm to arise,
so that they might not so much as look for a hope of preservation from
any quarter; and He lets them be tempest-tost all the night, thoroughly
to awaken, as I suppose, their hardened heart.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p7">For such is the nature of the fear, which the time
concurs with the rough weather in producing. And together with the
compunction, He cast them also into a greater longing for Himself, and
a continual remembrance of Him.</p>

once. For, “in the fourth watch,” so it is said, “of

that it is an apparition.” The Greek term is <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.L-p11.2">φντασμα</span>, not <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.L-p11.3">πνεμα</span>.—R.]</p></note>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p12">Yea, and He constantly doth so; when He is on the point
of removing our terrors, He brings upon us other worse things, and more
alarming: which we see took place then also. For together with the
storm, the sight too troubled them, no less than the storm. Therefore
neither did He remove the darkness, nor straightway make Himself
manifest, training them, as I said, by the continuance of these fears,
and instructing them to be ready to endure. This He did in the case of
Job also; for when He was on the point of removing the terror and the
temptation, then He suffered the end to grow more grievous; I mean not
for his children’s death, or the words of his wife, but because
of the reproaches, both of his servants and of his friends. And when He
was about to rescue Jacob from his affliction in the strange land, He
allowed his trouble to be awakened and aggravated: in that his
father-in-law first overtook him and threatened death, and then his
brother coming immediately after, suspended over him the extremest
danger.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p13">For since one cannot be tempted both for a long time and
severely; when the righteous are on the point of coming to an end of
their conflicts, He, willing them to gain the more, enhances their
struggles. Which He did in the case of Abraham too, appointing for his
last conflict that about his child. For thus even things intolerable
will be tolerable, when they are so brought upon us, as to have their
removal near, at the very doors.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p14">So did Christ at that time also, and did not discover
Himself before they cried out. For the more intense their alarm, the
more did they welcome His coming. Afterward when they had exclaimed, it
is said,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p18">2. What then saith Peter, everywhere ardent, and ever
starting forward before the rest?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p19">“Lord, if it be Thou,” saith he, “bid
me come unto Thee on the water.”<note n="1956" id="iii.L-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 28" id="iii.L-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|14|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.28">Matt. xiv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p21">He said not, “Pray and entreat,” but,
“bid.” Seest thou how great his ardor, how great his faith?
Yet surely he is hereby often in danger, by seeking things beyond his
measure. For so here too he required an exceedingly great thing, for
love only, not for display. For neither did he say, “Bid me walk
on the water,” but what? “Bid me come unto Thee.” For
none so loved Jesus.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p22">This he did also after the resurrection; he endured not
to come with the others, but leapt forward.<note n="1957" id="iii.L-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p23"><scripRef passage="John xxi. 7" id="iii.L-p23.1" parsed="|John|21|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.21.7">John xxi.

And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand and caught him, and
saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou
doubt?”<note n="1960" id="iii.L-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 29-31" id="iii.L-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|14|29|14|31" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.29-Matt.14.31">Matt. xiv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p28">This is more wonderful than the former. Therefore this
is done after that. For when He had shown that He rules the sea, then
He carries on the sign to what is yet more marvellous. Then He rebuked
the winds only; but now He both walks Himself, and permits another to
do so; which thing if He had required to be done at the beginning,
Peter would not have so well received it, because he had not yet
acquired so great faith.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p29">Wherefore then did Christ permit him? Why, if He had
said, “thou canst not,” Peter being ardent would have
contradicted Him again. Wherefore by the facts He convinces him, that
for the future he may be sobered.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p30">But not even so doth he endure. Therefore having come
down, he becomes dizzy; for he was afraid. And this the surf caused,
but his fear was wrought by the wind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p31">But John saith, that “they willingly received Him
into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land whither they
went,”<note n="1961" id="iii.L-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p32"><scripRef passage="John vi. 21" id="iii.L-p32.1" parsed="|John|6|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.6.21">John vi.

willing to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at
the land whither they were going.”]</p></note>relating this same circumstance. So that when they were on the point of
arriving at the land, He entered the ship.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p33">Peter then having come down from the ship went unto Him,
not rejoicing so much in walking on the water, as in coming unto Him.
And when he had prevailed over the greater, he was on the point of
suffering evil from the less, from the violence of the wind, I mean,
not of the sea. For such a thing is human nature; not seldom effecting
great things, it exposes itself in the less; as Elias felt toward
Jezebel, as Moses toward the Egyptian, as David toward Bathsheba. Even
so then this man also; while their fear was yet at the height, he took
courage to walk upon the water, but against the assault of the wind he
was no longer able to stand; and this, being near Christ. So absolutely
nothing doth it avail to be near Christ, not being near Him by
faith.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p34">And this also showed the difference between the Master
and the disciple, and allayed the feelings of the others. For if in the
case of the two brethren they had indignation, much more here; for they
had not yet the Spirit vouchsafed unto them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p35">But afterwards they were not like this. On every
occasion, for example, they give up the first honors to Peter, and put
him forward in their addresses to the people, although of a rougher
vein than any of them.<note n="1962" id="iii.L-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p36">Compare <scripRef passage="Acts iv. 13" id="iii.L-p36.1" parsed="|Acts|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.13">Acts iv. 13</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p37">And wherefore did He not command the winds to cease, but
Himself stretched forth His hand and took hold of him? Because in him
faith was required. For when our part is wanting, then God’s part
also is at a stand.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p38">Signifying therefore that not the assault of the wind,
but his want of faith had wrought his overthrow, He saith,
“Wherefore didst thou doubt, O thou of little faith?” So
that if his faith had not been weak, he would have stood easily against
the wind also. And for this reason, you see, even when He had caught
hold of Him, He suffers the wind to blow, showing that no hurt comes
thereby, when faith is steadfast.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p39">And as when a nestling has come out of the nest before
the time, and is on the point of falling, its mother bears it on her
wings, and brings it back to the nest; even so did Christ.</p>

For both by His walking on the sea, and by His commanding another to do
so, and preserving him in jeopardy; their faith was henceforth great.
For then indeed He rebuked the sea, but now He rebukes it not, in
another way signifying His power more abundantly. Wherefore also they
said, “Of a truth Thou art Son of God.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p45">What then? Did He rebuke them on their so speaking? Nay,
quite the contrary, He rather confirmed what they said, with greater
authority healing such as approached Him, and not as before.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p46">“And when they were gone over,” so it is
said, “they came into the land of Gennesaret. And when the men of
that place had knowledge of Him, they sent out into all that country

Him that they might touch the hem of His garment; and as many as
touched were made perfectly whole.”<note n="1966" id="iii.L-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p47"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 34-36" id="iii.L-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|14|34|14|36" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.34-Matt.14.36">Matt. xiv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p48">For neither did they approach Him as before, dragging
Him into their houses, and seeking a touch of His hand, and directions
from Him in words; but in a far higher strain, and with more of
self-denial, and with a more abundant faith did they try to win
themselves a cure; for she that had the issue of blood taught them all
to be severe in seeking wisdom.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p49">And the evangelist, implying also that at long intervals
He visited the several neighborhoods, saith, “The men of that
place took knowledge of Him, and sent out into the country round about,
and brought unto Him them that were diseased.” But yet the
interval, so far from abolishing their faith, made it even greater, and
preserved it in vigor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p50">3. Let us also then touch the hem of His garment, or
rather, if we be willing, we have Him entire. For indeed His body is
set before us now, not His garment only, but even His body; not for us
to touch it only, but also to eat, and be filled. Let us now then draw
near with faith, every one that hath an infirmity. For if they that
touched the hem of His garment drew from Him so much virtue, how much
more they that possess Him entire? Now to draw near with faith is not
only to receive the offering, but also with a pure heart to touch it;
to be so minded, as approaching Christ Himself. For what, if thou hear
no voice? Yet thou seest Him laid out; or rather thou dost also hear
His voice, while He is speaking by the evangelists.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p51">Believe, therefore, that even now it is that supper, at
which He Himself sat down. For this is in no respect different from
that. For neither doth man make this and Himself the other; but both
this and that is His own work. When therefore thou seest the priest
delivering it unto thee, account not that it is the priest that doeth
so, but that it is Christ’s hand that is stretched out.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p52">Even as when he baptizes, not he doth baptize thee, but
it is God that possesses thy head with invisible power, and neither
angel nor archangel nor any other dare draw nigh and touch thee; even
so now also. For when God begets, the gift is His only. Seest thou not
those who adopt to themselves sons here, how they commit not the act to
slaves, but are themselves present at the judgment-seat? Even so
neither hath God committed His gift to angels, but Himself is present,
commanding and saying, “Call no man Father on earth;”<note n="1967" id="iii.L-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p53"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 9" id="iii.L-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|23|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.9">Matt.

thou shouldest prefer to all those Him that made thee, and enrolled
thee amongst His own children. For He that hath given the greater, that
is, hath set Himself before thee, much more will He not think scorn to
distribute unto thee of His body. Let us hear therefore, both priests
and subjects, what we have had vouchsafed to us; let us hear and
tremble. Of His own holy flesh He hath granted us our fill; He hath set
before us Himself sacrificed.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p54">What excuse shall we have then, when feeding on such
food, we commit such sins? when eating a lamb, we become wolves? when
feeding on a sheep, we spoil by violence like the lions?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p55">For this mystery He directs to be always clear, not from
violence only, but even from bare enmity. Yea, for this mystery is a
mystery of peace; it allows us not to cling to wealth. For if He spared
not Himself for us, what must we deserve, sparing our wealth, and being
lavish of a soul, in behalf of which He spared not Himself?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p56">Now upon the Jews God every year bound

favors to them: but for thee, every day, as I may say, through these
mysteries.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p57">Be not therefore ashamed of the cross: for these are our
venerable things, these our mysteries; with this gift do we adorn
ourselves, with this we are beautified.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p58">And if I say, He stretched out the heaven, He spread out
the earth and the sea, He sent prophets and angels, I say nothing in
comparison. For the sum of His benefits is this, that “He spared
not His own Son,”<note n="1968" id="iii.L-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p59"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 32" id="iii.L-p59.1" parsed="|Rom|8|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.32">Rom. viii.

for both these perished through covetousness. Let us flee then from
this gulf; neither let us account it enough for our salvation, if after
we have stripped widows and orphans, we offer for this table a gold and
jewelled cup. Nay, if thou desire to honor the sacrifice, offer thy
soul, for which also it was slain; cause that to become golden; but if
that remain worse than lead or potter’s clay, while the vessel is
of gold, what is the profit?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p61">Let not this therefore be our aim, to offer golden
vessels only, but to do so from honest earnings likewise. For these are
of the sort that is more precious even than gold, these that are
without injuriousness. For the church is not a gold foundry nor a
workshop for silver, but an assembly of angels. Wherefore it is souls
which we require, since in fact God accepts these for the souls’
sake.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p62">That table at that time was not of silver nor that cup

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p64">Wouldest thou do honor to Christ’s body? Neglect
Him not when naked; do not while here thou honorest Him with silken
garments, neglect Him perishing without of cold and nakedness. For He
that said, “This is my body,” and by His word confirmed the
fact, “This same said, “Ye saw me an hungered, and fed me
not;” and, “Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least

much attention.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p66">Let us learn therefore to be strict in life, and to
honor Christ as He Himself desires. For to Him who is honored that
honor is most pleasing, which it is His own will to have, not that
which we account best. Since Peter too thought to honor Him by
forbidding Him to wash his feet, but his doing so was not an honor, but
the contrary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p67">Even so do thou honor Him with this honor, which He
ordained, spending thy wealth on poor people. Since God hath no need at
all of golden vessels, but of golden souls.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p68">And these things I say, not forbidding such offerings to
be provided; but requiring you, together with them, and before them, to
give alms. For He accepts indeed the former, but much more the latter.
For in the one the offerer alone is profited, but in the other the
receiver also. Here the act seems to be a ground even of ostentation;
but there all is mercifulness, and love to man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p69">For what is the profit, when His table indeed is full of
golden cups, but He perishes with hunger? First fill Him, being an
hungered, and then abundantly deck out His table also. Dost thou make
Him a cup of gold, while thou givest Him not a cup of cold water? And
what is the profit? Dost thou furnish His table with cloths bespangled
with gold, while to Himself thou affordest not even the necessary
covering? And what good comes of it? For tell me, should you see one at
a loss for necessary food, and omit appeasing his hunger, while you
first overlaid his table with silver; would he indeed thank thee, and
not rather be indignant? What, again, if seeing one wrapped in rags,
and stiff with cold, thou shouldest neglect giving him a garment, and
build golden columns, saying, “thou wert doing it to his
honor,” would he not say that thou wert mocking, and account it
an insult, and that the most extreme?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p70">Let this then be thy thought with regard to Christ also,
when He is going about a wanderer, and a stranger, needing a roof to
cover Him; and thou, neglecting to receive Him, deckest out a pavement,
and walls, and capitals of columns, and hangest up silver chains by
means of lamps,<note n="1971" id="iii.L-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.L-p71">St. Jerome (ad Eustoch. <scripRef passage="Ep. 108" id="iii.L-p71.1">Ep. 108</scripRef> sec. 30) says,
“Let others boast of their money, and coin cast into the treasury
of God, <i>Funalibusque aureis dona pendentia</i>, ‘and of their
gifts hanging upon golden sconces,’ or perhaps brackets for
lamps, on which the Anathemata, or votive offerings, were
suspended.” See Bingh. 8, 8, 1.</p></note>but Himself bound in prison thou wilt not even look upon.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.L-p72">5. And these things I say, not forbidding munificence in
these matters, but admonishing you to do those other works together
with these, or rather even before these. Because for not having done
these no one was ever blamed, but for those, hell is threatened, and
unquenchable fire, and the punishment with evil spirits. Do not
therefore while adorning His house overlook thy brother in distress,

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p10">But not the less were they innovating; as in this
instance, that one ought not to eat with unwashen hands, that we must
wash cups and brazen vessels, that we must wash also ourselves. Thus,
when men were henceforth, as time advanced, to be freed from their
observances, at that very time they bound them with the same in more
and more instances, fearing lest any one should take away their power,
and wishing to strike more dread, as though they were themselves also
lawgivers. The thing in fact proceeded so far in enormity, that while
their own commandments were kept, those of God were transgressed; and
they so far prevailed, that the matter had actually become a ground of
accusation. Which was a twofold charge against them, in that they both
invented novelties, and were so strict exactors on their own account,
while of God they made no reckoning.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p11">And omitting to speak of the other things, the pots and
the brazen vessels (for it was too ridiculous), what seemed more
reasonable than the rest, that they bring forward, wishing, as seems at
least to me, in that way to provoke Him to anger. Wherefore also they
made mention of the elders, in order that He, as setting them at
nought, might give occasion against Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p12">But it were meet first to inquire, why the disciples ate
with unwashen hands. Wherefore then did they so eat? Not as making a
point of it, but as overlooking henceforth the things that are
superfluous, and attending to such as are necessary; having no law to
wash or not to wash, but doing either as it happened. For they that
despised even their own necessary food, how were they to hold these
things worth much consideration? This then having often happened
unintentionally,—for instance, when they ate in the wilderness,
when they plucked the ears of corn,—is now put forward as a
charge by these persons, who are always transgressing in the great
things, and making much account of the superfluous.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p13">2. What then saith Christ? He did not set Himself
against it, neither made He any defense, but straightway blames them
again, plucking down their confidence, and signifying that he who
commits great sins ought not to be strict with others concerning small
matters. “What? when you ought to be blamed,” saith He,
“do ye even blame?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p14">But do thou observe, how when it is His will to set
aside any of the things enjoined by the law, He does it in the form of
an apology; and so He did in that case. For by no means doth He proceed
at once to transgress it, nor doth He say, “It is nothing;”
for surely He would have made them more audacious; but first He clean
cuts away their boldness, bringing forward the far heavier charge, and
directing it upon their head. And He neither saith, “they do well
in transgressing it,” lest He should give them a hold on Him; nor
doth He speak ill of their proceeding, lest He should confirm the law:
nor again, on the other hand, doth He blame the elders, as lawless and
unholy men; for doubtless they would have shunned Him as a reviler and
injurious: but all these things He gives up, and proceeds another way.
And He seems indeed to be rebuking the persons themselves who had come
to Him, but He is reprehending them that enacted these laws; nowhere
indeed making mention of the elders, but by His charge against the
Scribes casting down them also, and signifying that their sin is
twofold, first in disobeying God, next in doing so on men’s
account; as though He had said, “Why this, this hath ruined you,
your obeying the elders in all things.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p15">Yet He saith not so, but this is just what He intimates,
by answering them as follows:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p16">“Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God
by<note n="1981" id="iii.LI-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p17">[R.V., “because of.”]</p></note>your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and thy
mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a
gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, and<note n="1982" id="iii.LI-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p18">[Chrysostom read <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LI-p18.1">κα</span>, with the rec. text, thus making the sentence
break off. The A.V. supplies “he shall be free.” R.V.,
omitting “and,” with the best authorities, makes this
clause the conclusion: “he shall not honor,”
etc.—R.]</p></note>honor not his father or his mother<note n="1983" id="iii.LI-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p19">[R.V. text omits “and his mother.”]</p></note>—And ye have made void the commandment<note n="1984" id="iii.LI-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p20">[So rec. text, but R.V. reads “word” in

3–6</scripRef>. [R.V.,
“because of your tradition.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p22">And He said not, “the elders’
tradition,” but “your own.” And, “ye
say;” again He said not, “the elders say:” in order
to make His speech less galling. That is, because they wanted to prove
the disciples transgressors of the law, He signifies that they
themselves are doing so, but that these are free from blame. For of
course that is not a law, which is enjoined by men (wherefore also He
calls it “a tradition”), and especially by men that are
transgressors of the law.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p23">And since this had no shade of contrariety to the law,
to command men to wash their hands, He brings forward another
tradition, which is opposed to the law. And what He

<pb n="306" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_306.html" id="iii.LI-Page_306" />

saith is like this. “They taught the
young, under the garb of piety, to despise their fathers.” How,
and in what way? “If one of their parents said to his child, Give
me this sheep that thou hast, or this calf, or any such thing, they
used to say, ‘This is a gift to God, whereby thou wouldest be
profited by me, and thou canst not have it.’ And two evils hence
arose: on the one hand they did not bring them to God, on the other
they defrauded their parents under the name of the offering, alike
insulting their parents for God’s sake, and God for their
parents’ sake.” But He doth not say this at once, but first
rehearses the law, by which He signifies His earnest desire that
parents should be honored. For, “honor,” saith He,
“thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest live long upon the
earth.”<note n="1986" id="iii.LI-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p24"><scripRef passage="Exod. 20.12; Ephes. 6.1,2" id="iii.LI-p24.1" parsed="|Exod|20|12|0|0;|Eph|6|1|6|2" osisRef="Bible:Exod.20.12 Bible:Eph.6.1-Eph.6.2">Exod. xx. 12.

death.”<note n="1987" id="iii.LI-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p25"><scripRef passage="Exod. xxi. 17" id="iii.LI-p25.1" parsed="|Exod|21|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.21.17">Exod. xxi.
17</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p26">But He, omitting the first, the reward appointed for
them that honor their parents, states that which is more awful, the
punishment, I mean, threatened to such as dishonor them; desiring both
to dismay them, and to conciliate such as have understanding; and He
implies them to be for this worthy of death. For if he who dishonors
them in word is punished, much more ye, who do so in deed, and who not
only dishonor, but also teach it to others. “Ye then who ought
not so much as to live, how find ye fault with the
disciples?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p27">“And what wonder is it, if ye offer such insults
to me, who am as yet unknown, when even to the Father ye are found
doing the like?” For everywhere He both asserts and implies, that
from Him they began with this their arrogance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p28">But some do also otherwise interpret, “It is a
gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;” that is, I
owe thee no honor, but it is a free gift from me to thee, if indeed I
do honor thee. But Christ would not have mentioned an insult of that
sort.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p29">And Mark again makes this plainer, by saying, “It
is Corban, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;”<note n="1988" id="iii.LI-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p30"><scripRef passage="Mark vii. 11" id="iii.LI-p30.1" parsed="|Mark|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.7.11">Mark vii.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>which means, not a gift and present, but properly an offering.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p31">Having then signified that they who were trampling on
the law could not be justly entitled to blame men for transgressing a
command of certain elders, He points out this same thing again from the
prophet likewise. Thus, having once laid hold of them severely, He
proceeds further: as on every occasion He doth, bringing forward the
Scriptures, and so evincing Himself to be in accordance with God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p32">And what saith the prophet? “This people honoreth
me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they
worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”<note n="1989" id="iii.LI-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. 15.8,9; Isa. 29.13" id="iii.LI-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|15|8|15|9;|Isa|29|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.8-Matt.15.9 Bible:Isa.29.13">Matt. xv. 8, 9. See Is. xxix. 13</scripRef>. [R.V., “teaching <i>as
their</i> doctrines the precepts of men.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p34">Seest thou a prophecy in exact accordance with His
sayings, and from the very first proclaiming beforehand their
wickedness? For what Christ laid to their charge now, of this Isaiah
also spake from the very first; that the words of God they despise,
“for in vain do they worship me,” saith He; but of their
own they make much account, “teaching,” saith He,
“for doctrines the commandments of men.” Therefore with
reason the disciples keep them not.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p35">3. Having, you see, given them their mortal blow; and
from the facts first, then from their own suffrage, then from the
prophet having aggravated the charge, with them indeed He discourses
not at all, incorrigibly disposed as they are now come to be, but
directs His speech to the multitudes, so as to introduce His doctrine,
great and high, and full of much strictness; and taking occasion from
the former topic, He proceeds to insert that which is greater, casting
out also the observance of meats.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p36">But see when. When He had cleansed the leper, when He
had repealed the Sabbath, when He had shown Himself King of earth and
sea, when He had made laws, when He had remitted sins, when He had
raised dead men, when He had afforded them many proofs of His Godhead,
then He discourses of meats.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p37">For indeed all the religion of the Jews is comprised in
this; if thou take this away, thou hast even taken away all. For hereby
He signifies, that circumcision too must be abrogated. But of Himself
He doth not prominently introduce this (forasmuch as that was older
than the other commandments, and had higher estimation), but He enacts
it by His disciples. For so great a thing was it, that even the
disciples after so long a time being minded to do it away, first
practise it, and so put it down.<note n="1990" id="iii.LI-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p38"><scripRef passage="Acts xvi. 3" id="iii.LI-p38.1" parsed="|Acts|16|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.3">Acts xvi.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p39">But see how He introduces His law: how “He called
the multitude, and said unto them, Hear and understand.”<note n="1991" id="iii.LI-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 11" id="iii.LI-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.11">Matt. xv.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p41">Thus He doth by no means simply reveal it to them, but
by respect and courtesy, first, He makes His saying acceptable (for
this the evangelist declares by saying, “He called

<pb n="307" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_307.html" id="iii.LI-Page_307" />

them unto Him”): and secondly, by the
time also; in that after their refutation, and His victory over them,
and the accusation by the prophet, then He begins His legislation, when
they too would more easily receive His sayings.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p42">And He doth not merely call them unto Him, but also
makes them more attentive. For “understand,” saith He, that
is, “consider, rouse yourselves; for of that sort is the law now
about to be enacted. For if they set aside the law, even unseasonably,
for their own tradition, and ye hearkened; much more ought ye to
hearken unto me, who at the proper season am leading you unto a higher
rule of self restraint.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p43">And He did not say, “The observance of meats is
nothing, neither that Moses had given wrong injunctions, nor that of
condescension He did so;” but in the way of admonition and
counsel, and taking His testimony from the nature of the things, He
saith: “Not the things that go into the mouth, defile the man,
but the things that go out of the mouth;”<note n="1992" id="iii.LI-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p44"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 11" id="iii.LI-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.11">Matt. xv.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>resorting to nature herself both in His enactment and in His
demonstration. Yet they hearing all this, made no reply, neither did
they say, “What sayest Thou? When God hath given charges without
number concerning the observance of meats, dost thou make such
laws?” But since He had utterly stopped their mouths, not by
refuting them only, but also by publishing their craft, and exposing
what was done by them in secret, and revealing the secrets of their
mind; their mouths were stopped, and so they went away.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p45">But mark, I pray thee, how He doth not yet venture
distinctly to set Himself with boldness against the meats. Therefore
neither did He say “the meats,” but, “the things that
enter in defile not the man;” which it was natural for them to
suspect concerning the unwashen hands also. For He indeed was speaking
of meats, but it would be understood of these matters too.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p46">Why, so strong was the feeling of scruple about the
meats, that even after the resurrection Peter said, “Not so,
Lord, for I have never eaten anything common or unclean.”<note n="1993" id="iii.LI-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p47"><scripRef passage="Acts x. 14" id="iii.LI-p47.1" parsed="|Acts|10|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.10.14">Acts x.
14</scripRef>.</p></note> For although it was for the sake of others that He said this, and in
order to leave Himself a justification against his censurers, by
pointing out that he actually remonstrated, and not even so was
excused, nevertheless it implies the depth of their impression on that
point.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p48">Wherefore you see He Himself also at the beginning spake
not openly concerning meats, but, “The things that go into the
mouth;” and again, when He had seemed afterwards to speak more
plainly, He veiled it by His conclusion, saying, “But to eat with
unwashen hands defileth not the man:”<note n="1994" id="iii.LI-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p49"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 20" id="iii.LI-p49.1" parsed="|Matt|15|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.20">Matt. xv.
20</scripRef>.</p></note>that He might seem to have had His occasion from thence, and to be
still discoursing of the same. Therefore He said not, “To eat
meats defileth not a man,” but is as though He were speaking on
that other topic; that they may have nothing to say against it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p50">4. When therefore they had heard these things,
“the Pharisees,” it is said, “were
offended,”<note n="1995" id="iii.LI-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 12" id="iii.LI-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|15|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.12">Matt. xv.
12</scripRef>.</p></note>not the multitudes. For “His disciples,” so it is said,
“came and said unto Him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were
offended, when they heard the saying?” Yet surely nothing had
been said unto them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p52">What then saith Christ? He did not remove the offense in
respect of them, but reproved them, saying, “Every plant which my
heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.”<note n="1996" id="iii.LI-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p53"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 13" id="iii.LI-p53.1" parsed="|Matt|15|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.13">Matt. xv.
13</scripRef>.</p></note> For He is wont both to despise offenses, and not to despise them.
Elsewhere, for example, He saith, “But lest we should offend
them, cast an hook into the sea:”<note n="1997" id="iii.LI-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p54"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 27" id="iii.LI-p54.1" parsed="|Matt|17|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.27">Matt. xvii.
27</scripRef>.</p></note>but here He saith, “Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the
blind: and if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the
ditch.”<note n="1998" id="iii.LI-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p55"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 14" id="iii.LI-p55.1" parsed="|Matt|15|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.14">Matt. xv.

follows a briefer reading, but properly substitutes “a pit”
for “the ditch.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p56">But these things His disciples said, not as grieving for
those men only, but as being themselves also slightly perplexed. But
because they durst not say so in their own person, they would fain
learn it by their telling Him of others. And as to its being so, hear
how after this the ardent and ever-forward Peter came to Him, and
saith, “Declare unto us this parable,”<note n="1999" id="iii.LI-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p57"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 15" id="iii.LI-p57.1" parsed="|Matt|15|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.15">Matt. xv.
15</scripRef>.</p></note>discovering the trouble in his soul, and not indeed venturing to say
openly, “I am offended,” but requiring that by His
interpretation he should be freed from his perplexity; wherefore also
he was reproved.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p58">What then saith Christ? “Every plant which my
heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p59">This, they that are diseased with the Manichæan
pest affirm to be spoken of the law; but their months are stopped by
what had been said before. For if He was speaking of the law, how doth
He further back defend it, and fight for it, saying, “Why do ye
transgress the commandments of God for your tradition?” And how
doth He bring for

ward the prophet?
But of themselves and of their traditions He so speaks. For if God
said, “Honor thy father and thy mother,” how is not that of
God’s planting, which was spoken by God?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p60">And what follows also indicates, that of themselves it
was said, and of their traditions. Thus He added, “They are blind
leaders of the blind.” Whereas, had He spoken it of the law, He
would have said, “It is a blind leader of the blind.” But
not so did He speak, but, “They are blind leaders of the
blind:” freeing it from the blame, and bringing it all round upon
them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p61">Then to sever the people also from them, as being on the
point of falling into a pit by their means, He saith, “If the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p62">It is a great evil merely to be blind, but to be in such
a case and have none to lead him, nay, to occupy the place of a guide,
is a double and triple ground of censure. For if it be a dangerous
thing for the blind man not to have a guide, much more so that he
should even desire to be guide to another.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p63">What then saith Peter? He saith not, “What can
this be which Thou hast said?” but as though it were full of
obscurity, he puts his question. And he saith not, “Why hast thou
spoken contrary to the law?” for he was afraid, lest he should be
thought to have taken offense, but asserts it to be obscure. However,
that it was not obscure, but that he was offended, is manifest, for it
had nothing of obscurity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p64">Wherefore also He rebukes him, saying, “Are ye
also yet without understanding?”<note n="2000" id="iii.LI-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p65"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 16" id="iii.LI-p65.1" parsed="|Matt|15|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.16">Matt. xv.

saying; but themselves were the persons offended. Wherefore, whereas at
first, as though asking in behalf of the Pharisees, they were desirous
to be told; when they heard Him denouncing a great threat, and saying,
“Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be
rooted up,” and, “They are blind leaders of the
blind,” they were silenced. But he, always ardent, not even so
endures to hold his peace, but saith, “Declare unto us this
parable.”<note n="2001" id="iii.LI-p65.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p66"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 15" id="iii.LI-p66.1" parsed="|Matt|15|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.15">Matt. xv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p67">What then saith Christ? With a sharp rebuke He answers,
“Are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not yet
understand?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p68">But these things He said, and reproved them, in order to
cast out their prejudice; He stopped not however at this, but adds
other things also, saying, “That whatsoever entereth in at the
mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught; but those
things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and
they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, blasphemies,
false-witnessings: and these are the things that defile the man: but to
eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.”<note n="2002" id="iii.LI-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p69"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 17-20" id="iii.LI-p69.1" parsed="|Matt|15|17|15|20" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.17-Matt.15.20">Matt. xv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p70">Seest thou how sharply He deals with them, and in the
way of rebuke?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p71">Then He establishes His saying by our common nature, and
with a view to their cure. For when He saith, “It goeth into the
belly, and is cast out into the draught,” he is still answering
according to the low views of the Jews. For He saith, “it abides
not, but goes out:” and what if it abode? it would not make one
unclean. But not yet were they able to hear this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p72">And one may remark, that because of this the lawgiver
allows just so much time, as it may be remaining within one, but when
it is gone forth, no longer. For instance, at evening He bids you wash
yourself, and so be clean; measuring the time of the digestion, and of
the excretion.<note n="2003" id="iii.LI-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p73"><scripRef passage="Lev. xi. 24, 25" id="iii.LI-p73.1" parsed="|Lev|11|24|11|25" osisRef="Bible:Lev.11.24-Lev.11.25">Lev. xi.
24, 25</scripRef>.</p></note> But the things of the heart, He saith, abide within, and when they are
gone forth they defile, and not when abiding only. And first He puts
our evil thoughts, a kind of thing which belonged to the Jews; and not
as yet doth He make His refutation from the nature of the things, but
from the manner of production from the belly and the heart
respectively, and from the fact that the one sort remains, the other
not; the one entering in from without, and departing again outwards,
while the others are bred<note n="2004" id="iii.LI-p73.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p74">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LI-p74.1">τκτεται</span>; the Oxford

are gone forth. Because they were not yet able, as I said, to be taught
these things with all due strictness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p75">But Mark saith, that “cleansing the
meats,”<note n="2005" id="iii.LI-p75.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p76"><scripRef passage="Mark vii. 19" id="iii.LI-p76.1" parsed="|Mark|7|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.7.19">Mark vii.

on this passage of St. Matthew, refers also to St. Mark, where he reads

<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LI-p76.3">καθαρζον</span>. The word
“cleansing” or “purging” is therefore referred
to our Lord, and our Saviour’s words will stand as a parenthesis.
See Field <i>in loc</i>. [The translator doubtless means that this view
makes our Lord’s own words a parenthetical explanation of the
evangelist. So the R.V. gives the clause. That <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LI-p76.4">καθαρζων</span> is the
correct reading is quite certain, but German commentators refer it to

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p78">5. Let us learn then what are the things that defile the
man; let us learn, and let us flee them. For even in the church we see
such a custom prevailing amongst the generality, and men giving
diligence to come in clean garments, and to have their hands washed;
but how to present a clean soul to God, they make no account.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p79">And this I say, not forbidding them to wash hands or
mouth; but willing men so to wash as is meet, not with water only, but
instead of water, with all virtues. For the filth of the mouth is evil
speaking, blasphemy, reviling, angry words, filthy talking, laughter,
jesting: if then thou art conscious to thyself of uttering none of
them, neither of being defiled with this filth, draw near with
confidence; but if thou hast times out of number received these stains,
why dost thou labor in vain, washing thy tongue indeed with water, but
bearing about on it such deadly and hurtful filth? For tell me, hadst
thou dung on thy hands, and mire, wouldest thou indeed venture to pray?
By no means. And yet this were no hurt; but that is ruin. How then art
thou reverential in the different things, but in the forbidden
remiss?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p80">What then? should not we pray? saith one. We should
indeed, but not while defiled, and having upon us mire of that
sort.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p81">“What then, if I have been overtaken?” saith
one. Cleanse thyself. “How, and in what way?” Weep, groan,
give alms, apologize to him that is affronted, reconcile him to thyself
hereby, wipe clean thy tongue, lest thou provoke God more grievously.
For so if one had filled his hands with dung, and then should lay hold
of thy feet, entreating thee, far from hearing him, thou wouldest
rather spurn him with thy foot; how then durst thou in such sort draw
nigh to God? Since in truth the tongue is the hand of them that pray,
and by it we lay hold on the knees of God. Defile it not therefore,
lest to thee also He say, “Though ye make many prayers, I will
not hearken.”<note n="2007" id="iii.LI-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p82"><scripRef passage="Is. i. 15" id="iii.LI-p82.1" parsed="|Isa|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.1.15">Is. i.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p85">I bid thee then watch thy tongue more than the apple of
thine eye. The tongue is a royal steed. If then thou put a bridle on
it, and teach it to pace orderly, the King will rest and take His seat
thereon; but if thou suffer it to rush about unbridled and leap
wantonly, it becomes a beast for the devil and bad spirits to ride on.
And while thou, fresh from the company of thine own wife, darest not
pray, although this is no blame at all; dost thou lift up thine hands,
fresh from reviling and insult, which brings after it no less than
hell, before thou hast well cleansed thyself? And how dost thou not
shudder? tell me. Hast thou not heard Paul, saying, “Marriage is
honorable, and the bed undefiled?”<note n="2010" id="iii.LI-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p86"><scripRef passage="Heb. xiii. 4" id="iii.LI-p86.1" parsed="|Heb|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.13.4">Heb. xiii.

prayer, how dost thou coming from the bed of the devil call on that
awful and terrible name? For it is truly the devil’s bed, to
wallow in insults and reviling. And like some wicked adulterer, wrath
dallies with us in great delight, casting into us deadly seed, and
making us give birth to diabolical enmity, and doing all things in a
way opposite to marriage. For whereas marriage causes the two to become
one flesh, wrath severs into many parts them that were united, and
cleaves and cuts in pieces the very soul.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p87">That thou mayest therefore with confidence draw nigh to
God, receive not wrath, when it comes in upon thee, and desires to be
with thee, but drive it away like a mad dog.</p>

hath lost its proper confidence? but adorn it with gentleness, with

are approaching, and on whose behalf, and what we would accomplish. We
are drawing nigh unto God, whom the seraphim behold and turn away their
faces, not bearing His brightness; at sight of whom the earth trembles.
We draw nigh unto God, “who dwelleth in the light, which no man

tolerable punishments, for attaining to the Heavens, and to
the good things that are there. Let us, I say, fall down before Him
both in body and in mind, that He may raise us up when we are down; let
us converse with all gentleness and meekness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p96">And who is so wretched and miserable, one may say, as
not to become gentle in prayer? He that prays with an imprecation, and
fills himself with wrath, and cries out against his enemies.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p97">6. Nay, if thou wilt accuse, accuse thyself. If thou
wilt whet and sharpen thy tongue, let it be against thine own sins. And
tell not what evil another hath done to thee, but what thou hast done
to thyself; for this is most truly an evil; since no other will really
be able to injure thee, unless thou injure thyself. Wherefore, if thou
desire to be against them that wrong thee, approach as against thyself
first; there is no one to hinder; since by coming into court against
another, thou hast but the greater injury to go away with.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p98">And what injury at all hast thou really to mention? That
such an one insulted and spoiled thee by violence, and encompassed thee
with dangers? Nay, this is receiving not injury, but if we be sober,
the very greatest benefit; the injured being he that did such things,
not he that suffered them. And this is more than any one thing the
cause of all our evils, that we do not so much as know at all who is
the injured, and who the injurious person. Since if we knew this well,
we should not ever injure ourselves, we should not pray against
another, having learnt that it is impossible to suffer ill of another.
For not to be spoiled, but to spoil, is an evil. Wherefore, if thou
hast spoiled, accuse thyself; but if thou hast been spoiled, rather
pray for him that spoiled thee, because he hath done thee the greatest
good. For although the intent of the doer was not such, yet thou hast
received the greatest benefit, if thou hast endured it nobly. For him,
both men, and the laws of God declare to be wretched, but thee, the
injured party, they crown, and proclaim thy praise.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p99">For so if any one sick of a fever had violently taken
from any other a vessel containing water, and had had his fill of his
pernicious desire, we should not say that the despoiled had been
injured, but the spoiler; for he has aggravated his fever, and made his
disease more grievous. Now in this way I bid thee reason concerning him
also that loves wealth and money. For he too, having a far worse fever
than the other, has by this rapine fanned the flame in himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p100">Again, were some madman to snatch a sword from any one,
and destroy himself, which again is the injured? He that hath been
robbed, or the robber? It is quite clear, he that did the robbery.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p101">Well then, in the case of seizing property also, let us
give the same suffrage. For what a sword is to a madman, much the same
is wealth to a covetous man; nay, it is even a worse thing. For the
madman, when he has taken the sword, and thrust it through himself, is
both delivered from his madness, and hath no second blow to receive;
but the lover of money receives daily ten thousand wounds more grievous
than his, without delivering himself from his madness, but aggravating
it more exceedingly: and the more wounds he receives, the more doth he
give occasion for other more grievous blows.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p102">Reflecting then on these things, let us flee this sword;
let us flee the madness; though late, let us become temperate. For this
virtue too ought to be called temperance, not less than that which is
used to be so called among all men. For whereas there the dominion of
one lust is to be struggled against, here we have to master many lusts,
and those of all kinds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p103">Yea, nothing, nothing is more foolish<note n="2017" id="iii.LI-p103.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LI-p104"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LI-p104.1">ἀφρονστερον</span>

He thinks he is master, when he is a slave, and putting bonds on
himself, he rejoices; making the wild beast fiercer, he is pleased; and
becoming a captive, he prides himself, and leaps for joy; and seeing a
dog rabid and flying at his soul, when he ought to bind him and weaken
him by hunger, he actually supplies him with abundance of food, that he
may leap upon him more fiercely, and be more formidable.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LI-p105">Reflecting then on all these things, let us loose the
bonds, let us slay the monster, let us drive away the disease, let us
cast out this madness; that we may enjoy a calm and pure health, and
having with much pleasure sailed into the serene haven, may attain unto
the eternal blessings; unto which may we all attain, by the grace and
love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might,
now and always, and world without end. Amen.</p>

borders, and so it became possible for them to fall in with each other:
thus He saith, “Behold a woman of Canaan coming out of her own
coasts.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p14">The evangelist speaks against the woman, that he may
show forth her marvellous act, and celebrate her praise the more. For
when thou hearest of a Canaanitish woman, thou shouldest call to mind
those wicked nations, who overset from their foundations the very laws
of nature. And being reminded of these, consider also the power of
Christ’s advent. For they who were cast out, that they might not
pervert any Jews, these appeared so much better disposed than the Jews,
as even to come out of their coasts, and approach Christ; while those
were driving Him away, even on His coming unto them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p15">2. Having then come unto Him, she saith nothing else,
but “Have mercy on me,” and by her cry brings about them
many spectators. For indeed it was a pitiful spectacle to see a woman
crying aloud in so great affliction, and that woman a mother, and
entreating for a daughter, and for a daughter in such evil case: she
not even venturing to bring into the Master’s sight her that was
possessed, but leaving her to lie at home, and herself making the
entreaty.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p16">And she tells her affliction only, and adds nothing
more; neither doth she drag the physician to her house, like that
nobleman, saying, “Come and lay thy hand upon her,” and,
“Come down ere my child die.”<note n="2023" id="iii.LII-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p17">See <scripRef passage="John 4.49; Matt. 9.18" id="iii.LII-p17.1" parsed="|John|4|49|0|0;|Matt|9|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.49 Bible:Matt.9.18">John iv. 49, and comp.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p18">But having described both her calamity, and the
intensity of the disease, she pleads the Lord’s mercy, and cries
aloud; and she saith not, “Have mercy on my daughter,” but,
“Have mercy on me.” For she indeed is insensible of her
disease, but it is I that suffer her innumerable woes; my disease is
with consciousness, my madness with perception of itself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p19">2. “But He answered her not a word.”<note n="2024" id="iii.LII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 23" id="iii.LII-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|15|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.23">Matt. xv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p21">What is this new and strange thing? the Jews in their
perverseness He leads on, and

<pb n="312" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_312.html" id="iii.LII-Page_312" />

blaspheming He entreats them, and tempting Him He dismisses
them not; but to her, running unto Him, and entreating, and beseeching
Him, to her who had been educated neither in the law, nor in the
prophets, and was exhibiting so great reverence; to her He doth not
vouchsafe so much as an answer.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p22">Whom would not this have offended, seeing the facts so
opposite to the report? For whereas they had heard, that He went about
the villages healing, her, when she had come to Him, He utterly repels.
And who would not have been moved by her affliction, and by the
supplication she made for her daughter in such evil case? For not as
one worthy, nor as demanding a due, not so did she approach Him, but
she entreated that she might find mercy, and merely gave a lamentable
account of her own affliction; yet is she not counted worthy of so much
as an answer.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p23">Perhaps many of the hearers were offended, but she was
not offended. And why say I, of the hearers? For I suppose that even
the very disciples must have been in some degree affected at the
woman’s affliction, and have been greatly troubled, and out of
heart.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p24">Nevertheless not even in this trouble did they venture
to say, “Grant her this favor,” but, “His disciples
came and besought Him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth after
us.” For we too, when we wish to persuade any one, oftentimes say
the contrary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p25">But Christ saith, “I am not sent, but unto the
lost sheep of the house of Israel.”<note n="2025" id="iii.LII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p26"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 24" id="iii.LII-p26.1" parsed="|Matt|15|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.24">Matt. xv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p27">What then did the woman, after she heard this? Was she
silent, and did she desist? or did she relax her earnestness? By no
means, but she was the more instant. But it is not so with us; rather,
when we fail to obtain, we desist; whereas it ought to make us the more
urgent.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p28">And yet, who would not have been driven to perplexity by
the word which was then spoken? Why His silence were enough to drive
her to despair, but His answer did so very much more. For together with
herself, to see them also in utter perplexity that were pleading with
her, and to hear that the thing is even impossible to be done, was
enough to cast her into unspeakable perplexity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p29">Yet nevertheless the woman was not perplexed, but on
seeing her advocates prevail nothing, she made herself shameless with a
goodly shamelessness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p30">For whereas before this she had not ventured so much as
to come in sight (for “she crieth,” it is said,
“after us”), when one might expect that she should rather
depart further off in utter despair, at that very time she comes
nearer, and worships, saying, “Lord, help me.”<note n="2026" id="iii.LII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 25" id="iii.LII-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|15|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.25">Matt. xv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p32">What is this, O woman? Hast thou then greater confidence
than the apostles? more abundant strength? “Confidence and
strength,” saith she, “by no means; nay, I am even full of
shame. Yet nevertheless my very shamelessness do I put forward for
entreaty; He will respect my confidence.” And what is this?
Heardest thou not Him saying, “I am not sent but unto the lost
sheep of the house of Israel?” “I heard,” saith she,
“but He Himself is Lord.” Wherefore neither did she say,
“Entreat and beseech,” but, “Help me.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p33">3. What then saith Christ? Not even with all this was He
satisfied, but He makes her perplexity yet more intense again,
saying,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p34">“It is not meet to take the children’s bread
and to cast it to the dogs.”<note n="2027" id="iii.LII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p35"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 26" id="iii.LII-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|15|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.26">Matt. xv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p36">And when He vouchsafed her a word, then He smote her
more sharply than by His silence. And no longer doth He refer the cause
to another, nor say, “I am not sent,” but the more urgent
she makes her entreaty, so much the more doth He also urge His denial.
And He calls them no longer “sheep,” but
“children,” and her “a dog.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p37">What then saith the woman? Out of His own very words she
frames her plea. “Why, though I be a dog,” said she,
“I am not an alien.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p38">Justly did Christ say, “For judgment am I
come.”<note n="2028" id="iii.LII-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p39"><scripRef passage="John ix. 32" id="iii.LII-p39.1" parsed="|John|9|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.32">John ix.
32</scripRef>.</p></note> The woman practises high self-command, and shows forth all endurance
and faith, and this, receiving insult; but they, courted and honored,
requite it with the contrary.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p40">For, “that food is necessary for the
children,” saith she, “I also know; yet neither am I
forbidden, being a dog. For were it unlawful to receive, neither would
it be lawful to partake of the crumbs; but if, though in scanty
measure, they ought to be partakers, neither am I forbidden, though I
be a dog; nay, rather on this ground am I most surely a partaker, if I
am a dog.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p41">With this intent did Christ put her off, for He knew she
would say this; for this did He deny the grant, that He might exhibit
her high self-command.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p42">For if He had not meant to give, neither would He have
given afterwards, nor would He have stopped her mouth again. But as He
doth in the case of the centurion, saying, “I will come and heal
him,”<note n="2029" id="iii.LII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 7" id="iii.LII-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|8|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.7">Matt. viii.

hid. Not in insult then were His words spoken, but calling her forth,
and revealing the treasure laid up in her.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p47">But do thou, I pray thee, together with her faith see
also her humility. For He had called the Jews “children,”
but she was not satisfied with this, but even called them
“masters;” so far was she from grieving at the praises of
others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p48">“Why, the dogs also,”<note n="2033" id="iii.LII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p49">[R.V., “for even the dogs,” etc.]</p></note>saith she, “eat of the crumbs that fall from their master’s

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p51">Seest thou the woman’s wisdom, how she did not
venture so much as to say a word against it, nor was stung by other
men’s praises, nor was indignant at the reproach? Seest thou her
constancy? He said, “It is not meet,” and she said,
“Truth, Lord;” He called them “children,” but
she “masters;” He used the name of a dog, but she added
also the dog’s act. Seest thou this woman’s humility?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p52">Hear the proud language of the Jews. “We be

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p57">“Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.” Now
what He saith is like this: “Thy faith indeed is able to effect
even greater things than these; nevertheless, Be it unto thee even as
thou wilt.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p58">This was akin to that voice that said, “Let the

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p60">“And her daughter was made whole from that very
hour.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p61">Seest thou how this woman too contributed not a little
to the healing of her daughter? For to this purpose neither did Christ
say, “Let thy little daughter be made whole,” but,
“Great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt;” to
teach thee that the words were not used at random, nor were they
flattering words, but great was the power of her faith.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p62">The certain test, however, and demonstration thereof, He
left to the issue of events. Her daughter accordingly was straightway
healed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p63">But mark thou, I pray thee, how when the apostles had
failed, and had not succeeded, this woman had success. So great a thing
is assiduity in prayer. Yea, He had even rather be solicited by us,
guilty as we are, for those who belong to us, than by others in our
behalf. And yet they had more liberty to speak; but she exhibited much
endurance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p64">And by the issue He also excused Himself to His
disciples for the delay, and showed that with reason He had not
assented to their request.</p>

unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into the mountain, and sat down
there. And great multitudes came unto Him, having with them those that
were lame, blind, maimed, dumb; and cast them<note n="2039" id="iii.LII-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p66">[“cast them down.”]</p></note>at His feet; and He healed them, insomuch that the multitudes wondered,
when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to
walk, and the blind to see, and they glorified the God of
Israel.”<note n="2040" id="iii.LII-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p67"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 29-31" id="iii.LII-p67.1" parsed="|Matt|15|29|15|31" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.29-Matt.15.31">Matt. xv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p68">Now He goes about Himself, now sits awaiting the
diseased, and hath the lame brought up unto the mountain. And no longer
do they touch so much as His garment, but advance a higher step, being
cast at His feet: and they showed their faith doubly, first, by going
up into the mountain though lame, then by wanting nothing else but to
be cast at His feet only.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p69">And great was the marvel and strange, to see them that
were carried walking, the blind needing not any to lead them by the
hand. Yea, both the multitude of the healed, and the facility of their
cure amazed them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p70">Seest thou, how the woman indeed He healed with so much
delay, but these immediately? not because these are better than she is,
but because she is more faithful than they. Therefore, while in her
case He defers and delays, to manifest her constancy; on these He
bestows the gift immediately, stopping the mouths of the unbelieving
Jews, and cutting away from them every plea. For the greater favors one
hath received, so much the more is he liable to punishment, if he be
insensible, and the very honor make him no

better. Therefore you see the rich also proving
wicked, are more punished than the poor, for not being softened even by
their prosperity. For tell me not that they gave alms. Since if they
gave not in proportion to their substance, not even so shall they
escape; our alms being judged not by the measure of our gifts, but by
the largeness<note n="2041" id="iii.LII-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p71"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LII-p71.1">δαψιλε</span>.</p></note>of our mind. But if these suffer punishment, much more they that are
eager about unnecessary things; who build houses of two and three
stories, but despise the hungry; who give heed to covetousness, but
neglect alms-giving.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p72">5. But since the discourse hath fallen on almsgiving,
come then, let us resume again to-day that argument, which I was making
three days ago concerning benevolence, and left unfinished. Ye
remember, when lately I was speaking of vanity about your shoes, and of
that empty trouble, and the luxury of the young, that it was from
almsgiving that our discourse passed on to those charges <i>against
you</i>. What were the matters then at that time brought forward? That
almsgiving is a kind of art, having its workshop in Heaven, and for its
teacher, not man, but God. Then inquiring what is an art, and what not
an art, we came upon fruitless labors, and evil devices, amongst which
we made mention also of this art concerning men’s shoes.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p73">Have ye then recalled it to mind? Come now, let us
to-day also resume what we then said, and let us show how almsgiving is
an art, and better than all arts. For if the peculiarity of art is to
issue in something useful, and nothing is more useful than almsgiving,
very evidently this is both an art, and better than all arts. For it
makes for us not shoes, nor doth it weave garments, nor build houses
that are of clay; but it procures life everlasting, and snatches us
from the hands of death, and in either life shows us glorious, and
builds the mansions that are in Heaven, and those eternal
tabernacles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p74">This suffers not our lamps to go out, nor that we should
appear at the marriage having filthy garments, but washes them, and
renders them purer than snow. “For though your sins be as
scarlet, I will make them white as snow.”<note n="2042" id="iii.LII-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p75"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LII-p75.1">θλω</span>.]</p></note><i>not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the
way.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.LII-p76"><span class="c11" id="iii.LII-p76.1">Both</span> above, when going to do
this miracle, He first healed them that were maimed in body, and here
He doth the self-same thing; from the healing of the blind and the
lame, He goes on to this again.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p77">But why might it be, that then His disciples said,
“Send away the multitude,” but now they said not so; and
this, though three days had past? Either being themselves improved by
this time, or seeing that the people had no great sense of hunger; for
they were glorifying God for the things that were done.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p78">But see how in this instance too He doth not proceed at
once to the miracle, but calls them forth thereunto. For the multitudes
indeed who had come out for healing durst not ask for the loaves; but
He, the benevolent and provident one, gives even to them that ask not,
and saith unto His disciples, “I have compassion, and will not
send them away fasting.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p79">For lest they should say that they came

<pb n="315" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_315.html" id="iii.LII-Page_315" />

having provisions for the way, He saith,
“They continue with me now three days;” so that even if
they came having any, it is all spent. For therefore He Himself did not
this on the first and second day, but when all had been consumed by
them, in order that having first been in want, they might more eagerly
accept His work.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p80">Therefore He saith, “Lest they faint in the
way;” implying both their distance to be great, and that they had
nothing left.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p81">“Then, if thou art not willing to send them away
fasting, wherefore dost thou not work the miracle?” That by this
question and by their answer He might make the disciples more heedful,
and that they might show forth their faith, coming unto Him, and
saying, “Make loaves.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p82">But not even so did they understand the motive of His
question; wherefore afterwards He saith to them, as Mark relates,
“Are your hearts so hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? and having
ears, hear ye not?”<note n="2043" id="iii.LII-p82.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p83"><scripRef passage="Mark viii. 17, 18" id="iii.LII-p83.1" parsed="|Mark|8|17|8|18" osisRef="Bible:Mark.8.17-Mark.8.18">Mark viii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p84">Since, if this were not so, wherefore doth He speak to
the disciples, and signify the multitude’s worthiness to receive
a benefit, and add also the pity He Himself feels?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p85">But Matthew saith, that after this He also rebuked them,
saying, “O ye of little faith, do ye not yet understand, nor
remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye
took up? nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
baskets ye took up?”<note n="2044" id="iii.LII-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p86"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 8-10" id="iii.LII-p86.1" parsed="|Matt|16|8|16|10" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.8-Matt.16.10">Matt. xvi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p87">What then say the disciples? Still they creep on the
ground, although He had done so very many things in order that that
miracle might be kept in memory; as by His question, and by the answer,
and by making them minister herein, and by distributing the baskets;
but their state of mind was yet rather imperfect.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p90">Both before this, and now, they make mention of the
wilderness; themselves in a weak way of argument so speaking, yet even
hereby putting the miracle above suspicion. That is, lest any should
affirm (as I have indeed already said), that they obtained it from some
neighboring village, the place is acknowledged, that the miracle may be
believed. With this view, both the former miracle and this He works in
a wilderness, at a great distance from the villages.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p91">The disciples, considering none of all this, said,
“Whence should we have so many loaves in a wilderness?” For
they thought verily He had said it as purposing next to enjoin them to
feed the people; most foolishly; since with this intent He had said,
and that lately, “Give ye them to eat,”<note n="2046" id="iii.LII-p91.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p92"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 16" id="iii.LII-p92.1" parsed="|Matt|14|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.16">Matt. xiv.
16</scripRef>.</p></note>that He might bring them to an urgent need of entreating Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p93">But now He saith not this, “Give ye them to
eat,” but what? “I have compassion on them, and will not
send them away fasting;” bringing the disciples nearer, and
provoking them more, and granting them clearer sight, to ask these
things of Him. For in truth they were the words of one signifying that
He hath power not to send them away fasting; of one manifesting His
authority. For the expression, “I will not,” implies such a
purpose in Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p94">2. Since however they still spake of the multitude
merely, and the place, and the wilderness (for “whence,” it
is said, “should we have in a wilderness so many loaves, as to
fill so great a multitude”?); and not even so understood what He
said, He proceeds to contribute His own part, and saith unto them,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p95">“How many loaves have ye? And they say, Seven, and
a few little fishes.”<note n="2047" id="iii.LII-p95.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p96"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 34" id="iii.LII-p96.1" parsed="|Matt|15|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.34">Matt. xv.

many?”<note n="2048" id="iii.LII-p97.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p98"><scripRef passage="John vi. 9" id="iii.LII-p98.1" parsed="|John|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.6.9">John vi.

meaning, yet nevertheless they became higher by degrees. For so He too,
arousing their mind hereby, puts the question much as He had done
before, that by the very form of the inquiry He might remind them of
the works already done.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p99">But as thou hast seen their imperfection hereby, so do
thou observe the severity of their spirit, and admire their love of
truth, how, writing themselves, they conceal not their own defects,
great as they were. For it was no small blame to have presently
forgotten this miracle, which had so recently taken place; wherefore
they are also rebuked.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p100">And herewith consider also their strictness in another
matter, how they were conquerors of their appetite; how disciplined to
make little account of their diet. For being in the wilderness and
abiding there three days, they had seven loaves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p101">Now all the rest He doth as on the former occasion; thus
He both makes them sit down on the ground, and He makes the loaves
multiply themselves in the hands of the disciples.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p102">For, “He commanded,” it is said, “the

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p108">But why at the former time, when there were five
thousand, did twelve baskets full remain over and above, whereas here,
when there were four thousand, it was seven baskets full? For what
purpose, I say, and by what cause, were the remnants less, the guests
not being so many?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p109">Either then one may say this, that the baskets on this

cast them into forgetfulness, He rouses their recollection by the
difference, that by the variation they might be reminded of both one
and the other. Accordingly, in that case, He makes the baskets full of
fragments equal in number to His disciples, in this, the other baskets
equal to the loaves; indicating even hereby His unspeakable power, and
the ease wherewith He exercised His authority, in that it was possible
for Him to work such miracles, both in this way and in the other. For
neither was it of small power, to maintain the exact number, both then
and now; then when there were five thousand, now when there were four
thousand; and not suffer the remnants to be more than the baskets used
on the one occasion or on the other, although the number of the guests
was different.</p>

these signs which are on the earth, but those in Heaven are stored up
against that time. Now as a physician am I come, then I shall be here
as a judge; now to seek that which is gone astray, then to demand an

His will is to remind them of what had been done, for He knew they had

reasonable ground, but to take the occasion from themselves, and so to
reprove them, would make the charge admissible. “And why did He
not then reprove them, when they said, ‘Whence should we have so
many loaves in the wilderness?’ for it seemed a good time then to
say what He says here.” That He might not seem to rush hastily on
the miracle. And besides, He would not blame them before the multitude,

founder of the city? Because there was another besides, Cæsarea
Stratonis. But not in that, but in this doth He ask them, leading them
far away from the Jews, so that being freed from all alarm, they might
speak with boldness all that was in their mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p157">And wherefore did He not ask them at once their own
opinion, but that of the people? In order that when they had told the
people’s opinion, and then were asked, “But whom<note n="2076" id="iii.LII-p157.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p158">[The A.V. is ungrammatical; “whom” is
simply a transfer of the Greek accusative (with the infinitive in the
passage) into the English finite clause.—R.]</p></note>say ye that I am?” by the manner of His inquiry they might be led
up to a sublimer notion, and not fall into the same low view as the
multitude. Accordingly He asks them not at all in the beginning of His
preaching, but when He had done many miracles, and had discoursed with
them of many and high doctrines, and had afforded so many clear proofs
of His Godhead, and of His unanimity with the Father, then He puts this
question to them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p159">And He said not, “Whom say the Scribes and
Pharisees that I am?” often as these had come unto Him, and
discoursed with Him; but, “Whom do men say that I am?”
inquiring after the judgment of the people, as unbiassed. For though it
was far meaner than it should be, yet was it free from malice, but the
other was teeming with much wickedness.</p>

denoting His Godhead, which He doth also in many other places. For He
saith, “No man hath ascended up to Heaven, but the Son of Man,
which is in Heaven.”<note n="2078" id="iii.LII-p161.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p162"><scripRef passage="John iii. 13" id="iii.LII-p162.1" parsed="|John|3|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.13">John iii.

imagination concerning Him, and indicating that their former judgment
falls exceedingly short of His dignity. Wherefore He seeks for another
judgment from themselves, and puts a second question, that they might

greater than human, accounted Him a man indeed, but one that had
appeared after a resurrection, as Herod also said.<note n="2082" id="iii.LII-p166.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p167"><scripRef passage="Matt. xiv. 2" id="iii.LII-p167.1" parsed="|Matt|14|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.14.2">Matt. xiv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p178">Why then is this man blessed? Because he acknowledged
Him very Son. Wherefore you see, that while in those former instances
He had said no such thing, in this case He also signifies who had
revealed it. That is, lest his words might seem to the many (because he
was an earnest lover of Christ) to be words of friendship and flattery,

“I am the Christ,” but by His question establish this,
bringing them in to confess it? Because so to do was both more suitable
to Him, yea necessary at that time, and it drew them on the more to the
belief of the things that were said.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p181">Seest thou how the Father reveals the Son, how the Son

“Thou art Son of Jonas;” but since he had said, “Son
of God,” to point out that He is so Son of God, as the other son
of Jonas, of the same substance with Him that begat Him, therefore He
added this, “And I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this
rock will I build my Church;”<note n="2092" id="iii.LII-p184.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p185"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 18" id="iii.LII-p185.1" parsed="|Matt|16|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.18">Matt. xvi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p193">Seest thou how He, His own self, leads Peter on to high
thoughts of Him, and reveals Himself, and implies that He is Son of God

all the world is at war with him), these He promises Himself to give;

the dignity of the Son, which manner of gifts were greater, those which
the Father gave to Peter, or those which the Son gave him? For the
Father gave to Peter the revelation of the Son; but the Son gave him to
sow that of the Father and that of Himself in every part of the world;
and to a mortal man He entrusted the authority over all things in
Heaven, giving him the keys; who extended the church to every part of
the world, and declared it to be stronger than heaven. “For

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p203">And why did He charge them? That when the things which
offend are taken out of the way, and the cross is accomplished, and the
rest of His sufferings fulfilled, and when there is nothing any more to
interrupt and disturb the faith of the people in Him, the right opinion
concerning Him may be engraven pure and immovable in the mind of the
hearers. For, in truth, His power had not yet clearly shone forth.
Accordingly it was His will then to be preached by them, when both the
plain truth of the facts, and the power of His deeds were pleading in
support of the assertions of the apostles. For it was by no means the
same thing to see Him in Palestine, now working miracles, and now
insulted and persecuted (and especially when the very cross was
presently to follow the miracles that were happening); and to behold
him everywhere in the world, adored and believed, and no more suffering
anything, such as He had suffered.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p204">Therefore He bids them “tell no man.” For
that which hath been once rooted and then plucked up, would hardly, if
planted, again be retained among the many; but that which, once fixed,
hath remained immovable, and hath suffered injury from no quarter,
easily mounts up, and advances to a greater growth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p205">And if they who had enjoyed the benefit of many
miracles, and had had part in so many unutterable mysteries, were
offended by the mere hearing of it; or rather not these only, but even
the leader<note n="2103" id="iii.LII-p205.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p206"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LII-p206.1">ὁ κορυφαο</span>.</p></note>of them all, Peter; consider what it was likely the common sort should
feel, being first told that He is the Son of God, then seeing Him even
crucified and spit upon, and that without knowledge of the secret of
those mysteries, or participation in the gift of the Holy Ghost. For if
to His disciples He said, “I have many things to say unto you,
but ye cannot bear them now;”<note n="2104" id="iii.LII-p206.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p207"><scripRef passage="John xvi. 12" id="iii.LII-p207.1" parsed="|John|16|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.16.12">John xvi.
12</scripRef>.</p></note>much more would the rest of the people have utterly failed, had the
chiefest of these mysteries been revealed to them before the proper
time. Accordingly He forbids them to tell.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p208">And to instruct thee how great a thing it was, their
afterwards learning His doctrine complete, when the things that offend
had passed by; learn it from this same leader of theirs. For this very
Peter, he who after so many miracles proved so weak as even to deny
Him, and to be in fear of a mean damsel; after the cross had come
forth, and he had received the certain proofs of the resurrection, and
there was nothing more to offend and trouble him, retained the teaching
of the Spirit so immovable, that more vehemently than a lion he sprang
upon the people of the Jews, for all the dangers and innumerable deaths
which were threatened.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p209">With reason then did He bid them not tell the many
before the crucifixion, since not even to them that were to teach did
He venture to commit all before the crucifixion. “For I have many
things to say unto you,” saith He, “but ye cannot bear them
now.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p210">And of the things too that He did say, they do not
understand many, which He did not make plain before the crucifixion. At
least when He was risen from the dead, then and not before they knew
some of His sayings.</p>

mystery could be. For they did not even know what was this same rising

being troubled and in perplexity, Peter again, in his ardor, alone
ventures to discourse of these things; and not even he openly, but when
he had taken Him apart; that is, having separated himself from the rest
of the disciples; and he saith, “Be it far from Thee, Lord, this

passion? And what marvel, that one who had not on these points received
any revelation, should have that feeling? Yea, to inform thee that not
of himself did he speak those other things either, see in these matters
that were not revealed to him how he is confounded and overthrown, and
being told ten thousand times, knows not what the saying can mean.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p219">For that He is Son of God he had learnt, but what the
mystery of the cross and of the resurrection might be, was not yet
manifest to him: for “the saying,” it is said, “was
hid from them.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p220">Seest thou that with just cause He bade them not declare
it to the rest? For if it so confounded them, who must needs be made
aware of it, what would not all others have felt?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p221">6. He however, to signify that He is far from coming to
the passion against His will, both rebuked Peter, and called him
Satan.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p222">Let them hear, as many as are ashamed of the suffering
of the cross of Christ. For if the chief apostle, even before he had
learnt all distinctly, was called Satan for feeling this, what excuse
can they have, who after so abundant proof deny His economy? I say,
when he who had been so blessed, who made such a confession, has such
words addressed to him; consider what they will suffer, who after all
this deny the mystery of the cross.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p223">And He said not, “Satan spake by thee,” but,
“Get thee behind me, Satan.”<note n="2110" id="iii.LII-p223.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p224"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 23" id="iii.LII-p224.1" parsed="|Matt|16|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.23">Matt. xvi.
23</scripRef>.</p></note> For indeed it was a desire of the adversary that Christ should not
suffer. Therefore with such great severity did He rebuke him, as
knowing that both he and the rest are especially afraid of this, and
will not easily receive it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p225">Therefore He also reveals the thoughts of his mind,
saying, “Thou savorest<note n="2111" id="iii.LII-p225.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p226">[R.V., “mindest.”]</p></note>not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p227">But what means, “Thou savorest<note n="2112" id="iii.LII-p227.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p228">[R.V., “mindest.”]</p></note>not the things that be of God, but those that be of men”? Peter
examining the matter by human and earthly reasoning, accounted it
disgraceful to Him and an unmeet thing. Touching him therefore
sharply,<note n="2113" id="iii.LII-p228.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p229"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LII-p229.1">καθικνομενο</span>.</p></note> He saith, “My passion is not an unmeet thing, but thou givest
this sentence with a carnal mind; whereas if thou hadst hearkened to my
sayings in a godly manner, disengaging thyself from thy carnal
understanding, thou wouldest know that this of all things most becometh
me. For thou indeed supposest that to suffer is unworthy of me; but I
say unto thee, that for me not to suffer is of the devil’s
mind;” by the contrary statements repressing his alarm.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p230">Thus as John, accounting it unworthy of Christ to be
baptized by him, was persuaded of Christ to baptize Him, He saying,
“Thus it becometh us,”<note n="2114" id="iii.LII-p230.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p231"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 15" id="iii.LII-p231.1" parsed="|Matt|3|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.15">Matt. iii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note>and this same Peter too, forbidding Him to wash his feet, by the words,
“Thou hast no part with me, unless I wash thy feet;”<note n="2115" id="iii.LII-p231.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p232"><scripRef passage="John xiii. 8" id="iii.LII-p232.1" parsed="|John|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.13.8">John xiii.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>even so here too He restrained him by the mention of the opposite, and
by the severity of the reproof repressed his fear of suffering.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p233">7. Let no man therefore be ashamed of the honored
symbols of our salvation, and of the chiefest of all good things,
whereby we even live, and whereby we are; but as a crown, so let us
bear about the cross of Christ. Yea, for by it all things are wrought,
that are wrought among us. Whether one is to be new-born, the cross is
there; or to be nourished with that mystical food, or to be ordained,
or to do anything else, everywhere our symbol of victory is present.
Therefore both on house, and walls, and windows, and upon our forehead,
and upon our mind, we inscribe it with much care.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p234">For of the salvation wrought for us, and of our common
freedom, and of the goodness of our Lord, this is the sign. “For
as a

and quench anger, and all the other passions. When thou signest
thyself, fill thy forehead with all courage, make thy soul free. And ye
know assuredly what are the things that give freedom. Wherefore also
Paul leading us there, I mean unto the freedom that beseems us, did on
this wise lead us unto it, having reminded us of the cross and blood of
our Lord. “For ye are bought,” saith he, “with a
price; be not ye the servants of men.”<note n="2117" id="iii.LII-p235.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p236"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 23" id="iii.LII-p236.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.23">1 Cor. vii.
23</scripRef>. [R.V., “become not
bondservants of men.”]</p></note> Consider, saith he, the price that hath been paid for thee, and thou
wilt be a slave to no man; by the price meaning the cross.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p237">Since not merely by the fingers ought one to engrave it,
but before this by the purpose of the heart with much faith. And if in
this way thou hast marked it on thy face, none of the unclean spirits
will be able to stand near thee, seeing the blade whereby he received
his wound, seeing the sword which gave him his mortal stroke. For if
we, on seeing the places in which the criminals are beheaded, shudder;
think what the devil must endure, seeing the weapon, whereby Christ put
an end to all his power, and cut off the head of the dragon.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p238">Be not ashamed then of so great a blessing, lest Christ
be ashamed of thee, when He comes with His glory, and the sign appears
before Him, shining beyond the very sunbeam.<note n="2118" id="iii.LII-p238.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p239">See S. Cyril, <i>Catech</i>. xiii. 41. Oxf. Trans.

and pleading with the whole world for our Lord, and signifying that no
part hath failed of what pertained to Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p240">This sign, both in the days of our forefathers and now,

venomous beasts. For if it opened the gates of hell, and threw wide the
archways of Heaven, and made a new entrance into Paradise, and cut away
the nerves of the devil; what marvel, if it prevailed over poisonous
drugs, and venomous beasts, and all other such things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p243">This therefore do thou engrave upon thy mind, and
embrace the salvation of our souls. For this cross saved and converted
the world, drove away error, brought back truth, made earth Heaven,
fashioned men into angels. Because of this, the devils are no longer
terrible, but contemptible; neither is death, death, but a sleep;
because of this, all that warreth against us is cast to the ground, and
trodden under foot.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p244">If any one therefore say to thee, Dost thou worship the
crucified? say, with your voice all joy, and your countenance
gladdened, “I do both worship Him, and will never cease to
worship.” And if he laugh, weep for him, because he is mad. Thank
the Lord, that He hath bestowed on us such benefits, as one cannot so
much as learn without His revelation from above. Why, this is the very
reason of his laughing, that “the natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit.”<note n="2121" id="iii.LII-p244.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p245"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. ii. 14" id="iii.LII-p245.1" parsed="|1Cor|2|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.14">1 Cor. ii.

marvellous things; and if thou bring a child into the mysteries, he
will laugh. Now the heathen are like these children; or rather they are
more imperfect even than these; wherefore also they are more wretched,
in that not in an immature age, but when full grown, they have the
feelings of babes; wherefore neither are they worthy of indulgence.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p246">But let us with a clear voice, shouting both loud and
high, cry out and say (and should all the heathen be present, so much
the more confidently), that the cross is our glory, and the sum of all
our blessings, and our confidence, and all our crown. I would that also
with Paul I were able to say, “By which the world is crucified
unto me, and I unto the world;”<note n="2122" id="iii.LII-p246.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p247"><scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 14" id="iii.LII-p247.1" parsed="|Gal|6|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.14">Gal. vi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p248">8. Wherefore I admonish both you, and surely before you
myself, to be crucified to the world, and to have nothing in common
with the earth, but to set your love on your country above, and the
glory and the good things that come from it. For indeed we are soldiers
of a heavenly King, and are clad with spiritual arms. Why then take we
upon ourselves the life of traders, and mountebanks, nay rather of
worms? For where the King is, there should also the soldier be. Yea, we
are become soldiers, not of them that are far off, but of them that are
near. For the earthly king indeed would not endure that all should be
in the royal courts, and at his own side, but the King of the Heavens
willeth all to be near His royal throne.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p249">And how, one may say, is it possible for us, being here,
to stand by that throne? Because Paul too being on earth was where the
seraphim, where the cherubim are; and nearer to Christ, than these the
body guards to the king. For these turn about their faces in many
directions, but him nothing beguiled

intent upon the king. So that if we would, this is possible to us
also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p250">For were He distant from us in place, thou mightest well
doubt, but if He is present everywhere, to him that strives and is in
earnest He is near. Wherefore also the prophet said, “I will fear

call her? There is not one, no father, no mother: but God stands
continually waiting, if any of his servants should perchance call Him;
and never, when we have called as we ought, hath He refused to hear.
Therefore He saith, “While thou art yet speaking,” I do not
wait for thee to finish, and I straightway hearken.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p254">9. Let us call Him therefore, as it is His will to be
called. But what is this His will? “Loose,” saith He,
“every band of iniquity, unloose the twisted knots of oppressive
covenants, tear in pieces every unjust contract. Break thy bread to the
hungry, and bring in the poor that are cast out to thy house. If thou
seest one naked, cover him, and them that belong to thy seed thou shalt
not overlook. Then shall thy light break forth in the morning, and
thine healings shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness shall
go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall cover thee. Then thou
shalt call upon me, and I will give ear unto thee; whilst thou art yet
speaking, I will say, Lo! here I am.”<note n="2126" id="iii.LII-p254.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p255"><scripRef passage="Is. lviii. 6-9" id="iii.LII-p255.1" parsed="|Isa|58|6|58|9" osisRef="Bible:Isa.58.6-Isa.58.9">Is. lviii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p256">And who is able to do all this? it may be asked. Nay,
who is unable, I pray thee? For which is difficult of the things I have
mentioned? Which is laborious? Which not easy?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p257">Why, so entirely are they not possible only, but even
easy, that many have actually overshot the measure of those sayings,
not only tearing in pieces unjust contracts, but even stripping
themselves of all their goods; making the poor welcome not to roof and
table, but even to the sweat of their body, and laboring in order to
maintain them; doing good not to kinsmen only, but even to enemies.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p258">But what is there at all even hard in these sayings? For
neither did He say, “Pass over the mountain, go across the sea,
dig through so many acres of land, abide without food, wrap thyself in
sackcloth;” but, “Impart to the poor,<note n="2127" id="iii.LII-p258.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p259">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LII-p259.1">το

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p260">What is more easy than this? tell me. But even if thou
account it difficult, look, I pray thee, at the rewards also, and it
shall be easy to thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p261">For much as our emperors at the horse races heap
together before the combatants crowns, and prizes, and garments, even
so Christ also sets His rewards in the midst of His course, holding
them out by the prophet’s words, as it were by many hands. And
the emperors, although they be ten thousand times emperors, yet as
being men, and the wealth which they have in a course of spending, and
their munificence of exhaustion, are ambitious of making the little
appear much; wherefore also they commit each thing severally into the
hand of the several attendants, and so bring it forward. But our King
contrariwise, having heaped all together (because He is very rich, and
doeth nothing for display), He so brings it forward, and what He so
reaches out is indefinitely great, and will need many hands to hold it.
And to make thee aware of this, examine each particular of it
carefully.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p262">“Then,” saith He, “shall thy light
break forth in the morning.”<note n="2128" id="iii.LII-p262.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LII-p263">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LII-p263.1">πρωμον</span>, explained below. Our

nay, for it hath many things in it, both prizes, and crowns, and other
rewards. And, if ye are minded, let us take it to pieces and show all
its wealth, as it shall be possible for us to show it; only do not ye
grow weary.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p264">And first, let us learn the meaning of “It shall
break forth.” For He said not at all, “shall appear,”
but “shall break forth;” declaring to us its quickness and
plentifulness, and how exceedingly He desires our salvation, and how
the good things themselves travail to come forth, and press on; and
that which would check their unspeakable force shall be nought; by all
which He indicates their plentifulness, and the infinity of His
abundance. But what is “the morning.” It means, “not
after being in life’s temptations, neither after our evils have
come upon us;” nay, it is quite beforehand with them. For as in
our fruits, we call that early, which has shown itself before its
season; so also here again, declaring its rapidity, he has spoken

<pb n="324" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_324.html" id="iii.LII-Page_324" />

in this way, much as above He said,
“Whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo! here I
am.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p265">But of what manner of light is He speaking, and what can
this light be? Not this, that is sensible; but another far better,
which shows us Heaven, the angels, the archangels, the cherubim, the
seraphim, the thrones, the dominions, the principalities, the powers,
the whole host, the royal palaces, the tabernacles. For shouldest thou
be counted worthy of this light, thou shalt both see these, and be
delivered from hell, and from the venomous worm, and from the gnashing
of teeth, and from the bonds that cannot be broken, and from the
anguish and the affliction, from the darkness that hath no light, and
from being cut asunder, and from the river of fire, and from the curse,

set forth by one expression, and how He brought all together?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LII-p269">So also by unfolding each of the expressions that
follow, we shall find our abundance great, and the ocean immense. Shall
we then still delay, I beg you; and be backward to show mercy on them
that are in need? Nay, I entreat, but though we must throw away all, be
cast into the fire, venture against the sword, leap upon daggers,
suffer what you will; let us bear all easily, that we may obtain the
garment of the kingdom of Heaven, and that untold glory; which may we
all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory and might, world without end. Amen.</p>

also more abundantly to show both the extravagance of what Peter had
said, and the benefit of His passion, He saith, “Thy word to me
is, “Be it far from Thee, this shall not be unto Thee:” but
my word to thee is, “Not only is it hurtful to thee, and
destructive, to hinder me and to be displeased at my Passion, but it
will be impossible for thee even to be saved, unless thou thyself too

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p7">Thus, lest they should think His suffering unworthy of
Him, not by the former things only, but also by the events that were
coming on, He teaches them the gain thereof. Thus in John first, He

doth He bring forward the statement that it is meet to die, but
concerning them also. “For so great is the profit thereof, that

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p9">This however He makes clear by what follows, but for the
present He works it out on one side only. And see how He also makes His
discourse unexceptionable: not saying at all, “whether you will,
or no, you must suffer this,” but how? “If any man will
come after me.” “I force not, I compel not, but each one I
make lord of his own choice; wherefore also I say, ‘If any man
will.’ For to good things do I call you, not to things evil, or
burdensome; not to punishment and vengeance, that I should have to
compel. Nay, the nature of the thing is alone sufficient to attract
you.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p10">Now, thus saying, He drew them unto Him the more. For he
indeed that uses compulsion oftens turns men away, but he that leaves
the hearer to choose attracts him more. For soothing is a mightier
thing than force. Wherefore even He Himself said, “If any man
will.” “For great,” saith He, “are the good
things which I give you, and such as for men even to run to them of
their own accord. For neither if one were giving gold, and offering a
treasure, would he invite with force. And if that invitation be without
compulsion, much more this, to the good things in the Heavens. Since if
the nature of the thing persuade thee not to run, thou art not worthy
to receive it at all, nor if thou shouldest receive it, wilt thou well
know what thou hast received.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p11">Wherefore Christ compels not, but urges, sparing us. For
since they seemed to be murmuring much, being secretly disturbed at the
saying, He saith, “No need of disturbance or of trouble. If ye do
not account what I have mentioned to be a cause of innumerable
blessings, even when befalling yourselves, I use no force, nor do I
compel, but if any be willing to follow, him I call.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p12">“For do not by any means imagine that this is your
following of me; I mean, what ye now do attending upon me. Ye have need
of many toils, many dangers, if ye are to come after me. For thou
oughtest not, O Peter, because thou hast confessed me Son of God,
therefore only to expect crowns, and to suppose this enough for thy
salvation, and for the future to enjoy security, as having done all.
For although it be in my power, as Son of God, to hinder thee from
having any trial at all of those hardships; yet such is not my will,
for thy sake, that thou mayest thyself too contribute something, and be
more approved.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p13">For so, if one were a judge at the games, and had a
friend in the lists, he would not wish to crown him by favor only, but
also for his own toils; and for this reason especially, because he
loves him. Even so Christ also; whom He most loves, those He most of
all will have to approve themselves by their own means also, and not
from His help alone.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p14">But see how at the same time He makes His saying not a
grievous one. For He doth by no means compass them only with His
terror, but He also puts forth the doctrine generally to the world,
saying, “If any one will,” be it woman or man, ruler or
subject, let him come this way.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p15">2. And though he seem to have spoken but one single
thing, yet His sayings are three, “Let him renounce
himself,” and “Let him bear his cross,” and
“Let him follow me;” and two of them are joined together,
but the one is put by itself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p16">But let us see first what it can be to deny one’s
self. Let us learn first what it is to deny another, and then we shall
know what it may be to deny one’s self. What then is it to deny
another? He that is denying another,—for example, either brother,
or servant, or whom you will,—should he see him either beaten, or
bound, or led to execution, or whatever he may suffer, stands not by
him, doth not help him, is not moved, feels nothing for him, as being
once for all alienated from him. Thus then He will have us disregard
our own body, so that whether men scourge, or banish, or burn, or
whatever they do, we may not spare it. For this is to spare it. Since
fathers too then spare their offspring, when committing them to
teachers, they command not to spare them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p17">So also Christ; He said not, “Let him not spare
himself,” but very strictly, “Let him renounce
himself;” that is, let him have nothing to do with himself, but
give himself up to all dangers and conflicts; and let him so feel, as
though another were suffering it all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p18">And He said not, “Let him deny,”<note n="2134" id="iii.LIII-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p19"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIII-p19.1">ἀρνησσθω</span>.</p></note>but “Let him renounce;”<note n="2135" id="iii.LIII-p19.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p20"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIII-p20.1">ἀπαρνησσθω</span>.
[Comp. note, p. 338.]</p></note>even by this small addition intimating again, how very far it goes. For
this latter is more than the former.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p21">“And let him take up his cross.” This arises
out of the other. For to hinder thy supposing that words, and insults,
and reproaches are to be the limits of our self-renunciation, He saith
also how far one ought to renounce one’s self; that is, unto
death, and that a reproachful death. Therefore He said not, “Let
him renounce himself unto death,” but, “Let him take up his
cross;” setting forth the reproachful death; and that not once,
nor twice, but throughout all life one ought so to do.
“Yea,” saith He, “bear about this death continually,
and day by day

<pb n="326" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_326.html" id="iii.LIII-Page_326" />

be ready for
slaughter. For since many have indeed contemned riches, and pleasure,
and glory, but death they despised not, but feared dangers; I,”
saith He, “will that my champion should wrestle even unto blood,
and that the limits of his course should reach unto slaughter; so that
although one must undergo death, death with reproach, the accursed
death, and that upon evil surmise, we are to bear all things nobly, and
rather to rejoice in being suspected.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p22">“And let him follow me.” That is, it being
possible for one to suffer, yet not to follow Him, when one doth not
suffer for Him (for so robbers often suffer grievously, and violaters
of tombs, and sorcerers); to hinder thy supposing that the mere nature
of thy calamities is sufficient, He adds the occasion of these
calamities.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p23">And what is it? In order that, so doing and suffering,
thou mayest follow Him; that for Him thou mayest undergo all things;
that thou mayest possess the other virtues also. For this too is
expressed by “Let him follow me;” so as to show forth not
fortitude only, such as is exercised in our calamities, but temperance
also, and moderation, and all self-restraint. This being properly
“to follow,” the giving heed also to the other virtues, and
for His sake suffering all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p24">For there are who follow the devil even to the endurance
of all this, and for his sake give up their own lives; but we for
Christ, or rather for our own sakes: they indeed to harm themselves
both here and there; but we, that we may gain both lives.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p25">How then is it not extreme dullness, not to show forth
even the same fortitude with them that perish; and this, when we are to
reap from it so many crowns? Yet with us surely Christ Himself is
present to be our help, but with them no one.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p26">Now He had indeed already spoken this very injunction,
when He sent them, saying, “Go not into the way of the
Gentiles” (for, saith He, “I send you as sheep in the midst
of wolves,” and, “ye shall be brought before kings and
governors”)<note n="2136" id="iii.LIII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 5, 16, 18" id="iii.LIII-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|10|5|0|0;|Matt|10|16|0|0;|Matt|10|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.5 Bible:Matt.10.16 Bible:Matt.10.18">Matt. x. 5,
16, 18</scripRef>.</p></note>but now with more intensity and severity. For then He spake of death
only, but here He hath mentioned a cross also, and a continual cross.
For “let him take up,” saith He, “his cross;”
that is, “let him carry it continually and bear it.” And
this He is wont to do in everything; not in the first instance, nor
from the beginning, but quietly and gradually, bringing in the greater
commandments, that the hearers may not count it strange.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p28">3. Then, because the saying seemed to be vehement, see
how He softens it by what follows, and sets down rewards surpassing our
toils; and not rewards only, but also the penalties of vice: nay, on
these last He dwells more than on those, since not so much His
bestowing blessings, as His threat of severities, is wont to bring
ordinary men to their senses. See at least how He both begins here from
this, and ends in this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p29">“For whosoever will save his life shall lose
it,” saith He, “but whosoever shall lose his life for my
sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited,<note n="2137" id="iii.LIII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p30">[R.V., “shall a man be profited;” so the

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p32">Now what He saith is like this: “not as unsparing
towards you, but rather as exceedingly sparing you, I enjoin these
things. For he who spares his child, ruins it; but he who spares it
not, preserves.” To which effect also a certain wise man said,
“If thou beat thy son with a rod, he shall not die, but thou
shalt deliver his soul from death.”<note n="2139" id="iii.LIII-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p33"><scripRef passage="Prov. xxiii. 13, 14" id="iii.LIII-p33.1" parsed="|Prov|23|13|23|14" osisRef="Bible:Prov.23.13-Prov.23.14">Prov.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p35">This takes place in the camp also. For if the general,
sparing the soldiers, commands them to remain within the place always,
he will destroy with them the inhabitants too.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p36">“In order then that this may not happen in your
case also,” saith He, “ye must be arrayed against continual
death. For now too a grievous war is about to be kindled. Sit not
therefore within, but go forth and fight; and shouldest thou fall in
thy post, then hast thou obtained life.” For if in the visible
wars he that in his post meets slaughter, is both more distinguished
than the rest, and more invincible, and more formidable to the enemy;
although we know that after death the king, in behalf of whom he takes
his station, is not able to raise him up again: much more in these
wars, when there are such hopes of resurrection besides, will he who
exposes his own life unto death, find it; in one sense, because he will
not be quickly taken; in a second, because even though he fall,

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p38">4. Then, because he had said, “He who will save
shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose shall save it,” and on
that side had set salvation and destruction, and on this salva

tion and destruction; to prevent any
one’s imagining the one destruction and salvation to be all the
same with the other, and to teach thee plainly that the difference
between this salvation and that is as great as between destruction and
salvation; from the contraries also He makes an inference once for all
to establish these points. “For what is a man
profited,”<note n="2142" id="iii.LIII-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p39">[Here the citation agrees with the rec.
text.—R.]</p></note>saith He, “if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul
?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p40">Seest thou how the wrongful preservation of it is
destruction, and worse than all destruction, as being even past remedy,
from the want of anything more to redeem it? For “tell me not
this,” saith He, “that he that hath escaped such dangers
hath saved his life; but together with his life put also the whole
world, yet what profit hath he thereby, if the soul perish?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p41">For tell me, shouldest thou see thy servants in luxury,
and thyself in extreme calamity, wilt thou indeed profit aught by being
master? By no means. Make this reckoning then with regard to thy soul
also, when the flesh is in luxury and wealth, and she awaiting the
destruction to come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p42">“What shall a man give in exchange for his soul
?”<note n="2143" id="iii.LIII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p43">[Here <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIII-p43.1">ὑπρ</span> does not occur, the text agreeing with the
received.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p44">Again, He dwells upon the same point. What? hast thou
another soul to give for this soul? saith He. Why, shouldest thou lose
money, thou wilt be able to give money; or be it house, or slaves, or
any other kind of possession, but for thy soul, if thou lose it, thou
wilt have no other soul to give: yea, though thou hadst the world,
though thou wast king of the whole earth, thou wouldest not be able, by
paying down all earthly goods, with the earth itself, to redeem but one
soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p45">And what marvel, if it be so with the soul? Since even
in the body one may see that so it turns out. Though thou wear ten
thousand diadems, but have a body sickly by nature, and incurable, thou
wilt not be able, not by giving all thy kingdom, to recover this body,
not though thou add innumerable persons, and cities, and goods.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p46">Now thus I bid thee reason with regard to thy soul also;
or rather even much more with regard to the soul; and do thou,
forsaking all besides, spend all thy care upon it. Do not then while
taking thought about the things of others, neglect thyself and thine
own things; which now all men do, resembling them that work in the
mines. For neither do these receive any profit from this labor, nor
from the wealth; but rather great harm, both because they incur
fruitless peril, and incur it for other men, reaping no benefit from
such their toils and deaths. These even now are objects of imitation to
many, who are digging up wealth for others; or rather we are more
wretched even than this, inasmuch as hell itself awaits us after these
our labors. For they indeed are staid from those toils by death, but to
us death proves a beginning of innumerable evils.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p47">But if thou say, thou hast in thy wealth the fruit of
thy toils: show me thy soul gladdened, and then I am persuaded. For of
all things in us the soul is chief. And if the body be fattened, while
she is pining away, this prosperity is nothing to thee (even as when
the handmaiden is glad, the happiness of the maidservant is nothing to
her mistress perishing, nor is the fair robe anything compared with the
weak flesh); but Christ will say unto thee again, “What shall a
man give in exchange for his soul ?” on every hand commanding
thee to be busied about that, and to take account of it only.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p48">5. Having alarmed them therefore hereby, He comforts
them also by His good things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p49">“For the Son of Man shall come,” saith He,
“in the glory of His Father with His holy angels, and then He
shall reward every man according to his works.”<note n="2144" id="iii.LIII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p50"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 37" id="iii.LIII-p50.1" parsed="|Matt|16|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.37">Matt. xvi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p51">Seest thou how the glory of the Father and of the Son is
all one? But if the glory be one, it is quite evident that the
substance also is one. For if in one substance there be a difference of
glory (“for there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of
the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from
another star in glory;”<note n="2145" id="iii.LIII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p52"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xv. 41" id="iii.LIII-p52.1" parsed="|1Cor|15|41|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.41">1 Cor. xv.

whereof the glory is one? For He said not at all, “In glory such
as the Father’s,” whereby thou mightest suppose again some
variation; but implying entire perfection, “In that same
glory,” saith He, “will He come;” for it to be deemed
one and the same.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p53">“Now, why fear, O Peter” (so He speaks),
“on being told of death? Why, then shalt thou see me in the glory
of the Father. And if I am in glory, so are ye; your interests are no
wise limited to the present life, but another sort of portion will take
you up, a better one.” Nevertheless, when He had spoken of the
good things, He stayed not at this, but mingled the fearful things
also, bringing forward that judgment-seat, and the inexorable account,
and the inflexible sentence, and the judgment that cannot be
deceived.</p>

<pb n="328" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_328.html" id="iii.LIII-Page_328" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p54">He suffered not however His discourse to appear only
dismal, but tempered it also with good hopes. For neither did He say,
“then shall He punish them that sinned,” but, “He
shall reward every man according to his doings.”<note n="2146" id="iii.LIII-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p55">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIII-p55.1">τν
πρξιν</span>, the reading accepted in
R.V.—R.]</p></note> And this He said, reminding not only the sinners of punishment, but
also them that have done well of prizes and crowns.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p56">6. And He indeed spake it, in part to refresh the good,
but I ever shudder at hearing it, for I am not of them that are
crowned, and I suppose that others also share with us in our fear and
anxiety. For whom is this saying not enough to startle, when he hath
entered into his own conscience; and to make him shudder, and convince
him that we have need of sackcloth, and of prolonged fasting, more than
the people of the Ninevites? For not for an overthrow of a city, and
the common end, are we concerned, but for eternal punishment, and the
fire that is never quenched.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p57">Wherefore also I praise and admire the monks that have
occupied the desert places, as for the rest, so for this saying. For
they after having made their dinners, or rather after supper (for
dinner they know not at any time, because they know that the present
time is one of mourning and fasting); after supper then, in saying
certain hymns of thanksgiving unto God, they make mention of this
expression also. And if ye would hear the very hymns themselves, that
ye too may say them continually, I will rehearse to you the whole of
that sacred song. The words of it then stand as follows: “Blessed
God, who feedest me from my youth up, who givest food to all flesh;
fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that always having all
sufficiency we may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our
Lord; with whom be unto Thee glory, honor and might, with the Holy
Spirit, forever. Amen. Glory to Thee, O Lord, glory to Thee, O Holy
One, glory to Thee, O King, that Thou hast given us meat to make us
glad. Fill us with the Holy Ghost, that we may be found well-pleasing
before Thee, not being ashamed, when Thou renderest to every man
according to his works.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p58">Now this hymn is in all parts worthy of admiration, but
especially the above ending of it. That is, because meals and food are
wont to dissipate and weigh down, they put this saying as a kind of
bridle upon the soul, at the time of indulgence reminding it of the
time of judgment. For they have learnt what befell Israel through a
costly table. “For my beloved,” saith He, “ate, and
waxed fat, and kicked.”<note n="2147" id="iii.LIII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p59"><scripRef passage="Deut. xxxii. 15" id="iii.LIII-p59.1" parsed="|Deut|32|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.32.15">Deut.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p61">For after that feast, then they ventured on those acts
of lawless daring.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p62">Do thou therefore also look to it, lest something like
it befall thee. For though thou sacrifice not to stone nor to gold,
either sheep or bullocks, see lest to wrath thou sacrifice thine own
soul, lest to whoredom or other like passions, thou sacrifice thine own
salvation. Yea—on this account, you see, they being afraid of
these downfalls, when they have enjoyed their meal, or rather fasting
(for their meal is in fact fasting), remind themselves of the terrible
judgment-seat, and of that day. And if they who correct themselves both
with fasting, and with nights spent on the ground, with watchings, and
with sackcloth, and with ten thousand means, do yet require also this
reminding, when will it be possible for us to live virtuously; who set
forth tables loaded with innumerable wrecks, and do not so much as pray
at all, neither in the beginning nor the end ?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p63">7. Wherefore to put an end to these shipwrecks, let us
bring before us that hymn and unfold it all, that seeing the profit
thereof, we too may chant it constantly over our table, and quell the
rude motions of the belly, introducing both the manners and laws of
those angels into our houses. For you ought indeed to go there and reap
these fruits; but since ye are not willing, at least through our words,
hear this spiritual melody, and let every one after his meal say these
words, beginning thus.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p64">“Blessed God.” For the apostolic law they
straightway fulfill, that commands, “Whatsoever we do in word or
in deed, that we do it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving
thanks to God and the Father by Him.”<note n="2149" id="iii.LIII-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p65"><scripRef passage="Colos. iii. 17" id="iii.LIII-p65.1" parsed="|Col|3|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.3.17">Colos. iii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p66">Next, the thanksgiving takes place not for that one day
only, but for all their life. For, “Who feedest me,” it is
said, “from my youth up.” And a lesson of self-command is
drawn thence, that when God feeds, we must not take thought. For if
upon a king’s promising thee to furnish thy daily food out of his
own stores, thou wouldest be of good hope for the future; much more,
when God gives, and all things pour upon thee as out of fountains,
shouldest thou be freed from all anxiety. Yea, and to this very intent
they so speak, that they may persuade

<pb n="329" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_329.html" id="iii.LIII-Page_329" />

both themselves, and those that are made
disciples by them, to put off all worldly care.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p67">Then, not to have thee suppose that for themselves only
they offer up this thanksgiving, they further say, “Who givest
food to all flesh,” giving thanks in behalf of all the world; and
as fathers of the whole earth, so do they offer up their praises for
all, and train themselves to a sincere brotherly love. For it is not
even possible they should hate them, in behalf of whom they thank God,
that they are fed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p68">Seest thou both charity introduced by their
thanksgiving, and worldly care cast out, both by the preceding words,
and by these? For if He feed all flesh, much more them that are devoted
to him; if them that are entangled in worldly cares, much more them
that are freed from the same.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p69">To establish this, Christ Himself said, “How many
sparrows do ye exceed in value?”<note n="2150" id="iii.LIII-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p70"><scripRef passage="Luke xii. 7" id="iii.LIII-p70.1" parsed="|Luke|12|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.7">Luke xii.
7</scripRef>. [Very freely cited.]</p></note> And He said it, teaching them not to put their confidence in wealth and
land and seeds; for it is not these that feed us, but the word of God.<note n="2151" id="iii.LIII-p70.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p71"><scripRef passage="Deut. viii. 3; Matt. iv. 4" id="iii.LIII-p71.1" parsed="|Deut|8|3|0|0;|Matt|4|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.8.3 Bible:Matt.4.4">Deut. viii.
3; Matt. iv. 4</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p72">Hereby they stop the mouths, both of the
Manichæans, and of them of Valentinus, and of all that are
diseased in their way. For sure this Being is not evil, who sets his
own stores before all, even before them that blaspheme Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p73">Then comes the petition: “Fill our hearts with joy
and gladness.” With what manner of joy then, doth it mean? the
joy of this world? God forbid: for had they meant this, they would not
have occupied summits of mountains, and deserts, nor wrapt themselves
in sackcloth; but that joy they mean, which hath nothing in common with
this present life, the joy of angels, the joy above.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p74">And they do not simply ask for it, but in great excess;
for they say not, “give,” but, “fill,” and they
say not “us,” but “our hearts.” For this is
especially a heart’s joy; “For the fruit of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace.”<note n="2152" id="iii.LIII-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p75"><scripRef passage="Gal. v. 22" id="iii.LIII-p75.1" parsed="|Gal|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.5.22">Gal. v.
22</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p76">Thus, because sin brought in sorrow, they request that
through joy righteousness may be implanted in them, for no otherwise
might joy be engendered.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p77">“That, always having all sufficiency, we may
abound unto every good work.”<note n="2153" id="iii.LIII-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p78"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 8" id="iii.LIII-p78.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.8">2 Cor. ix.
8</scripRef>.</p></note> See how they fulfill that word of the gospel which saith, “Give
us this day our daily bread,” and how they seek even this for
spiritual ends. For their phrase is, “That we may abound unto
every good work.” They said not, “That we may do our duty
only,” but “even more than what is enjoined,” for,
“that we may abound,” means this. And while of God they
seek sufficiency in things needful, themselves are willing to obey not
in sufficiency only, but with much abundance, and in all things. This
is the part of well-disposed servants, this of men strict in goodness,
to abound always, and in all things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p79">Then again reminding themselves of their own weakness,
and that without the influence from above nothing noble can be done;
having said, “that we may abound unto every good work,”
they add, “in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom unto Thee be
glory, honor, and might forever. Amen;” framing this end like
their commencement by a thread of thanksgiving.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p80">8. After this again, they seem to begin afresh, but they
are keeping to the same argument. As Paul also in the beginning of an
epistle, having closed with a doxology, where he says, “According
to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory forever.
Amen;”<note n="2154" id="iii.LIII-p80.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p81"><scripRef passage="Gal. i. 4, 5" id="iii.LIII-p81.1" parsed="|Gal|1|4|1|5" osisRef="Bible:Gal.1.4-Gal.1.5">Gal. i. 4,
5</scripRef>.</p></note>begins the subject again on which he was writing. And again in another
place when he had said, “They worshipped and served the creature
more than the Creator, who is blessed forever: Amen;”<note n="2155" id="iii.LIII-p81.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p82"><scripRef passage="Rom. i. 25" id="iii.LIII-p82.1" parsed="|Rom|1|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.1.25">Rom. i.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>he completed not his discourse, but begins again.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p83">Therefore neither let us blame these our angels, as
acting disorderly, for that having closed with a doxology they begin
again the sacred hymns. For they follow apostolical laws, beginning
from a doxology, and ending therein, and after that end making a
commencement again.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p84">Wherefore they say, “Glory be to Thee, O Lord;
glory be to Thee, O Holy One; glory be to Thee, O King; that Thou hast
given us food to make us glad.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p85">Since not for the greater things only, but also for the
lesser, we ought to give thanks. And they do give thanks for these
also, putting to shame the heresy of the Manichæans, and of as
many as affirm our present life to be evil. For lest for their high
self-command, and contempt of the belly, thou shouldest suspect them as
abhorring the meat, like the heretics aforesaid, who choke
themselves<note n="2156" id="iii.LIII-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p86"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIII-p86.1">ἀπαγχονιζντων</span>,
a strong figurative expression, as it seems, for the unhallowed
self-tormenting of the Manichæans. In Hom. XLII., the word is
applied to Saul, “choking with envy” towards David.</p></note>to death; they by their prayer teach thee, that not from abhorrence of
God’s creatures they abstain from most of them, but as exercising
self-restraint.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p87">And see how after thanksgiving for His past gifts, they
are importunate also for the greater things, and dwell not upon the
mat

<pb n="330" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_330.html" id="iii.LIII-Page_330" />

ters of this life, but mount
above the heavens, and say, “Fill us with the Holy Ghost.”
For it is not even possible to approve one’s self as one ought,
not being filled with that grace; as there is no doing anything noble
or great, without the benefit of Christ’s influences.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p88">As therefore when they had said, “That we may
abound unto every good work,” they added, “In Christ
Jesus;” so here also they say, “Fill us with the Holy
Ghost, that we may be found to have been well-pleasing before
Thee.”<note n="2157" id="iii.LIII-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p89">[In some <span class="c20" id="iii.LIII-p89.1">mss</span>. the two
paragraphs which follow are omitted, “and not be ashamed”
being joined with this clause.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p90">Seest thou how for the things of this life they pray
not, but give thanks only; but for the things of the Spirit, they both
give thanks and pray. For, “seek ye,” saith He, “the
kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto
you.”<note n="2158" id="iii.LIII-p90.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p91"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 33" id="iii.LIII-p91.1" parsed="|Matt|6|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.33">Matt. vi.
33</scripRef>. [Here, also, the peculiar
reading “Kingdom of Heaven” occurs. Comp. Homily XXII.
4.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p92">And mark too another kind of severe goodness in them;
their saying, namely, “That we may be found to have been
well-pleasing in Thy sight, not being ashamed.” For “we
care not,” say they, “for the shame that proceeds from the
many, but whatever men may say of us, laughing, upbraiding, we do not
so much as regard it; but our whole endeavor is not to be put to shame
then.” But in these expressions, they bring in also the river of
fire, and the prizes, and the rewards.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p93">They said not, “that we be not punished,”
but, “that we be not ashamed.”<note n="2159" id="iii.LIII-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p94">[See above, note 1.—R.]</p></note> For this is to us far more fearful than hell, to seem to have offended
our Lord.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p95">But since the more part and the grosser sort are not in
fear of this, they add, “When Thou renderest to every man
according to his works.” Seest thou how greatly these strangers
and pilgrims have benefitted us, these citizens of the wilderness, or
rather citizens of the Heavens? For whereas we are strangers to the
Heavens, but citizens of the earth, these are just the contrary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p96">And after this hymn, being filled with much compunction,
and with many and fervent tears, so they proceed to sleep, snatching
just so much of it as a little to refresh themselves. And again, the
nights they make days, spending them in thanksgivings and in the
singing of psalms.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p97">But not men only, but women also practise this
self-denial, overcoming the weakness of their nature by the abundance
of their zeal.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p98">Let us be abashed then at their earnestness, we who are
men, let us cease to be fastened to the things present, to shadow, to
dreams, to smoke. For the more part of our life is passed in
insensibility.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p99">For both the first period of our life is full of much
folly, and that again which travels on to old age, makes all the
feeling that is in us wither away, and small is the space between, that
is able feelingly to enjoy pleasure; or rather, not even that hath a
pure participation thereof, by reason of innumerable cares and toils,
that harrass it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p100">Wherefore, I pray, let us seek the unmovable and eternal
goods, and the life that never has old age.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p101">For even one dwelling in a city may imitate the
self-denial of the monks; yea, one who has a wife, and is busied in a
household, may pray, and fast, and learn compunction. Since they also,
who at the first were instructed by the apostles, though they dwelt in
cities, yet showed forth the piety of the occupiers of the deserts: and
others again who had to rule over workshops, as Priscilla and
Aquila.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p102">And the prophets too, all had both wives and households,
as Isaiah, as Ezekiel, as the great Moses, and received no hurt
therefrom in regard of virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIII-p103">These then let us also imitate, and continually offer
thanksgiving to God, continually sing hymns to Him; let us give heed to
temperance, and to all other virtues, and the self-denial that is
practised in the deserts, let us bring into our cities; that we may
appear both well-pleasing before God, and approved before men, and
attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man
of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom be unto the
Father, glory, honor, and might, together with the holy and life-giving
Spirit, now and always and world without end. Amen.<note n="2160" id="iii.LIII-p103.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIII-p104">The grace here commented on is in its commencement
the same with one still used <i>before meat</i> in collegiate bodies:
<i>e.g.</i> in Oriel College, Oxford. “<i>Benedicte Deus qui
pascis nos in juventute nostra, et præbes cibum omni carni: reple
gaudio et lætitia corda nostra, ut nos affatim quod satis est
habentes, abundemus ad omne opus bonum: Per Jesum Christum Dominum
nostrum</i>: Amen.” The conclusion of St. Chrysostom’s
grace seems to be referred to by St. Just Mart. Apol. 1. p. 83 C. and
p. 50 E. as quoted by Mr. Field here.</p></note>

<p class="c48" id="iii.LIV-p3">“Verily, verily, I say unto you, There are some of
them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, until they see
the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.LIV-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.LIV-p4.1">Thus</span>, inasmuch as He had
discoursed much of dangers and death, and of His own passion, and of
the slaughter of the disciples, and had laid on them those severe
injunctions; and these were in the present life and at hand, but the
good things in hope and expectation:—for example, “They
save their life who lose it;” “He is coming in the glory of
His Father;” “He renders His rewards:”—He
willing to assure their very sight, and to show what kind of glory that
is wherewith He is to come, so far as it was possible for them to learn
it; even in their present life He shows and reveals this; that they
should not grieve any more, either over their own death, or over that
of their Lord, and especially Peter in His sorrow.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p5">And see what He doth. Having discoursed of hell,<note n="2161" id="iii.LIV-p5.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p6">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIV-p6.1">γεννη</span>.]</p></note>and of the kingdom (for as well by saying, “He that findeth his
life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose it for my sake, shall find
it;”<note n="2162" id="iii.LIV-p6.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p7"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 25" id="iii.LIV-p7.1" parsed="|Matt|16|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.25">Matt. xvi.

ατο</span></span>.]</p></note> He had manifested both of these): having, I say, spoken of both, the
kingdom indeed He shows in the vision, but hell not yet.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p9">Why so? Because had they been another kind of people, of
a grosser sort, this too would have been necessary; but since they are
approved and considerate, He leads them on the gentler way. But not
therefore only doth He make this disclosure, but because to Himself
also it was far more suitable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p10">Not however that He passes over this subject either, but
in some places He almost brings even before our eyes the very realities
of hell; as when He introduces the picture of Lazarus, and mentions him
that exacted the hundred pence, and him that was clad in the filthy
garments, and others not a few.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p11">2. “And after six days He taketh with Him Peter
and James and John.”<note n="2164" id="iii.LIV-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p12"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 1" id="iii.LIV-p12.1" parsed="|Matt|17|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.1">Matt. xvii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p13">Now another says, “after eight,”<note n="2165" id="iii.LIV-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p14"><scripRef passage="Luke ix. 28" id="iii.LIV-p14.1" parsed="|Luke|9|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.9.28">Luke ix.
28</scripRef>.</p></note>not contradicting this writer, but most fully agreeing with him. For
the one expressed both the very day on which He spake, and that on
which He led them up; but the other, the days between them only.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p15">But mark thou, I pray thee, the severe goodness of
Matthew, not concealing those who were preferred to himself. This John
also often doth, recording the peculiar praises of Peter with great
sincerity. For the choir of these holy men was everywhere pure from
envy and vainglory.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p16">Having taken therefore the leaders, “He bringeth
them up into a high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them:
and His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was<note n="2166" id="iii.LIV-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p17">[R.V. “his garments became,” etc.]</p></note>white as the light. And there appeared unto them Moses and Elias
talking with Him.”<note n="2167" id="iii.LIV-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 2, 3" id="iii.LIV-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|17|2|17|3" osisRef="Bible:Matt.17.2-Matt.17.3">Matt. xvii.
2, 3</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p19">Wherefore doth He take with Him these only? Because
these were superior to the rest. And Peter indeed showed his
superiority by exceedingly loving Him; but John by being exceedingly
loved of Him; and James again by his answer which he answered with his
brother, saying, “We are able to drink the cup;”<note n="2168" id="iii.LIV-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 20, 22" id="iii.LIV-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|20|20|0|0;|Matt|20|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.20 Bible:Matt.20.22">Matt. xx.
20, 22</scripRef>.</p></note>nor yet by his answer only, but also by his works; both by the rest of
them, and by fulfilling, what he said. For so earnest was he, and
grievous to the Jews, that Herod himself supposed that he had bestowed
herein a very great favor on the Jews, I mean in slaying him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p21">But wherefore doth He not lead them up straightway? To
spare the other disciples any feeling of human weakness: for which
cause He omits also the names of them that are to go up. And this,
because the rest would have desired exceedingly to have followed, being
to see a pattern of that glory; and would have been pained, as
overlooked. For though it was somewhat in a corporeal way that He made
the disclosure, yet nevertheless the thing had much in it to be
desired.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p22">Wherefore then doth He at all foretell it? That they
might be readier to seize the high meaning, by His foretelling it; and
being filled with the more vehement desire in that round of days, might
so be present with their mind quite awake and full of care.</p>

<pb n="332" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_332.html" id="iii.LIV-Page_332" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p23">3. But wherefore doth He also bring forward Moses and
Elias? One might mention many reasons. And first of all this: because
the multitudes said He was, some Elias, some Jeremias, some one of the
old prophets, He brings the leaders of His choir, that they might see
the difference even hereby between the servants and the Lord; and that
Peter was rightly commended for confessing Him Son of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p24">But besides that, one may mention another reason also:
that because men were continually accusing Him of transgressing the
law, and accounting Him to be a blasphemer, as appropriating to Himself
a glory which belonged not to Him, even the Father’s, and were
saying, “This Man is not of God, because He keepeth not the
Sabbath day;”<note n="2169" id="iii.LIV-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p25"><scripRef passage="John ix. 16" id="iii.LIV-p25.1" parsed="|John|9|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.9.16">John ix.
16</scripRef>.</p></note>and again, “For a good work we stone Thee not, but for blasphemy,
and because that Thou, being a man, makest Thyself God:”<note n="2170" id="iii.LIV-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p26"><scripRef passage="John x. 33" id="iii.LIV-p26.1" parsed="|John|10|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.10.33">John x.
33</scripRef>.</p></note>that both the charges might be shown to spring from envy, and He be
proved not liable to either; and that neither is His conduct a
transgression of the law, nor His calling Himself equal to the Father
an appropriation of glory not His own; He brings forward them who had
shone out in each of these respects: Moses, because he gave the law,
and the Jews might infer that he would not have overlooked its being
trampled on, as they supposed, nor have shown respect to the
transgressor of it, and the enemy of its founder: Elias too for his
part was jealous for the glory of God, and were any man an adversary of
God, and calling himself God, making himself equal to the Father, while
he was not what he said, and had no right to do so; he was not the
person to stand by, and hearken unto him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p27">And one may mention another reason also, with those
which have been spoken of. Of what kind then is it? To inform them that
He hath power both of death and life, is ruler both above and beneath.
For this cause He brings forward both him that had died, and him that
never yet suffered this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p28">But the fifth motive, (for it is a fifth, besides those
that have been mentioned), even the evangelist himself hath revealed.
Now what was this? To show the glory of the cross, and to console Peter
and the others in their dread of the passion, and to raise up their
minds. Since having come, they by no means held their peace, but
“spake,” it is said, “of the glory<note n="2171" id="iii.LIV-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p29"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIV-p29.1">δξαν</span>: in
our copies of St. Luke <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIV-p29.2">ἔξοδον<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIV-p29.3">,</span></span> but St. Chrysostom’s reading is that of
a good many <span class="c20" id="iii.LIV-p29.4">mss</span>. [None of the recent critical
editions of the New Testament refer to any Greek <span class="c20" id="iii.LIV-p29.5">mss</span>., uncial or cursive, with this reading. Chrysostom
alludes to it again in Homily LVIII. 1.—R.]</p></note>which He was to accomplish at Jerusalem;<note n="2172" id="iii.LIV-p29.6"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p30"><scripRef passage="Luke ix. 31" id="iii.LIV-p30.1" parsed="|Luke|9|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.9.31">Luke ix.
31</scripRef>.</p></note>” that is, of the passion, and the cross; for so they call it
always.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p31">And not thus only did He cheer them, but also by the
excellency itself of the men, being such as He was especially requiring
from themselves. I mean, that having said, “If any man will come
after me, let him take up his cross, and follow me;” them that
had died ten thousand times for God’s decrees, and the people
entrusted to them, these persons He sets before them. Because each of
these, having lost his life, found it. For each of them both spake
boldly unto tyrants, the one to the Egyptian, the other to Ahab; and in
behalf of heartless and disobedient men; and by the very persons who
were saved by them, they were brought into extreme danger; and each of
them wishing to withdraw men from idolatry; and each being unlearned;
for the one was of a “slow tongue,”<note n="2173" id="iii.LIV-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p32"><scripRef passage="Exod. iv. 10" id="iii.LIV-p32.1" parsed="|Exod|4|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.4.10">Exod. iv.

rudest in his bearing: and of voluntary poverty both were very strict
observers; for neither had Moses made any gain, nor had Elias aught
more than his sheepskin; and this under the old law, and when they had
not received so great a gift of miracles. For what if Moses clave a
sea? yet Peter walked on the water, and was able to remove mountains,
and used to work cures of all manner of bodily diseases, and to drive
away savage demons, and by the shadow of his body to work those
wonderful and great prodigies; and changed the whole world. And if
Elias too raised a dead man, yet these raised ten thousand; and this
before the spirit was as yet vouchsafed to them. He brings them forward
accordingly for this cause also. For He would have them emulate their
winning ways toward the people, and their presence of mind and
inflexibility; and that they should be meek like Moses, and jealous for
God like Elias, and full of tender care, as they were. For the one
endured a famine of three years for the Jewish people; and the other
said, “If thou wilt forgive them their sin, forgive; else blot me
too out of the book, which thou hast written.”<note n="2174" id="iii.LIV-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p33"><scripRef passage="Exod. xxxii. 32" id="iii.LIV-p33.1" parsed="|Exod|32|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.32.32">Exod.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p34">For He brought those in glory too, not that these should
stay where they were, but that they might even surpass their limitary
lines. For example, when they said, “Should we command fire to

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p36">And let none suppose us to condemn Elias as imperfect;
we say not this; for indeed he was exceedingly perfect, but in his own
times, when the mind of men was in some degree childish, and they
needed this kind of schooling. Since Moses too was in this respect
perfect; nevertheless these have more required of them than he. For
“except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the

disposed than the Egyptians; neither were they to speak with Pharaoh,
but to fight hand to hand with the devil, the very prince of
wickedness. Yea, and their appointed struggle was, both to bind him,
and to spoil all his goods; and this they did cleaving not the sea, but
an abyss of ungodliness, through the rod of Jesse,—an abyss
having waves far more grievous. See at any rate how many things there
were to put the men in fear; death, poverty, dishonor, their
innumerable sufferings; and at these things they trembled more than the
Jews of old at that sea. But nevertheless against all these things He
persuaded them boldly to venture, and to pass as along dry ground with
all security.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p38">To train them therefore for all this, He brought forward
those who shone forth under the old law.</p>

That is, when he saw a mountain, and so great retirement and solitude,
his thought was, “He hath great security here, even from the
place; and not only from the place, but also from His going away no
more unto Jerusalem.” For he would have Him be there continually:
wherefore also he speaks of “tabernacles.” For “if
this may be,” saith he, “we shall not go up to Jerusalem;
and if we go not up, He will not die, for there He said the scribes
would set upon Him.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p42">But thus indeed he durst not speak; but desiring however
to order things so, he said undoubtingly, “It is good for us to
be here,” where Moses also is present, and Elias; Elias who
brought down fire on the mountain, and Moses who entered into the thick
darkness, and talked with God; and no one will even know where we
are.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p43">Seest thou the ardent lover of Christ? For look not now
at this, that the manner of his exhortation was not well weighed, but

alarm; not this only, which I have mentioned, but another also, arising
from that sight. In fact, the other evangelists, to declare this, and

it is a bright cloud.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p66">And whereas Peter had said “Let us make three
tabernacles,” He showed a tabernacle not made with hands.
Wherefore in that case it was smoke, and vapor of a furnace; but in
this, light unspeakable and a voice.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p67">Then, to signify that not merely concerning some one of
the three was it spoken, but concerning Christ only; when the voice was
uttered, they were taken away. For by no means, had it been spoken
merely concerning any one of them, would this man have remained alone,
the two being severed from Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p68">Why then did not the cloud likewise receive Christ
alone, but all of them together? If it had received Christ alone, He
would have been thought to have Himself uttered the voice. Wherefore
also the evangelist, making sure this same point, saith, that the voice
was from the cloud, that is, from God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p69">And what saith the voice? “This is my beloved
Son.” Now if He is beloved, fear not thou, O Peter. For thou
oughtest indeed to know His power already, and to be fully assured
touching His resurrection; but since thou knowest not, at least from
the voice of the Father take courage. For if God be mighty, as surely
He is mighty, very evidently the Son is so likewise. Be not afraid then
of those fearful things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p70">But if as yet thou receive it not, consider at least
that other fact, that He is both a Son, and is beloved. For
“This,” it is said, “is My beloved Son.” Now if
He is beloved, fear not. For no one gives up one whom he loves. Be not
thou therefore confounded; though thou lovest Him beyond measure, thou
lovest Him not as much as He that begat Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p71">“In whom I am well pleased.” For not because
He begat Him only, doth He love Him, but because He is also equal to
Him in all respects, and of one mind with Him. So that the charm of
love is twofold, or rather even threefold, because He is the Son,
because He is beloved, because in Him He is well pleased.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p72">But what means, “In whom I am well pleased?”
As though He had said, “In whom I am refreshed, in whom I take
delight;” because He is in all respects perfectly equal with
Himself, and there is but one will in Him and in the Father, and though
He continue a Son, He is in all respects one with the Father.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p73">“Hear ye Him.” So that although He choose to
be crucified, you are not to oppose Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p76">How was it that, when they heard these words, they were

then did they fall down in the mount? Because there was solitude, and
height, and great quietness, and a transfiguration full of awe, and a
pure light, and a cloud stretched out; all which things put them in
great alarm. And the amazement came thick on every side, and they fell
down both in fear at once and in adoration.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p78">But that the fear abiding so long might not drive out
their recollection, presently He puts an end to their alarm, and is

whether governor, or consul, or what you will, all these dignities
fleet away, and he that is convicted suffers the utmost penalty; much
more will it be so there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p96">8. Therefore that this may not be so, let us lay aside
our filthy garments, let us put on the armor of light, and the glory of
God will wrap us around. For what is even grievous in the injunctions?
or what is there not easy? Hear, for instance, the prophet speaking,
and then thou shalt know the easiness thereof. “Neither though
thou bow as a collar thy neck, and strew beneath thee sackcloth and
ashes, not even so shalt thou call a fast acceptable; but loose every
bond of iniquity, unloose the twisted knots of oppressive
bargains.”<note n="2204" id="iii.LIV-p96.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p97"><scripRef passage="Is. lviii. 6" id="iii.LIV-p97.1" parsed="|Isa|58|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.58.6">Is. lviii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p104">Now in our late discourse which we made unto you when
declaring the rewards, we showed the wealth arising from these acts;
but now let us see if any of the injunctions be grievous, and
transcending our nature. Nay, nothing of the kind shall we discover,
but quite the contrary; that while these courses are very easy, those
of vice are full of labor. For what is more vexatious than to be
lending, and taking thought about usuries and bargains, and demanding
sureties, and fearing and trembling about securities, about the
principal, about the writings, about the interest, about the
bondsmen?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p105">For such is the nature of worldly things; yea, nothing
is so unsound and suspicious as that which is accounted security, and
contrived for that purpose; but to show mercy is easy, and delivers
from all anxiety.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p106">Let us not then traffic in other men’s calamities,
nor make a trade of our benevolence. And I know indeed that many hear
these words with displeasure; but what is the profit of silence? For
though I should hold my peace, and give no trouble by my words, I could
not by this silence deliver you from your punishment; rather it has
altogether the opposite result; the penalty is enhanced, and not to you
only, but to me also, doth such a silence procure punishment. What then
signify our gracious words, when in our works they help us not, but
rather do harm? What is the good of delighting men in word, while we
vex them in deed, bringing pleasure to the ears, and punishment to the
soul? Wherefore I must needs make you sorry here, that we may not
suffer punishment there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p107">9. For indeed a dreadful disease, beloved, dreadful and
needing much attendance, hath fallen on the church. Those, namely, who
are enjoined not even by honest labors to lay up treasures, but to open
their houses to the needy, make a profit of other men’s poverty,
devising a specious robbery, a plausible covetousness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p108">For tell me not of the laws that are without; since even
the publican fulfills the law that is without, but nevertheless is
punished: which will be the case with us also, unless we refrain from
oppressing the poor, and from using their need and necessity as an
occasion for shameless trafficking.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p109">For to this intent thou hast wealth, to relieve poverty,
not to make a gain of poverty; but thou with show of relief makest the
calamity greater, and sellest benevolence for money. Sell it, I forbid
thee not, but for a heavenly kingdom. Receive not a small price for so
good a deed, thy monthly one in the hundred,<note n="2206" id="iii.LIV-p109.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p110"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIV-p110.1">Τκο

selling thy great things for a little, even for goods that perish, when
it should be for an everlasting kingdom? Why dost thou leave God, and
get human gains? Why dost thou pass by the wealthy one, and trouble him
that hath not? and leaving the sure paymaster make thy bargain with the
unthankful? The other longs to repay, but this even grudges in the act
of repaying. This hardly repays a hundredth part, but the other
“an hundredfold and eternal life.” This with insults and
revilings, but the other with praises and auspicious words. This stirs
up envy against thee, but the other even weaves for thee crowns. This
hardly here, but the other both there and here.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p111">Surely then is it not the utmost senselessness, not so
much as to know how to gain? How many have lost their very principal
for the interest’s sake? How many have fallen into perils for
usurious gains. How many have involved both themselves and others in
extreme poverty through their unspeakable covetousness!</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p112">For tell me not this, that he is pleased to receive, and
is thankful for the loan. Why, this is a result of thy cruelty. Since
Abraham too,<note n="2207" id="iii.LIV-p112.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p113"><scripRef passage="Gen. xii. 11" id="iii.LIV-p113.1" parsed="|Gen|12|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.12.11">Gen. xii.

give up his wife to them; not however willingly, but through fear of
Pharaoh. So also the poor man, because thou countest him not even worth
so much money, is actually compelled to be thankful for cruelty.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p114">And it seems to me as though, shouldest thou deliver him
from dangers, thou wouldest exact of him a payment for this
deliverance. “Away,” saith he; “let it not be.”
What sayest thou? Delivering him from the greater evil, thou art
unwilling to exact money, and

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p115">Seest thou not how great a punishment is appointed for
the deed? hearest thou not that even in the old law this is

interest, I give to the poor;” one tells me. Speak reverently, O
man; God desires not such sacrifices. Deal not subtilly with the law.
Better not give to a poor man, than give from that source; for the
money that hath been collected by honest labors, thou often makest to
become unlawful because of that wicked increase; as if one should
compel a fair womb to give birth to scorpions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIV-p118">And if thou wilt ask the Gentile lawgivers too, thou
wilt be told that even by them this thing is deemed a proof of the most
utter shamelessness. Those, for example, who are in offices of honor,

legally disgrace themselves with such gains; there being a law among
them which prohibits the same.<note n="2209" id="iii.LIV-p118.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIV-p119">See Bingham, <i>Antiq</i>. vi. ii. 6, who refers to

What if the fruits of the earth are subject to mischance; hail, and
blight, and excessive rain? yet not to such an extent as are money
dealings. For in whatsoever cases of that sort occur, the damage of
course concerns the produce, but the principal remains, I mean, the
land. But herein many often have suffered shipwreck in their principal;
and before the loss too they are in continual dejection. For never doth
the money-lender enjoy his possessions, nor find pleasure in them; but
when the interest is brought, he rejoices not that he hath received
gain, but is grieved that the interest hath not yet come up to the
principal. And before this evil offspring is brought forth complete, he

and that concerning Elias, not however rightly interpreted by them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p8">For the Scriptures speak of two advents of Christ, both
this that is past, and that which is to come; and declaring these Paul
said, “The grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared,

second, they say Elias will be the forerunner. For of the first, John
was forerunner; whom Christ called also Elias, not because he was
Elias, but because he was fulfilling the ministry of that prophet. For
as the one shall be forerunner of the second advent, so was the other
too of the first. But the Scribes, confusing these things and
perverting the people, made mention of that other only to the people,
the second advent, and said, “If this man is the Christ, Elias
ought to have come beforehand.” Therefore the disciples too speak
as follows, “How then say the Scribes, Elias must first
come?”</p>

also, saying, “Lest I come and utterly smite the earth,”
signifying His second and dreadful advent. For in the first He came not
to smite the earth. For, “I came not,” saith He, “to
judge the world, but to save the world.”<note n="2223" id="iii.LV-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p19"><scripRef passage="John xii. 47" id="iii.LV-p19.1" parsed="|John|12|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.12.47">John xii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p20">To show therefore that the Tishbite comes before that
other advent, which hath the judgment, He said this. And the reason too
of his coming He teaches withal. And what is this reason? That when He
is come, he may persuade the Jews to believe in Christ, and that they
may not all utterly perish at His coming. Wherefore He too, guiding
them on to that remembrance, saith, “And he shall restore all
things;” that is, shall correct the unbelief of the Jews that are
then in being.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p21">Hence the extreme accuracy of his expression; in that he

things are true. Since when He saith, “Elias indeed cometh, and
will restore all things,” He means Elias himself, and the
conversion of the Jews which is then to take place; but when He saith,

everywhere, but to signify His perfect agreement with the Old
Testament, and that this advent too is according to prophecy.</p>

them.” Seest thou how again He in due season reminds them of His
passion, laying up for them great store of comfort from the passion of
John. And not in this way only, but also by presently working great
miracles. Yea, and whensoever He speaks of His passion, presently He
works miracles, both after those sayings and before them; and in many
places one may find Him to have kept this rule.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p36">“Then,” for instance, it saith, “He

afforded them much consolation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p43">But should any one say, “Wherefore did He not even
now raise up Elias and send him, witnessing as He doth so great good of
his coming?” we should reply, that even as it was, while thinking
Christ to be Elias, they did not believe Him. For “some
say,” such are the words, “that Thou art Elias, and others,
Jeremias.”<note n="2235" id="iii.LV-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p44"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 14" id="iii.LV-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|16|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.14">Matt. xvi.

only. “Then how will they believe at that time?” it may be
said. Why, “he will restore all things,” not simply by
being recognized, but also because the glory of Christ will have been
growing more intense up to that day, and will be among all clearer than
the sun. When therefore, preceded by such an opinion and expectation,
he comes making the same proclamation as John, and himself also
announcing Jesus, they will more easily receive his sayings. But in
saying, “They knew him not,” He is excusing also what was
done in His own case.<note n="2236" id="iii.LV-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p45">Comp. <scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 24" id="iii.LV-p45.1" parsed="|Luke|23|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.24">Luke

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p46">And not in this way only doth He console them, but also
by pointing out that John’s sufferings at their hands, whatever
they are, are undeserved; and by His throwing into the shade what would
annoy them, by means of two signs, the one on the mountain, the other
just about to take place.</p>

“that the devil went not out, why doth He blame the

sick in faith, they might in many instances work a cure. For as the
faith of the person presenting oftentimes availed for receiving the
cure, even from inferior ministers; so the power of the doers
oftentimes sufficed, even without belief in those who came to work the
miracle.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p59">And both these things are signified in the Scripture.

that cast him down, not for faith but for cowardice did they cast him,
unintentionally and by chance, for fear of the band of robbers, and so
they fled: while the person himself that was cast in was dead, yet by
the mere virtue of the holy body the dead man arose.</p>

Jesus against His disciples, saying, “I brought him to Thy
disciples, and they could not cure him.”</p>

thing an object of desire, and His departure longed for, and that not
crucifixion, but being with them, is grievous.</p>

evil.</p>

(accordingly, when a crowd began to gather, He proceeded to rebuke
him), but for the father’s own sake, that when he should see the

no other way, he might be led to believe the coming miracle.</p>

His words, said, “I will, be thou clean;” in this
man’s case, upon his uttering a speech in no way worthy of His
power,—“If Thou canst, help me,”—see how He
corrects it, as not rightly spoken. For what saith He? “If thou
canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”<note n="2252" id="iii.LV-p71.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p72"><scripRef passage="Mark ix. 23" id="iii.LV-p72.1" parsed="|Mark|9|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.9.23">Mark ix.

that I can even make others work these miracles. So that if thou
believe as one ought, even thou thyself art able,” saith He,
“to heal both this one, and many others.” And having thus
said, He set free the possessed of the devil.</p>

Since surely, unless the man had been favored with much providential
care even then, he would have perished long ago; for “it cast him
both into the fire,” so it is said, “and into the
water.” And he that dared this would assuredly have destroyed the

curb: as indeed was the case with those naked men that were running in

whether she be free or a slave. For the free woman behaves herself
unseemly in the midst of her slaves as spectators, and the slave again
in like manner in the midst of the slaves, and they cause the gifts of
God to be blasphemously spoken of by foolish men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p77">For instance, I hear many say, when these excesses
happen, “Would there were no wine.” O folly! O madness!
When other men sin, dost thou find fault with God’s gifts? And
what great madness is this? What? did the wine, O man, produce this
evil? Not the wine, but the intemperance of such as take an evil
delight in it. Say then, “Would there were no drunkenness, no
luxury;” but if thou say, “Would there were no wine,”
thou wilt say, going on by degrees, “Would there were no steel,
because of the murderers; no night, because of the thieves; no light,
because of the informers; no women, because of adulteries;” and,
in a word, thou wilt destroy all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p78">But do not so; for this is of a satanical mind; do not
find fault with the wine, but with the drunkenness; and when thou hast
found this self-same man sober, sketch out all his unseemliness, and
say unto him, Wine was given, that we might be cheerful, not that we
might behave ourselves unseemly; that we might laugh, not that we might
be a laughingstock; that we might be healthful, not that we might be
diseased; that we might correct the weakness of our body, not cast down
the might of our soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p79">God honored thee with the gift, why disgrace thyself
with the excess thereof? Hear what Paul saith, “Use a little wine

him; what excuse shall we have,
who are drunken in health? To him indeed He said, “Use a little
wine for thy stomach’s sake;” but to each of you who are
drunken, He will say, “Use little wine, for thy fornications, thy
frequent filthy talking, for the other wicked desires to which
drunkenness is wont to give birth.” But if ye are not willing,
for these reasons, to abstain; at least on account of the despondencies
which come of it, and the vexations, do ye abstain. For wine was given
for gladness, “Yea, wine,” so it is said, “maketh
glad the heart of man:”<note n="2256" id="iii.LV-p80.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p81"><scripRef passage="Ps. civ. 15" id="iii.LV-p81.1" parsed="|Ps|4|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.4.15">Ps. civ.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p90">See how He neither declines the tribute, nor simply
commands to pay it, but having first proved Himself not liable to it,
then He gives it: the one to save the people, the other, those around
Him, from offense. For He gives it not at all as a debt, but as doing
the best<note n="2262" id="iii.LV-p90.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p91"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p91.1">διορθνμενο</span>

He was discoursing of meats,<note n="2263" id="iii.LV-p91.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p92"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 11" id="iii.LV-p92.1" parsed="|Matt|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.11">Matt. xv.

offended, and at what to disregard them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p93">And indeed by the very mode of giving He discloses
Himself again. For wherefore doth He not command him to give of what
they have laid up? That, as I have said, herein also He might signify
Himself to be God of all, and the sea also to be under His rule. For He
had indeed signified this even already, by His rebuke, and by His
commanding this same Peter to walk on the waves; but He now again
signifies the self-same thing, though in another way, yet so as to
cause herein great amazement. For neither was it a small thing, to
foretell that the first, who out of those depths should come in his
way, would be the fish that would pay the tribute; and having cast
forth His commandment like a net into that abyss, to bring up the one
that bore the piece of money; but it was of a divine and unutterable
power, thus to make even the sea bear gifts, and that its subjection to
Him should be shown on all hands, as well when in its madness it was
silent,<note n="2264" id="iii.LV-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p94"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 26" id="iii.LV-p94.1" parsed="|Matt|8|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.26">Matt. viii.

demanding it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p96">“And give unto them,” He saith, “for
me and thee.” Seest thou the exceeding greatness of the honor?
See also the self-command of Peter’s mind. For this point Mark,
the follower of this apostle, doth not appear to have set down, because
it indicated the great honor paid to him; but while of the denial he
wrote as well as the rest, the things that make him illustrious he hath
passed over in silence, his master perhaps entreating him not to
mention the great things about himself. And He used the phrase,
“for me and thee,” because Peter too was a firstborn
child.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p97">Now as thou art amazed at Christ’s power, so I bid
thee admire also the disciple’s faith, that to a thing beyond
possibility he so gave ear. For indeed it was very far beyond
possibility by nature. Wherefore also in requital for his faith, He
joined him to Himself in the payment of the tribute.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p98">3. “In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus,
saying, Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”<note n="2266" id="iii.LV-p98.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p99"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 1" id="iii.LV-p99.1" parsed="|Matt|18|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.1">Matt.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p100">The disciples experienced some feeling of human
weakness; wherefore the evangelist also adds this note, saying,
“In that hour;” when He had preferred him to all. For of
James too, and John, one was a firstborn son, but no such thing as this
had He done for them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p101">Then, being ashamed to avow their feeling, they say not
indeed openly, “Wherefore hast thou preferred Peter to us?”
or, “Is he greater than we are?” for they were ashamed; but
indefinitely they ask, “Who then is greater?” For when they
saw the three preferred, they felt nothing of the kind; but now that
the honor had come round to one, they were vexed. And not for this
only, but there were many other things which they put together to
kindle that feeling. For to him He had said, “I will give thee
the keys;”<note n="2267" id="iii.LV-p101.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p102"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 19" id="iii.LV-p102.1" parsed="|Matt|16|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.19">Matt. xvi.

“Give unto them for me and thee;” and seeing too in general
how freely he was allowed to speak, it somewhat fretted them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p103">And if Mark saith,<note n="2268" id="iii.LV-p103.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p104"><scripRef passage="Mark ix. 34" id="iii.LV-p104.1" parsed="|Mark|9|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.9.34">Mark ix.

<pb n="342" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_342.html" id="iii.LV-Page_342" />

but
reasoned in themselves, that is nothing contrary to this. For it is
likely that they did both the one and the other, and whereas before, on
another occasion, they had had this feeling, both once and twice, that
now they did both declare it, and reason among themselves.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p105">But to thee I say, “Look not to the charge against
them only, but consider this too; first, that they seek none of the
things of this world; next, that even this passion they afterwards laid
aside, and give up the first place one to another.” But we are
not able to attain so much as unto their faults, neither do we seek,
“who is greatest<note n="2269" id="iii.LV-p105.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p106">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p106.1">μεζων</span> “greater.”]</p></note>in the kingdom of heaven;” but, who is greatest<note n="2270" id="iii.LV-p106.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p107">[R.V., “Except ye turn, and become as little
children,” but Chrysostom substitutes “this little
child.”—R.]</p></note>in the earthly kingdom, who is wealthiest, who most powerful.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p108">What then saith Christ? He unveils their conscience, and
replies to their feeling, not merely to their words. “For He
called a little child unto Him,” saith the Scripture, “and
said, Except ye be converted, and become as this little child, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”<note n="2271" id="iii.LV-p108.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p109"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 2, 3" id="iii.LV-p109.1" parsed="|Matt|18|2|18|3" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.2-Matt.18.3">Matt.
xviii. 2, 3</scripRef>.</p></note>“Why, you,” He saith, “inquire who is greatest, and
are contentious for first honors; but I pronounce him, that is not
become lowest of all, unworthy so much as to enter in
thither.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p110">And full well doth He both allege that pattern, and not
allege it only, but also set the child in the midst, by the very sight
abashing them, and persuading them to be in like manner lowly and
artless. Since both from envy the little child is pure, and from
vainglory, and from longing for the first place; and he is possessed of
the greatest of virtues, simplicity, and whatever is artless and
lowly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p111">Not courage then only is wanted, nor wisdom, but this
virtue also, humility I mean, and simplicity. Yea, and the things that
belong to our salvation halt even in the chiefest point, if these be
not with us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p112">The little child, whether it be insulted and beaten, or
honored and glorified, neither by the one is it moved to impatience or
envy, nor by the other lifted up.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p113">Seest thou how again He calls us on to all natural
excellencies, indicating that of free choice it is possible to attain
them, and so silences the wicked frenzy of the Manichæans? For if
nature be an evil thing, wherefore doth He draw from hence His patterns
of severe goodness?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p114">And the child which He set in the midst I suppose to
have been a very young child indeed, free from all these passions. For
such a little child is free from pride and the mad desire of glory, and
envy, and contentiousness, and all such passions, and having many
virtues, simplicity, humility, unworldliness,<note n="2272" id="iii.LV-p114.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p115"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p115.1">ἀπραγμοσνην</span>
.</p></note>prides itself upon none of them; which is a twofold severity of
goodness; to have these things, and not to be puffed up about them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p116">Wherefore He brought it in, and set it in the midst; and
not at this merely did He conclude His discourse, but carries further
this admonition, saying, “And whoso shall receive such a little
child in my name, receiveth me.”<note n="2273" id="iii.LV-p116.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p117"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 5" id="iii.LV-p117.1" parsed="|Matt|18|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.5">Matt.
xviii. 5</scripRef>. [“one such
little child,” rec. text; so R.V.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p118">“For know,” saith He, “that not only,
if ye yourselves become like this, shall ye receive a great reward; but
also if for my sake ye honor others who are such, even for your honor
to them do I appoint unto you a kingdom as your recompence.” Or
rather, He sets down what is far greater, saying, “he receiveth
me. So exceedingly dear to me is all that is lowly and artless.”
For by “a little child,” here, He means the men that are
thus simple and lowly, and abject and contemptible in the judgment of
the common sort.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p119">4. After this, to obtain yet more acceptance for His
saying, He establishes it not by the honor only, but also by the
punishment, going on to say, “And whoso shall offend one of these
little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about
his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.”<note n="2274" id="iii.LV-p119.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p120"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 6" id="iii.LV-p120.1" parsed="|Matt|18|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.6">Matt.

whoso shall cause one of these little ones which believe in me to
stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone (Greek, a
millstone turned by an ass) should be hanged about his neck, and that
he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.” The Greek text of
Chrysostom agrees very closely with the received, but omits
“which believe in me.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p121">“For as they,” saith He, “who honor
these for my sake, have heaven, or rather an honor greater than the
very kingdom; even so they likewise who dishonor them (for this is to
offend them), shall suffer the extremity of punishment. And marvel thou
not at His calling the affront “an offense;”<note n="2275" id="iii.LV-p121.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p122">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p122.1">σκνδαλον</span>,
“stumbling block.”]</p></note>for many feeble-minded persons have suffered no ordinary offense from
being treated with slight and insult. To heighten therefore and
aggravate the blame, He states the mischief arising therefrom.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p123">And He doth not go on to express the punishment in the
same way, but from the things familiar to us, He indicates how
intolerable it is. For when He would touch the grosser sort most
sharply, He brings sensible images. Wherefore here also, meaning to

<pb n="343" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_343.html" id="iii.LV-Page_343" />

indicate the greatness of the
punishment they shall undergo, and to strike into the arrogance of
those that despise them, He brought forward a kind of sensible
punishment, that of the millstone, and of the drowning. Yet surely it
were suitable to what had gone before to have said, “He that
receiveth not one of these little ones, receiveth not me;” a
thing bitterer than any punishment; but since the very unfeeling, and
exceeding gross, were not so much penetrated by this, terrible as it
is, He puts “a millstone,” and “a drowning.”
And He said not, “A millstone shall be hanged about his
neck,” but, “It were better for him”<note n="2276" id="iii.LV-p123.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p124">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p124.1">συμφερε ατ</span>,
“it is profitable for him.”]</p></note>to undergo this; implying that another evil, more grievous than this,
awaits him; and if this be unbearable, much more that.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p125">Seest thou how in both respects He made His threat
terrible, first by the comparison with the known image rendering it
more distinct, then by the excess on its side presenting it to the
fancy as far greater than that visible one. Seest thou how He plucks up
by the root the spirit of arrogance; how He heals the ulcer of
vainglory; how He instructs us in nothing to set our heart on the first
honors; how He persuades such as covet them in everything to follow
after the lowest place?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p126">5. For nothing is worse than arrogance.<note n="2277" id="iii.LV-p126.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p127"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p127.1">ἀπονοα</span>.</p></note> This even takes men out of their natural senses, and brings upon them
the character of fools; or rather, it really makes them to be utterly
like idiots.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p128">For like as, if any one, being three cubits in stature,
were to strive to be higher than the mountains, or actually to think
it, and draw himself up, as overpassing their summits, we should seek
no other proof of his being out of his senses; so also when thou seest
a man arrogant, and thinking himself superior to all, and accounting it
a degradation to live with other people, seek not thou after that to
see any other proof of that man’s madness. Why, he is much more
ridiculous than any natural fool, inasmuch as he absolutely creates
this his disease on purpose. And not in this only is he wretched, but
because he doth without feeling it fall into the very gulf of
wickedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p129">For when will such an one come to due knowledge of any
sin? when will he perceive that he is offending? Nay, rather he is as a
vile and captive slave, whom the devil having caught goes off with, and
makes him altogether a prey, buffetting him on every side, and
encompassing him with ten thousand insults.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p130">For unto such great folly doth he lead them in the end,
as to get them to be haughty towards their children, and wives, and
towards their own forefathers. And others, on the contrary, He causes
to be puffed up by the distinction of their ancestors. Now, what can be
more foolish than this? when from opposite causes people are alike
puffed up, the one sort because they had mean persons for fathers,
grandfathers, and ancestors; and the other because theirs were glorious
and distinguished? How then may one abate in each case the swelling
sore? By saying to these last, “Go farther back than your
grandfather, and immediate ancestors, and you will find perchance many
cooks, and drivers of asses, and shopkeepers:” but to the former,
that are puffed up by the meanness of their forefathers, the contrary
again; “And thou again, if thou proceed farther up among thy
forefathers, wilt find many far more illustrious than thou
art.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p131">For that nature hath this course, come let me prove it
to thee even from the Scriptures. Solomon was son of a king, and of an
illustrious king, but that king’s father was one of the vile and
ignoble. And his grandfather on his mother’s side in like manner;
for else he would not have given his daughter to a mere soldier. And if
thou wert to go up again higher from these mean persons, thou wilt see
the race more illustrious and royal. So in Saul’s case too, so in
many others also, one shall come to this result. Let us not then pride
ourselves herein. For what is birth? tell me. Nothing, but a name only
without a substance; and this ye will know in that day. But because
that day is not yet come, let us now even from the things present
persuade you, that hence arises no superiority. For should war overtake
us, should famine, should anything else, all these inflated conceits of
noble birth are put to the proof: should disease, should pestilence
come upon us, it knows not how to distinguish between the rich and the
poor, the glorious and inglorious, the high born and him that is not
such; neither doth death, nor the other reverses of fortune, but they
all rise up alike against all; and if I may say something that is even
marvellous, against the rich more of the two. For by how much they are
less exercised in these things, so much the more do they perish, when
overtaken by them. And the fear too is greater with the rich. For none
so tremble at princes as they; and at multitudes, not less than at
princes, yea rather much more; many such houses in fact have been
subverted alike by the wrath of multitudes and the threatening of
princes. But

the poor man is
exempt from both these kinds of troubled waters.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p132">6. Wherefore let alone this nobility, and if thou
wouldest show me that thou art noble, show the freedom of thy soul,
such as that blessed man had (and he a poor man), who said to Herod,
“It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip’s
wife;”<note n="2278" id="iii.LV-p132.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p133"><scripRef passage="Mark vi. 18" id="iii.LV-p133.1" parsed="|Mark|6|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.6.18">Mark vi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p135">But not like this are the souls of them that are slaves
to wealth, but as they that are under ten thousand tutors, and
taskmasters, so these dare not so much as lift up their eye, and speak
boldly in behalf of virtue. For the love of riches, and that of glory,
and that of other things, looking terribly on them, make them slavish
flatterers; there being nothing which so takes away liberty, as
entanglement in worldly affairs, and the wearing what are accounted
marks of distinction. For such an one hath not one master, nor two, nor
three, but ten thousand.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p136">And if ye would fain even number them, let us bring in
some one of those that are in honor in kings’ courts, and let him
have both very much wealth, and great power, and a birthplace excelling
others, and distinction of ancestry, and let him be looked up to by all
men. Now then let us see, if this be not the very person to be more in
slavery than all; and let us set in comparison with him, not a slave
merely, but a slave’s slave, for many though servants have
slaves. This slave’s slave then for his part hath but one master.
And what though that one be not a freeman? yet he is but one, and the
other looks only to his pleasure. For albeit his master’s master
seem to have power over him, yet for the present he obeys one only; and
if matters between them two are well, he will abide in security all his
life. But our man hath not one or two only, but many, and more grievous
masters. And first he is in care about the sovereign himself. And it is
not the same to have a mean person for a master, as to have a king,
whose ears are buzzed into by many, and who becomes a property now to
this set and now to that.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p137">Our man, though conscious of nothing, suspects all; both
his comrades and his subordinates; both his friends and his
enemies.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p138">But the other man too, you may say, fears his master.
But how is it the same thing, to have one or many, to make one
timorous? Or rather, if a man inquire carefully, he will not find so
much as one. How, and in what sense? Whereas that slave hath no one
that desires to put him out of that service of his, and to introduce
himself (whence neither hath he any one to plot against him therein);
these have not even any other pursuit, but to unsettle him that is more
approved and more beloved by their ruler. Wherefore also he must needs
flatter all, his superiors, his equals, his friends. For where envy is,
and love of glory, there even sincere friendship has no strength. For
as those of the same craft cannot love one another with a perfect and
genuine love, so is it with rivals in honor also, and with them that
long for the same among worldly objects. Whence also great is the war
within.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p139">Seest thou what a swarm of masters, and of hard masters?
Wilt thou that I show thee yet another, more grievous than this? They
that are behind him, all of them strive to get before him: all that are
before him, to hinder him from coming nearer them, and passing them
by.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p140">7. But O marvel! I undertook indeed to show you masters,
but our discourse, we find, coming on and waxing eager, hath performed
more than my undertaking, pointing out foes instead of masters; or
rather the same persons both as foes and as masters. For while they are
courted like masters, they are terrible as foes, and they plot against
us as enemies. When then any one hath the same persons both as masters,
and as enemies, what can be worse than this calamity? The slave indeed,
though he be subject to command, yet nevertheless hath the advantage of
care and good-will on the part of them who give him orders; but these,
while they receive commands, are made enemies, and are set one against
another; and that so much more grievously than those in battles, in
that they both wound secretly, and in the mask of friends they treat
men as their enemies would do, and oftentimes make themselves credit of
the calamity of others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p148">And, if thou wilt, let us first bring forward glory, so
lovely and desirable with all of them. And I speak not of its being
short-lived, and soon put out, but when it is in its bloom, then show
it me. Take not away the daubings and colored lines of the harlot, but
bring her forward decked out, and exhibit her to us, for me thereupon
to expose her deformity. Well then, of course thou wilt tell of her
array, and her many lictors, and the heralds’ voice, and the
listening of all classes, and the silence kept by the populace, and the
blows given to all that come in one’s way, and the universal
gazing. Are not these her splendors? Come then, let us examine whether
these things be not vain, and a mere unprofitable imagination. For
wherein is the person we speak of the better for these things, either
in body, or in soul? for this constitutes the man. Will he then be
taller hereby, or stronger, or healthier, or swifter, or will he have
his senses keener, and more piercing? Nay, no one could say this. Let
us go then to the soul, if haply we may find there any advantage
occurring herefrom. What then? Will such a one be more temperate, more
gentle, more prudent, through that kind of attendance? By no means, but
rather quite the contrary. For not as in the body, so also is the
result here. For there the body indeed gains nothing in respect of its
proper excellence; but here the mischief is not only the soul’s
reaping no good fruit, but also its actually receiving much evil
therefrom: hurried as it is by such means into haughtiness, and
vainglory, and folly, and wrath, and ten thousand faults like them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p149">“But he rejoices,” thou wilt say, “and
exults in these things, and they brighten him up.” The crowning
point<note n="2285" id="iii.LV-p149.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p150"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p150.1">κολοφνα</span>.</p></note>of his evils lies in that word of thine, and the incurable part of the
disease. For he that rejoices in these things, would be unwilling
however easily to be released from that which is the ground of his
evils; yea, he hath blocked up against himself the way of healing by
this delight. So that here most of all is the mischief, that he is not
even pained, but rather rejoices, when the diseases are growing upon
him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p151">For neither is rejoicing always a good thing; since even
thieves rejoice in stealing, and an adulterer in defiling his
neighbor’s marriage bed, and the covetous in spoiling by
violence, and the manslayer in murdering. Let us not then look whether
he rejoice, but whether it be for something profitable, lest<note n="2286" id="iii.LV-p151.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p152">[The Greek text has <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LV-p152.1">διασκεψμεθα</span>,
which the translator has ignored: “Let us consider well,
lest,” etc.—R.]</p></note>perchance we find his joy to be such as that of the adulterer and the
thief.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p153">For wherefore, tell me, doth he rejoice? For his credit
with the multitude, because he can puff himself up, and be gazed upon?
Nay, what can be worse than this desire, and this ill-placed fondness?
or if it be no bad thing, ye must leave off deriding the vainglorious
and aspersing them with continual mockeries: ye must leave off uttering
imprecations on the haughty and contemptuous. But ye would not endure
it. Well then, they too deserve plenty of censure, though they have
plenty of lictors. And all this I have said of the more tolerable sort
of rulers; since the greater part of them we shall find transgressing
more grievously than either robbers, or murderers, or adulterers, or
spoilers of tombs, from not making a good use of their power. For
indeed both their thefts are more shameless, and their butcheries more
hardened, and their impurities far more enormous than the others; and
they dig through, not one wall, but estates and houses without end,
their prerogative making it very easy to them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p154">And they serve a most grievous servitude, both stooping
basely under their passions,<note n="2287" id="iii.LV-p154.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LV-p155">[Some <span class="c20" id="iii.LV-p155.1">mss</span>. insert here:

brackets by Field.—R.]</p></note>and trembling at all their accomplices. For he only is free, and he
only a ruler, and more kingly than all kings, who is delivered from his
passions.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LV-p156">Knowing then these things, let us follow after the true
freedom, and deliver ourselves from the evil slavery, and let us
account neither pomp of power nor dominion of wealth, nor any other
such thing, to be blessed; but virtue only. For thus shall we both
enjoy security here, and attain unto the good things to come, by the
grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
and might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c53" id="iii.LVI-p3"><i>Woe unto the world because of offenses:</i><note n="2288" id="iii.LVI-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p4">[R.V., “occasions of stumbling,” <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVI-p4.1">σκανδλων</span>; see the
comment below.]</p></note><i>for it must needs be that offenses come: but woe to that man by</i><note n="2289" id="iii.LVI-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p5">[R.V., “through.”]</p></note><i>whom the offense cometh.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.LVI-p6">“<span class="c20" id="iii.LVI-p6.1">And</span> if ‘it must
needs be that offenses come,’” (some one of our adversaries
may perchance say), “why doth He lament over the world, when He
ought rather to afford succor, and to stretch forth His hand in its
behalf? For this were the part of a physician, and a protector, whereas
the other might be looked for even from any ordinary person.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p7">What then could we possibly say, in answer to so
shameless a tongue? nay what dost thou seek for equal to this healing
care of His? For indeed being God He became man for thee, and took the
form of a slave, and underwent all extremities, and left undone none of
those things which it concerned Him to do. But inasmuch as unthankful
men were nothing the better for this, He laments over them, for that
after so much fostering care they continued in their unsoundness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p8">It was like as if over the sick man, that had had the
advantage of much attendance, and who had not been willing to obey the
rules of the physician, any one were to lament and say, “Woe to
such a man from his infirmity, which he has increased by his own
remissness.” But in that case indeed there is no advantage from
the bewailing, but here this too is a kind of healing treatment to
foretell what would be, and to lament it. For many oftentimes, though,
when advised, they were nothing profited, yet, when mourned for, they
amended.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p9">For which reason most of all He used the word
“Woe,” thoroughly to rouse them, and to make them in
earnest, and to work upon them to be wakeful. And at the same time He
shows forth the good will He had towards those very men and His own
mildness, that He mourns for them even when gainsaying, not taking mere
disgust at it, but correcting them, both with the mourning, and with
the prediction, so as to win them over.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p10">But how is this possible? he may say. For if “it
must needs be that offenses come,” how is it possible to escape
these? Because that the offenses come indeed must needs be, but that
men should perish is not altogether of necessity. Like as though a
physician should say (for nothing hinders our using the same
illustration again), it must needs be that this disease should come on,
but it is not a necessary consequence that he who gives heed should be
of course destroyed by the disease. And this He said, as I mentioned,
to awaken together with the others His disciples. For that they may not
slumber, as sent unto peace and unto untroubled life, He shows many
wars close upon them, from without, from within. Declaring this, Paul
said, “Without were fightings, within were fears;”<note n="2290" id="iii.LVI-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p11"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. vii. 5" id="iii.LVI-p11.1" parsed="|2Cor|7|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.7.5">2 Cor. vii.

26</scripRef>.</p></note>and in his discourse to the Milesians too He said, “Also of you
shall some arise speaking perverse things;”<note n="2292" id="iii.LVI-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p13"><scripRef passage="Acts xx. 30" id="iii.LVI-p13.1" parsed="|Acts|20|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.20.30">Acts xx.

his own household.”<note n="2293" id="iii.LVI-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 36" id="iii.LVI-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|10|36|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.36">Matt. x.
36</scripRef>.</p></note> But when He said, “It must needs be,” it is not as taking
away the power of choosing for themselves, nor the freedom of the moral
principle, nor as placing man’s life under any absolute
constraint of circumstances, that He saith these things, but He
foretells what would surely be; and this Luke hath set forth in another
form of expression, “It is impossible but that offenses should
come.”<note n="2294" id="iii.LVI-p14.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p15"><scripRef passage="Luke xvii. 1" id="iii.LVI-p15.1" parsed="|Luke|17|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.17.1">Luke xvii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p16">But what are the offenses?<note n="2295" id="iii.LVI-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p17"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVI-p17.1">σκνδαλα</span>.</p></note> The hindrances on the right way. Thus also do those on the stage call
them that are skilled in those matters, them that distort their
bodies.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p18">It is not then His prediction that brings the offenses;
far from it; neither because He foretold it, therefore doth it take
place; but because it surely was to be, therefore He foretold it; since
if those who bring in the offenses had not been minded to do wickedly,
neither would the offenses have come; and if they had not been to come,
neither would they have been foretold. But because those men did evil,
and were incurably diseased, the offenses came, and He foretells that
which is to be.</p>

<pb n="347" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_347.html" id="iii.LVI-Page_347" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p19">But if these men had been kept right, it may be said,
and there had been no one to bring in an offense, would not this saying
have been convicted of falsehood? By no means, for neither would it
have been spoken. For if all were to have been kept right, He would not
have said, “it must needs be that they come,” but because
He foreknew they would be of themselves incorrigible, therefore He
said, the offenses will surely come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p20">And wherefore did He not take them out of the way? it
may be said. Why, wherefore should they have been taken out of the way?
For the sake of them that are hurt? But not thence is the ruin of them
that are hurt, but from their own remissness. And the virtuous prove
it, who, so far from being injured thereby, are even in the greatest
degree profited, such as was Job, such as was Joseph, such as were all
the righteous, and the apostles. But if many perish, it is from their
own slumbering. But if it were not so, but the ruin was the effect of
the offenses, all must have perished. And if there are those who
escape, let him who doth not escape impute it to himself. For the
offenses, as I have said, awaken, and render more quick-sighted, and
sharper, not only him that is preserved; but even him that hath fallen
into them, if he rise up again quickly, for they render him more safe,
and make him more difficult to overcome; so that if we be watchful, no
small profit do we reap from hence, even to be continually awake. For
if when we have enemies, and when so many dangers are pressing upon us,
we sleep, what should we be if living in security. Nay, if thou wilt,
look at the first man. For if having lived in paradise a short time,
perchance not so much as a whole day, and having enjoyed delights, he
drove on to such a pitch of wickedness, as even to imagine an equality
with God, and to account the deceiver a benefactor, and not to keep to
one commandment; if he had lived the rest of his life also without
affliction, what would he not have done?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p21">2. But when we say these things, they make other
objections again, asking, And why did God make him such? God did not
make him such, far from it, since then neither would He have punished
him. For if we in those matters in which we are the cause, do not find
fault with our servant, much more will not the God of all. “But
whence did this come to pass?” one may say. Of himself and his
own remissness. “What means, of himself?” Ask thyself. For
if it be not of themselves the bad are bad, do not punish thy servant
nor reprove thy wife for what errors she may commit, neither beat thy
son, nor blame thy friend, nor hate thine enemy that doth despite to
thee: for all these deserve to be pitied, not to be punished, unless
they offend of themselves. “But I am not able to practise
self-restraint,” one may say. And yet, when thou perceivest the
cause not to be with them, but of another necessity, thou canst
practise self-restraint. When at least a servant being taken with
sickness doth not the things enjoined him, so far from blaming thou
dost rather excuse him. Thus thou art a witness, that the one thing is
of one’s self, the other not of one’s self. So that here
too, if thou knewest that he was wicked from being born such, so far
from blaming, thou wouldest rather have shown him indulgence. For
surely, when thou makest him allowance for his illness, it could not be
that thou wouldest have refused to make allowance for God’s act
of creation, if indeed he had been made such from the very first.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p22">And in another way too it is easy to stop the mouths of
such men, for great is the abounding power of the truth. For wherefore
dost thou never find fault with thy servant, because he is not of a
beautiful countenance, that he is not of fine stature in his body, that
he is not able to fly? Because these things are natural. So then from
blame against his nature he is acquitted, and no man gainsays it. When
therefore thou blamest, thou showest that the fault is not of nature
but of his choice. For if in those things, which we do not blame, we
bear witness that the whole is of nature, it is evident that where we
reprove, we declare that the offense is of the choice.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p23">Do not then bring forward, I beseech thee, perverse
reasonings, neither sophistries and webs slighter than the
spider’s, but answer me this again: Did God make all men? It is
surely plain to every man. How then are not all equal in respect of
virtue and vice? whence are the good, and gentle, and meek? whence are
the worthless and evil? For if these things do not require any purpose,
but are of nature, how are the one this, the others that? For if by
nature all were bad, it were not possible for any one to be good, but
if good by nature, then no one bad. For if there were one nature of all
men, they must needs in this respect be all one, whether they were to
be this, or whether they were to be that.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p24">But if we should say that by nature the one are good,
the other bad, which would not be reasonable (as we have shown), these
things must be unchangeable, for the things of nature are unchangeable.
Nay, mark. All

<pb n="348" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_348.html" id="iii.LVI-Page_348" />

mortals are also
liable to suffering; and no one is free from suffering, though he
strive without end. But now we see of good many becoming worthless, and
of worthless good, the one through remissness, the other by
earnestness; which thing most of all indicates that these things do not
come of nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p25">For the things of nature are neither changed, nor do
they need diligence for their acquisition. For like as for seeing and
hearing we do not need labor, so neither should we need toils in
virtue, if it had been apportioned by nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p26">“But wherefore did He at all make worthless men,
when He might have made all men good? Whence then are the evil
things?” saith he. Ask thyself; for it is my part to show they
are not of nature, nor from God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p27">“Come they then of themselves?” he saith. By
no means. “But are they unoriginated?” Speak reverently, O
man, and start back from this madness, honoring with one honor God and
the evil things, and that honor the highest. For if they be unoriginate
they are mighty, and cannot so much as be plucked up, nor pass into
annihilation. For that what is unoriginate is imperishable, is surely
manifest to all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p28">3. And whence also are there so many good, when evil
hath such great power? how are they that have an origin stronger than
that which is unoriginate?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p29">“But God destroys these things,” he saith.
When? And how will He destroy what are of equal honor, and of equal
strength, and of the same age, as one might say, with Himself?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p30">Oh malice of the devil! how great an evil hath he
invented! With what blasphemy hath he persuaded men to surround God!
with what cloak of godliness hath he devised another profane account?
For desiring to show, that not of Him was the evil, they brought in
another evil doctrine, saying, that these things are unoriginate.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p31">“Whence then are evils?” one may say. From
willing and not willing. “But the very thing of our willing and
not willing, whence is it?” From ourselves. But thou dost the
same in asking, as if when thou hadst asked, whence is seeing and not
seeing? then when I said, from closing the eyes or not closing the
eyes, thou wert to ask again; the very closing the eyes or not, whence
is it? then having heard that it was of ourselves, and our will, thou
wert to seek again another cause.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p32">For evil is nothing else than disobedience to God.
“Whence then,” one may say, “did man find
this?” “Why, was it a task to find this? I pray
thee.” “Nay, neither do I say this, that this thing is
difficult; but whence became he desirous to disobey.” “From
remissness. For having power for either, he inclined rather to
this.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p33">But if thou art perplexed yet and dizzy at hearing this,
I will ask thee nothing difficult nor involved, but a simple and plain
question. Hast thou become some time bad? and hast thou become some
time also good? What I mean, is like this. Didst thou prevail some time
over passion, and wast thou taken again by passion? Hast thou been
overtaken by drunkenness, and hast thou prevailed over drunkenness?
Wast thou once moved to wrath, and again not moved to wrath? Didst thou
overlook a poor man, and not overlook him? Didst thou commit whoredom
once? and didst thou become chaste again? Whence then are all these
things? tell me, whence? Nay if thou thyself do not tell, I will say.
Because at one time thou didst restrain thyself and strive, but after
that thou becamest remiss and careless. For to those that are
desperate, and are continually in wickedness, and are in a state of
senselessness, and are mad, and who are not willing so much as to hear
what will amend them, I will not even discourse of self restraint; but
to them that have been sometimes in the one, and sometimes in the
other, I will gladly speak. Didst thou once take by violence the things
that belonged not to thee; and after this, subdued by pity, didst
impart even of thine unto him that was in need? Whence then this
change? Is it not quite plain it is from the mind, and the choice of
will?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p34">It is quite plain, and there is no one who would not say
this. Wherefore I entreat you to be in earnest, and to cleave to
virtue, and ye will have no need of these questions. For our evils are
mere names, if we be willing. Inquire not then whence are evils,
neither perplex thyself; but having found that they are from remissness
only, flee the evil deeds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p35">And if any one should say, that these things come not
from us; whenever thou seest him angry with his servants, and provoked
with his wife, and blaming a child, and condemning them who injure him,
say to him, how then saidst thou, that evils come not from us? For if
they be not from us, wherefore dost thou find fault? Say again; is it
of thyself thou revilest, and insultest? For if it be not of thyself,
let no man be angry with thee; but if it be of thyself, of thyself and
of thy remissness are thy evil deeds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p36">But what? thinkest thou there are some good men? For if
indeed no man is good,

<pb n="349" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_349.html" id="iii.LVI-Page_349" />

whence hast
thou this word? whence are praises? But if there are good men, it is
quite plain that they will also reprove the bad. Yet if no one is
voluntarily wicked, nor of himself, the good will be found to be
unjustly reproving the bad, and they themselves too will be in this way
bad again. For what can be worse than to subject the guiltless to
accusations? But if they continue in our estimation good men, though
reproving, and this especially is a proof of their goodness, even to
the very fools it is hereby plain, that no one is ever by necessity
bad.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p37">But if after all this thou wouldest still inquire,
whence are evils? I would say, from remissness, from idleness, from
keeping company with the bad, from contempt of virtue; hence are both
the evils themselves, and the fact that some inquire, whence are the
evils. Since of them surely who do right no one inquires about these
things, of them that are purposed to live equitably and temperately;
but they, who dare to commit wicked acts, and wish to devise some
foolish comfort<note n="2296" id="iii.LVI-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p38"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVI-p38.1">παραμυθαν</span>,

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p39">But let us tear these in pieces not by our words only,
but by our deeds too. For neither are these things of necessity. For if
they were of necessity, He would not have said, “Woe to the man,

“If thy hand, or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast
them from thee: for it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
maimed, rather than having two hands or feet to be cast into the fire.

relations, whom we regard in the rank of necessary members. This He had
both said further back, and now He saith it. For nothing is so hurtful
as bad company. For what things compulsion cannot, friendship can often
effect, both for hurt, and for profit. Wherefore with much earnestness
He commands us to cut off them that hurt us, intimating these that
bring the offenses.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p49">Seest thou how He hath put away the mischief that would
result from the offenses? By foretelling that there surely will be
offenses, so that they might find no one in a state of carelessness,
but that looking for them men might be watchful. By showing the evils
to be great (for He would not have said without purpose, “Woe to
the world because of the offenses,” but to show that great is the
mischief therefrom), by lamenting again in stronger terms over him that
brings them in. For the saying, “But woe to that man,” was
that of one showing that great was the punishment, but not this only,
but also by the comparison which He added He increased the fear.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p50">Then He is not satisfied with these things, but He
showeth also the way, by which one may avoid the offenses.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p51">But what is this? The wicked, saith He, though they be
exceeding dear friends to thee, cut off from thy friendship.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p52">And He giveth a reason that cannot be gainsaid. For if
they continue friends, thou wilt not gain them, but thou wilt lose
thyself besides; but if thou shouldest cut them off, thine own
salvation at least thou wilt gain. So that if any one’s
friendship harms thee, cut it off from thee. For if of our own members
we often cut off many, when they are both in an incurable state, and
are ruining the rest, much more ought one to do this in the case of
friends.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p53">But if evils were by nature, superfluous were all this
admonition and advice, superfluous the precaution by the means that
have been mentioned. But if it be not superfluous, as surely it is not
superfluous, it is quite clear that wickedness is of the will.<note n="2304" id="iii.LVI-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p54"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVI-p54.1">γνμη</span>.</p></note>

imagination of the multitude are so esteemed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p58">And He speaks not of many only, but even of one, even by
this again warding off the hurt of the many offenses. For even as to
flee the wicked, so also to honor the good, hath very great gain, and

out the friendships with them that offend, the other from regarding
these saints with respect and honor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p59">Then in another way also He makes them objects of
reverence, saying, “That their angels do always behold the face

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p60">Hence it is evident, that the saints have angels, or

rather of angels that are greater than others. But when He saith,

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p67">Again, He is putting another reason stronger than the
former, and connects with it a parable, by which He brings in the
Father also as desiring these things. “For how think ye?”
saith He; “If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? And if so be that he
find it,<note n="2310" id="iii.LVI-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p68">[“Verily I say unto you,” omitted.]</p></note>he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine, which went not

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p71">Seest thou by how many things He is urging to the care
of our mean brethren. Say not then, “Such a one is a blacksmith,
a shoemaker, he is a ploughman, he is a fool,” and so despise
him. For in order that thou shouldest not feel this, see by how many
motives He persuades thee to practise moderation, and presses thee into
a care for these. He set a little child, and saith, “Be ye as
little children.” And, “Whosoever receiveth such a little
child receiveth me;” and, “Whosoever shall offend,”
shall suffer the utmost penalties. And He was not even satisfied with
the comparison of the “millstone,” but added also His
“woe,” and commanded us to cut off such, though they be in
the place of hands and eyes to us. And by the angels again that are
entrusted with these same mean brethren, He makes them objects of
veneration, and from His own will and passion (for when He said,
“The Son of Man is come to save that which was lost,” He
signifies even the cross, like as Paul saith, speaking of a brother,
“For whom Christ died”); and from the Father, for that
neither to Him doth it seem good that one should perish; and from
common custom, because the shepherd leaves them that are safe, and
seeks what is lost; and when he hath found what was gone astray, he is
greatly delighted at the finding and the saving of this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p72">5. If then God thus rejoices over the little one that is
found, how dost thou despise them that are the objects of God’s
earnest care, when one ought to give up even one’s very life for
one of these little ones? But is he weak and mean? Therefore for this
very cause most of all, one ought to do everything in order to preserve
him. For even He Himself left the ninety and nine sheep, and went after
this, and the safety of so many availed not to throw into the shade the
loss of one. But Luke saith, that He even brought it on his shoulders,
and that “There was greater joy over one sinner that repenteth,
than over ninety and nine just persons.”<note n="2313" id="iii.LVI-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p73"><scripRef passage="Luke xv. 7" id="iii.LVI-p73.1" parsed="|Luke|15|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.15.7">Luke xv.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> And from His forsaking those that were saved for it, and from His
taking more pleasure in this one, He showed His earnestness about it to
be great.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p74">Let us not then be careless about such souls as these.
For all these things are said for this object. For by threatening, that
he who has not become a little child should not so much as at all set
foot in the Heavens, and speaking of “the millstone,” He
hath brought down the haughtiness of the boastful; for nothing is so
hostile to love as pride; and by saying, “It must needs be that
offenses come,” He made them to be wakeful; and by adding,
“Woe unto him by whom the offense cometh,” He hath caused
each to endeavor that it be not by him. And while by commanding to cut
off them that offend He made salvation easy; by enjoining not to
despise them, and not merely enjoining, but with

<pb n="351" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_351.html" id="iii.LVI-Page_351" />

earnestness (for “take heed,” saith
He, “that ye despise not one of these little ones”), and by
saying, “Their angels behold the face of my Father,” and,
“For this end am I come,” and “my Father willeth
this,” He hath made those who should take care of them more
diligent.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p75">Seest thou what a wall He hath set around them, and what
earnest care He taketh of them that are contemptible and perishing, at
once threatening incurable ills to them that make them fall, and
promising great blessings to them that wait upon them, and take care of
them, and bringing an example from Himself again and from the
Father?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p76">Him let us also imitate, refusing none of the tasks that
seem lowly and troublesome for our brethren’s sake; but though we
have to do service, though he be small, though he be mean for whom this
is done, though the work be laborious, though we must pass over
mountains and precipices, let all things be held endurable for the
salvation of our brother. For a soul is an object of such earnest care
to God, that “He spared not His own Son.”<note n="2314" id="iii.LVI-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p77"><scripRef passage="Rom. viii. 32" id="iii.LVI-p77.1" parsed="|Rom|8|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.32">Rom. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p78">Wherefore I entreat, when morning hath appeared,
straightway as we come out of our house, let us have this one object in
view, this earnest care above all, to rescue him that is in danger; I
do not mean this danger only that is known by sense, for this is not
danger at all, but the danger of the soul, that which is brought upon
men by the devil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p79">For the merchant too, to increase his wealth, crosses
the sea; and the artisan, to add to his substance, doeth all things.
Let us also then not be satisfied with our own salvation only, since
else we destroy even this. For in a war too, and in an engagement, the
soldier who is looking to this only how he may save himself by flight,
destroys the rest also with himself; much as on the other hand the
noble-minded one, and he who stands in arms in defense of the others,
with the others preserves himself also. Since then our state too is a
war, and of all wars the bitterest, and an engagement and a battle,
even as our King commanded us, so let us set ourselves in array in the
engagement, prepared for slaughter, and blood, and murders, looking to
salvation in behalf of all, and cheering them that stand, and raising
up them that are down. For indeed many of our brethren lie fallen in
this conflict, having wounds, wallowing in blood, and there is none to
heal, not any one of the people, not a priest, no one else, no one to
stand by, no friend, no brother, but we look every man to his own
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p80">By reason of this we maim our own interests also. For
the greatest confidence and means of approval is the not looking to our
own things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p81">Therefore I say, are we weak and easy to be overcome
both by men, and by the devil, because we seek the opposite to this,
and lock not our shields one with another, neither are fortified with
godly love, but seek for ourselves other motives of friendship, some
from relationship, some from long acquaintance, some from community of
interest, some from neighborhood; and from every cause rather are we
friends, than from godliness, when one’s friendships ought to be
formed upon this only. But now the contrary is done; with Jews and with
Greeks<note n="2315" id="iii.LVI-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p82"><i>i.e.</i>Heathens.</p></note>we sometimes become friends, rather than with the children of the
church.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p83">6. Yes, saith he, because the one is worthless, but the
other kind and gentle. What sayest thou? Dost thou call thy brother
worthless, who art commanded not to call him so much as Raca? And art
thou not ashamed, neither dost thou blush, at exposing thy brother, thy
fellow member, him that hath shared in the same birth with thee, that
hath partaken of the same table?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p84">But if thou hast any brother after the flesh, if he
should perpetrate ten thousand evil deeds, thou laborest to conceal
him, and accountest thyself also to partake of the shame, when he is
disgraced; but as to thy spiritual brother, when thou oughtest to free
him from calumny, thou dost rather encompass him with ten thousand
charges against him?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p85">“Why he is worthless and insufferable,” thou
mayest say. Nay then for this reason become his friend, that thou
mayest put an end to his being such a one, that thou mayest convert
him, that thou mayest lead him back to virtue.—“But he
obeys not,” thou wilt say, “neither doth he bear
advice.”—Whence knowest thou it? What, hast thou admonished
him, and attempted to amend him?—“I have admonished him
often,” thou wilt say. How many times?—Oftentimes, both
once, and a second time.—Oh! Is this often? Why, if thou hadst
done this throughout all the time, oughtest thou to grow weary, and to
give it up? Seest thou not how God is always admonishing us, by the
prophets, by the apostles, by the evangelists? What then? have we
performed all? and have we been obedient in all things? By no means.
Did He then cease admonishing?

<pb n="352" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_352.html" id="iii.LVI-Page_352" />

Did
He hold His peace? Doth He not say each day, “Ye cannot serve
God, and mammon”<note n="2316" id="iii.LVI-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p86"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 24" id="iii.LVI-p86.1" parsed="|Matt|6|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.24">Matt. vi.

forgiveness,”<note n="2317" id="iii.LVI-p86.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p87"><scripRef passage="Luke vi. 37" id="iii.LVI-p87.1" parsed="|Luke|6|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.6.37">Luke vi.
37</scripRef>.</p></note>and we become wild beasts more and more? Doth He not continually
admonish to restrain desire, and to keep the mastery over wicked lust,
and many wallow worse than swine in this sin? But nevertheless, He
ceases not speaking.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p88">Wherefore then do we not consider these things with
ourselves, and say that even with us God reasons, and abstains not from
doing this, although we disobey Him in many things?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p89">Therefore He said that, “Few are the
saved.”<note n="2318" id="iii.LVI-p89.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p90">See <scripRef passage="Luke xiii. 23" id="iii.LVI-p90.1" parsed="|Luke|13|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.13.23">Luke

take with us others too when we depart; when we have saved neither
ourselves, nor others, what shall we suffer? Whence shall we have any
more a hope of salvation?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p91">But why do I blame for these things, when not even of
them that dwell with us do we take any account, of wife, and children,
and servants, but we have care of one thing instead of another, like
drunken men, that our servants may be more in number, and may serve us
with much diligence, and that our children may receive from us a large
inheritance, and that our wife may have ornaments of gold, and costly
garments, and wealth; and we care not at all for themselves, but for
the things that belong to them. For neither do we care for our own
wife, nor provide for her, but for the things that belong to the wife;
neither for the child, but for the things of the child.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p92">And we do the same as if any one seeing a house in a bad
state, and the walls giving way, were to neglect to raise up these, and
to make up great fences round it without; or when a body was diseased,
were not to take care of this, but were to weave for it gilded
garments; or when the mistress was ill, were to give heed to the
maidservants, and the looms, and the vessels in the house, and mind
other things, leaving her to lie and moan.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p93">For this is done even now, and when our soul is in evil
and wretched case, and angry, and reviling, and lusting wrongly, and
full of vainglory, and at strife, and dragged down to the earth, and
torn by so many wild beasts, we neglect to drive away the passions from
her, and are careful about house and servants. And while if a bear has
escaped by stealth, we shut up our houses, and run along by the narrow
passages, so as not to fall in with the wild beast; now while not one
wild beast, but many such thoughts are tearing in pieces the soul, we
have not so much as a feeling of it. And in the city we take so much
care, as to shut up the wild beasts in solitary places and in cages,
and neither at the senate house of the city, nor at the courts of
justice, nor at the king’s palace, but far off somewhere at a
distance do we keep them chained; but in the case of the soul, where
the senate house is, where the King’s palace, where the court of
justice is, the wild beasts are let loose, crying and making a tumult
about the mind itself and the royal throne. Therefore all things are
turned upside down, and all is full of disturbance, the things within,
the things without, and we are in nothing different from a city thrown
into confusion from being overrun by barbarians; and what takes place
in us is as though a serpent were setting on a brood of sparrows, and
the sparrows, with their feeble cries, were flying about every way
affrighted, and full of trouble, without having any place whither to go
and end their consternation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p94">7. Wherefore I entreat, let us kill the serpent, let us
shut up the wild beasts, let us stifle them, let us slay them, and
these wicked thoughts let us give over to the sword of the Spirit, lest

that “The wild asses shall dance there, and porcupines, and
serpents.”<note n="2319" id="iii.LVI-p94.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p95"><scripRef passage="Isaiah xiii. 21, 22" id="iii.LVI-p95.1" parsed="|Isa|13|21|13|22" osisRef="Bible:Isa.13.21-Isa.13.22">Isaiah

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p96">For there are, there are even men worse than wild asses,
living as it were in the wilderness, and kicking; yea the more part of
the youth amongst us is like this. For indeed having wild lusts they
thus leap, they kick, going about unbridled, and spend their diligence
on no becoming object.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p97">And the fathers are to blame, who while they constrain
the horsebreakers to discipline their horses with much attention, and
suffer not the youth of the colt to go on long untamed, but put upon it
both a rein, and all the rest, from the beginning; but their own young
ones they overlook, going about for a long season unbridled, and
without temperance; disgracing themselves, by fornications, and
gamings, and continuings in the wicked theatres, when they ought before
fornication to give him to a wife, to a wife chaste, and highly endued
with wisdom; for she will both bring off her husband from his most
disorderly course of life, and will be instead of a rein to the
colt.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p98">For indeed fornications and adulteries come not from any
other cause, than from young men’s being unrestrained. For if he
have a prudent wife, he will take care of house and honor and
character. “But he is young,” you say. I know it too. For
if Isaac was forty years old when he took his bride, passing all that
time of his life in virginity, much more ought young men under grace to
practise this self-restraint. But oh what grief! Ye do not endure to
take care of their chastity, but ye overlook their disgracing, defiling
themselves, becoming accursed; as though ye knew not that the profit of
marriage is to preserve the body pure, and if this be not so, there is
no advantage of marriage. But ye do the contrary; when they are filled
with countless stains, then ye bring them to marriage without purpose
and without fruit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p99">“Why I must wait,” thou wilt say,
“that he may become approved, that he may distinguish himself in
the affairs of the state;” but of the soul ye have no

things are full of confusion, and disorder, and trouble, because this
is made a secondary matter, because necessary things are neglected, but
the unimportant obtain much forethought.</p>

others, and these again to others after them, and they that follow
these to their posterity, becoming rather a kind of passers on of our
possessions and of our money, but not masters.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p102">Hence great is our folly; hence the free are less
esteemed than the slaves. For slaves we reprove, if not for their sake,
yet for our own; but the free enjoy not the benefit even of this care,
but are more vile in our estimation than these slaves. And why do I
say, than our slaves? For our children are less esteemed than cattle;
and we take care of horses and asses rather than of children. And
should one have a mule, great is his anxiety to find the best groom,
and not one either harsh, or dishonest, or drunken, or ignorant of his
art; but if we have set a tutor<note n="2321" id="iii.LVI-p102.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p103"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVI-p103.1">παιδαγωγν</span>, a
man-servant who took care of boys.</p></note>over a child’s soul, we take at once, and at random, whoever
comes in our way. And yet than this art there is not another greater.
For what is equal to training the soul, and forming the mind of one
that is young? For he that hath this art, ought to be more exactly
observant than any painter and any sculptor.<note n="2322" id="iii.LVI-p103.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVI-p104">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVI-p104.1">ἀνδριαντοποιο</span>,

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p105">But we take no account of this, but look to one thing
only, that he may be trained as to his tongue. And to this again we
have directed our endeavors for money’s sake. For not that he may
be able to speak, but that he may get money, does he learn speaking;
since if it were possible to grow rich even without this, we should
have no care even for this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p106">Seest thou how great is the tyranny of riches? how it
has seized upon all things, and having bound them like some slaves or
cattle, drags them where it will?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p107">But what are we advantaged by such accusations against
it? For we indeed shoot at it in words, but it prevails over us in
deeds. Nevertheless, not even so shall we cease to shoot at it with
words from our tongue. For if any advance is made, both we are gainers
and you; but if you continue in the same things, all our part at least
hath been performed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVI-p108">But may God both deliver you from this disease, and
cause us to glory in you, for to Him be glory, and dominion, world
without end. Amen.</p>

thy brother.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.LVII-p6"><span class="c11" id="iii.LVII-p6.1">For</span>, since He had used vehement
language against them that cause offense, and on every hand had moved
them to fear; in order that the offended might not in this way on the
other hand become supine, neither supposing all to be cast upon others,
should be led on to another vice, soften in themselves, and desiring to
be humored in everything, and run upon the shoal of pride; seest thou
how He again checks them also, and commands the telling of the faults
to be between the two alone, lest by the testimony of the many he
should render his accusation heavier, and the other, become excited to
opposition, should continue incorrigible.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p7">Wherefore He saith, “Between thee and him
alone,” and, “If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
brother.” What is, “If he shall hear thee?” If he
shall condemn himself, if he shall be persuaded that he has done
wrong.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p8">“Thou hast gained thy brother.” He did not
say, Thou hast a sufficient revenge, but, “Thou hast gained thy
brother,” to show that there is a common loss from the enmity.
For He said not, “He hath gained himself only,” but,
“thou too hast gained him,” whereby He showed that both the
one and the other were losers before this, the one of his brother, the
other of his own salvation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p9">This, when He sat on the mount also, He advised; at one
time bringing him who has given the pain to him that had been pained,
and saying, “Be reconciled to thy brother,”<note n="2325" id="iii.LVII-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 24" id="iii.LVII-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|5|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.24">Matt. v.
24</scripRef>. [But the citation is
fuller: “If thou art standing by the altar and rememberest that
thy brother hath aught against thee, go away, be reconciled,”
etc.—R.]</p></note>and at another commanding him that had been wronged to forgive his
neighbor. For He taught men to say, “Forgive us our debts, like
as we forgive our debtors.”<note n="2326" id="iii.LVII-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p11"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 12" id="iii.LVII-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|6|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.12">Matt. vi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p12">But here He is devising another mode. For not him that
gave the pain, <i>doth He now call upon</i>,<note n="2327" id="iii.LVII-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p13">[Supplied by translator.]</p></note>but him that was pained He brings to this one. For because this who
hath done the wrong would not easily come to make excuse, out of shame,
and confusion of face, He draws that other to him, and not merely so,
but in such way as also to correct what hath been done. And He saith
not, “Accuse,” nor “Charge him,” nor
“Demand satisfaction, and an account,” but, “Tell him
of his fault,”<note n="2328" id="iii.LVII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p14">Or, “Convict him.”</p></note>saith He. For he is held in a kind of stupor through anger and shame
with which he is intoxicated; and thou, who art in health, must go thy
way to him that is ill, and make the tribunal private, and the remedy
such as may be readily received. For to say, “Tell him of his
fault,” is nothing else than “Remind him of his
error,” tell him what thou hast suffered at his hand, which very
thing, if it be done as it ought, is the part of one making excuse for
him, and drawing him over earnestly to a reconciliation.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p15">What then, if he should disobey, and be disposed to
abide in hardness? “Take with thyself yet one or two, that in the
mouth of two witnesses every word may be established.”<note n="2329" id="iii.LVII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 16" id="iii.LVII-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|18|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.16">Matt.

for his cure, not in anger and indignation. For the physician in like
manner, when he sees the malady obstinate, doth not give up nor grow
impatient, but then makes the more preparation; which He commands us to
do in this case too.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p17">For since thou appearedst to be too weak alone, make
thyself more powerful by this addition. For surely the two are
sufficient to convict him that hath sinned. Seest thou how He seeketh
not the good of him that hath been pained only, but of him also that
hath given the pain. For the person injured is this one who is taken
captive by his passion, he it is that is diseased, and weak, and
infirm. Wherefore He often sends the other to this one, now alone, and
now with others; but if he continue in it, even with the church. For,
“Tell it,” saith He, “to the Church.”<note n="2330" id="iii.LVII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 17" id="iii.LVII-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|18|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.17">Matt.

For if He were seeking this
one’s advantage only, He would not have commanded to pardon,
seventy times seven, one repenting. He would not so often have set so
many over him to correct his passion; but if he had remained
incorrigible after the first conference would have let him be; but now
once, and twice, and thrice, He commands to attempt his cure, and now
alone and now with two, now with more.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p19">Wherefore, with respect to them that are without He
saith no such thing, but, “If any one smite thee,” He
saith, “on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also,”<note n="2331" id="iii.LVII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 39" id="iii.LVII-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|5|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.39">Matt. v.

12</scripRef>.</p></note>but the brethren he commands both to tell of their faults, and to avoid
them, and to cut them off, not being obedient, that they may be
ashamed; this Himself also doeth here, making these laws about the
brethren; and He sets three<note n="2333" id="iii.LVII-p21.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p22">[Oxford edition, “these,” misprint,
since the Greek word is <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVII-p22.1">τρε</span>.—R.]</p></note>over him for teachers and judges, to teach him the things that are done
at the time of his drunkenness. For though it be himself that hath said
and done all those unreasonable things, yet he will need others to
teach him this, like as the drunken man. For anger and sin is a more
frantic thing<note n="2334" id="iii.LVII-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p23"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVII-p23.1">ἐκστατικτερον</span>.</p></note>than any drunkenness, and puts the soul in greater distraction.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p24">Who, for instance, was wiser than David? Yet for all
that, when he had sinned he perceived it not, his lust keeping in
subjection all his reasoning powers, and like some smoke filling his
soul. Therefore he stood in need of a lantern from the prophet, and of
words calling to his mind what he had done. Wherefore here also He
brings these to him that hath sinned, to reason with him about the
things he had done.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p25">2. But for what reason doth He command this one to tell
him of his fault, and not another? Because this man he would endure
more quietly, this, who hath been wronged, who hath been pained, who
hath been despitefully used. For one doth not bear in the same way
being told by another of one’s fault concerning him that hath
been insulted, as by the insulted person himself, especially when this
person is alone convicting him. For when he who should demand justice
against him, even this one appears to be caring for his salvation, this
will have more power than anything in the world to shame him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p26">Seest thou how this is done not for the sake of just
punishment, but of amendment? Therefore He doth not at once command to
take with him the two, but when himself hath failed; and not even then
doth He send forth a multitude against him; but makes the addition no
further than two, or even one; but when he has contemned these too,
then and not till then He brings him out to the church.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p27">So much earnestness doth He show, that our
neighbor’s sins be not exposed by us. And indeed He might have
commanded this from the first, but that this might not be, He did not
command it, but after a first and second admonition He appoints
this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p28">But what is, “In the mouth of two or three
witnesses every word shall be established?” Thou hast a
sufficient testimony. His meaning is, that thou hast done all thy part,
that thou hast left undone none of the things which it pertained to
thee to do.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p29">“But if he shall neglect to hear them also, tell
it to the church,” that is, to the rulers of it; “but if he
neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man and a
publican.” For after this such a one is incurably diseased.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p30">But mark thou, I pray thee, how everywhere He putteth
the publican for an example of the greatest wickedness. For above too
He saith, “Do not even the publicans the same?”<note n="2335" id="iii.LVII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 46" id="iii.LVII-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|5|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.46">Matt. v.

hearken, who are rushing upon unjust gains, who are counting up usuries
upon usuries.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p33">But why did He set him with these? To soothe the person
wronged, and to alarm him. Is this only then the punishment? Nay, but
hear also what follows. “Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
be bound in Heaven.”<note n="2337" id="iii.LVII-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 18" id="iii.LVII-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|18|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.18">Matt.
xviii. 18</scripRef>. [R.V., “What
things soever,” etc. But the singular pronoun is substituted in
the text of the Homily.—R.]</p></note> And He did not say to the ruler of the church, “Bind such a
man,” but, “If thou bind,” committing the whole
matter to the person himself, who is aggrieved, and the bonds abide
indissoluble. Therefore he will suffer the utmost ills; but not he who
hath brought him to account is to blame, but he who hath not been
willing to be persuaded.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p35">Seest thou how He hath bound him down with twofold
constraint, both by the vengeance here, and by the punishment
hereafter? But these things hath He threatened, that these
circumstances may not arise, but that fearing, at once the being cast
out of the

<pb n="356" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_356.html" id="iii.LVII-Page_356" />

church, and the danger
from the bond, and the being bound in Heaven, he may become more
gentle. And knowing these things, if not at the beginning, at any rate
in the multitude of the tribunals he will put off his anger. Wherefore,
I tell you, He hath set over him a first, and a second, and a third
court,<note n="2338" id="iii.LVII-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p36">[A clause is omitted here, “and doth not
straightway cut him off.”—R.]</p></note>so that though he should neglect to hear the first, he may yield to the
second; and even if he should reject that, he may fear the third; and
though he should make no account of this, he may be dismayed at the
vengeance to come, and at the sentence and judgment to proceed from
God.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p37">“And again I say unto you, that if two of you
shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall
be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven. For where two or
three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of
them.”<note n="2339" id="iii.LVII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 19, 20" id="iii.LVII-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|18|19|18|20" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.19-Matt.18.20">Matt.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p39">Seest thou how by another motive also He puts down our
enmities, and takes away our petty dissensions,<note n="2340" id="iii.LVII-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p40"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVII-p40.1">μικροψυχα</span>
.</p></note>and draws us one to another, and this not from the punishment only
which hath been mentioned, but also from the good things which spring
from charity? For having denounced those threats against
contentiousness, He putteth here the great rewards of concord, if at
least they who are of one accord do even prevail with the Father, as
touching the things they ask, and have Christ in the midst of them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p41">“Are there then indeed nowhere two of one
accord?” Nay, in many places, perchance even everywhere.
“How then do they not obtain all things?” Because many are
causes of their failing. For either they often ask things inexpedient.
And why marvellest thou, if this is the case with some others, whereas
it was so even with Paul, when he heard, “My grace is sufficient
for thee; for my strength is perfected in weakness.”<note n="2341" id="iii.LVII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p42"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 9" id="iii.LVII-p42.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9">2 Cor. xii.

and contribute not their own part, but He seeks for such as are like
them; therefore He saith “of you,” of the virtuous, of them
that show forth an angelic rule of life.<note n="2342" id="iii.LVII-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p43"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVII-p43.1">πολιτεαν</span>.</p></note> Or they pray against them that have aggrieved them, seeking for redress
and vengeance; and this kind of thing is forbidden, for,
“Pray,” saith He, “for your enemies.”<note n="2343" id="iii.LVII-p43.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p44"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 44" id="iii.LVII-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|5|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.44">Matt. v.
44</scripRef>.</p></note> Or having sins unrepented they ask mercy, which thing it is impossible
to receive, not only if themselves ask it, but although others having
much confidence towards God entreat for them, like as even Jeremiah
praying for the Jews did hear, “Pray not thou for this people,
because I will not hear thee.”<note n="2344" id="iii.LVII-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p45"><scripRef passage="Jer. xi. 14" id="iii.LVII-p45.1" parsed="|Jer|11|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.11.14">Jer. xi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p46">But if all things are there, and thou ask things
expedient, and contribute all thine own part, and exhibit an
apostolical life, and have concord and love towards thy neighbor, thou
wilt obtain on thy entreaty; for the Lord is loving towards man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p47">3. Then because He had said, “Of my Father,”
in order that He might show that it is Himself that giveth, and not He
who begat Him only, He added, “For wheresoever two or three are
gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of
them.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p48">What then? are there not two or three gathered together
in His name? There are indeed, but rarely. For not merely of the
assembling doth He speak, neither this doth He require only; but most
surely, as I said before also, the rest of virtue too together with
this, and besides, even this itself He requires with great strictness.
For what He saith is like this, “If any holds me the principal
ground of his love to his neighbors, I will be with Him, if he be a
virtuous man in other respects.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p49">But now we see the more part having other motives of
friendship. For one loves, because he is loved, another because he hath
been honored, a third because such a one has been useful to him in some
other worldly matter, a fourth for some other like cause; but for
Christ’s sake it is a difficult thing to find any one loving his
neighbor sincerely, and as he ought to love him. For the more part are
bound one to another by their worldly affairs. But Paul did not love
thus, but for Christ’s sake; wherefore even when not loved in
such wise as he loved, he did not cease his love, because he had
planted a strong root of his affection; but not so our present state,
but on inquiry we shall find with most men anything likely to produce
friendship rather than this. And if any one bestowed on me power in so
great a multitude to make this inquiry, I would show the more part
bound one to another by worldly motives.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p50">And this is evident from the causes that work enmity.
For because they are bound one to another by these temporal<note n="2345" id="iii.LVII-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p51"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVII-p51.1">ἐπικηρων</span>.</p></note>motives, therefore they are neither fervent towards one another, nor
constant, but insult, and loss of money, and envy, and love of
vainglory, and every such thing coming upon them, severs the love-tie.
For it finds not the root spiritual. Since if indeed it were

<pb n="357" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_357.html" id="iii.LVII-Page_357" />

such, no worldly thing would dissolve
things spiritual. For love for Christ’s sake is firm, and not to
be broken, and impregnable, and nothing can tear it asunder; not
calumnies, not dangers, not death, no other thing of this kind. For
though he suffer ten thousand things, who thus loves; looking to the
ground of his love, he will not desist. For he who loves because of
being loved, should he meet with anything painful, puts an end to his
love; but he who is bound by this, will never desist.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p52">Wherefore Paul also said, “Charity never
faileth.”<note n="2346" id="iii.LVII-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVII-p53"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 8" id="iii.LVII-p53.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.8">1 Cor.
xiii. 8</scripRef>. [R.V., “Love
never faileth.” The Greek word is rendered “love”
throughout this part of the Homily.—R.]</p></note> For what hast thou to say? That when honored he insults? that receiving
benefits he was minded to slay thee? But even this works upon thee to
love more, if thou lovest for Christ’s sake. For what things are
in the rest subversive of love, these here become apt to produce it.
How? First, because such a one is to thee a cause of rewards; secondly,
because he that is so disposed stands in need of more succor, and much
attention. Therefore I say, he who thus loves inquires not about race,
nor country, nor wealth, nor his love to himself, nor any other such
matter, but though he be hated, though he be insulted, though he be
slain, continues to love, having as a sufficient ground for love,
Christ; wherefore also he stands steadfast, firm, not to be overthrown,
looking unto Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVII-p54">For Christ too so loved his enemies, having loved the
obstinate, the injurious, the blasphemers, them that hated Him, them
that would not so much as see Him; them that were preferring wood and

<p class="c12" id="iii.LVIII-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.LVIII-p5.1">Peter</span> supposed he was saying
something great, wherefore also as aiming at greatness he added,
“Until seven times?” For this thing, saith he, which Thou
hast commanded to do, how often shall I do? For if he forever sins, but
forever when reproved repents, how often dost thou command us to bear
with this man? For with regard to that other who repents not, neither
acknowledges his own faults, Thou hast set a limit, by saying,
“Let him be to thee as the heathen and the publican;” but
to this no longer so, but Thou hast commanded to accept him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p6">How often then ought I to bear with him, being told his
faults, and repenting? Is it enough for seven times?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p7">What then saith Christ, the good God, who is loving
towards man? “I say not unto thee, until seven times, but, until
seventy times seven,” not setting a number here, but what is
infinite and perpetual and forever. For even as ten thousand times
signifies

often, so here too. For
by saying, “The barren hath borne seven,”<note n="2350" id="iii.LVIII-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p8"><scripRef passage="1 Sam. ii. 5" id="iii.LVIII-p8.1" parsed="|1Sam|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.2.5">1 Sam. ii.

by a number, but hath declared that it is to be perpetual and
forever.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p9">This at least He indicated by the parable that is put
after. For that He might not seem to any to enjoin great things and
hard to bear, by saying, “Seventy times seven,” He added
this parable, at once both leading them on to what He had said, and
putting down him who was priding himself upon this, and showing the act
was not grievous, but rather very easy. Therefore let me add, He
brought forward His own love to man, that by the comparison, as He
saith, thou mightest learn, that though thou forgive seventy times
seven, though thou continually pardon thy neighbor for absolutely all
his sins, as a drop of water to an endless sea, so much, or rather much
more, doth thy love to man come short in comparison of the boundless
goodness of God, of which thou standest in need, for that thou art to
be judged, and to give an account.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p10">Wherefore also He went on to say, “The Kingdom of
Heaven is likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his
servants.<note n="2351" id="iii.LVIII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p11">[R.V., “make a reckoning.”]</p></note> And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed

that he had.”<note n="2353" id="iii.LVIII-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p13"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 23-25" id="iii.LVIII-p13.1" parsed="|Matt|18|23|18|25" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.23-Matt.18.25">Matt.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p14">Then after this man had enjoyed the benefit of mercy, he

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p16">Seest thou how great the difference between sins against
man and against God? As great as between ten thousand talents, and a
hundred pence, or rather even much more. And this arises both from the
difference of the persons, and the constant succession of our sins. For
when a man looks at us, we stand off and shrink from sinning: but when
God sees us every day, we do not forbear, but do and speak all things
without fear.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p17">But not hereby alone, but also from the benefit and from
the honor of which we have partaken, our sins become more grievous.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p18">And if ye are desirous to learn how our sins against Him
are ten thousand talents, or rather even much more, I will try to show
it briefly. But I fear lest to them that are inclined to wickedness,
and love continually to sin, I should furnish still greater security,
or should drive the meeker sort to despair, and they should repeat that
saying of the disciples, “who can be saved?”<note n="2355" id="iii.LVIII-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p19"><scripRef passage="Matt. 19.25; Mark 10.26" id="iii.LVIII-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|19|25|0|0;|Mark|10|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.25 Bible:Mark.10.26">Matt. xix. 25.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p20">Nevertheless for all that I will speak, that I may make
those that attend more safe, and more meek. For they that are incurably
diseased, and past feeling, even without these words of mine, do not
depart from their own carelessness, and wickedness; and if even from
hence they derive greater occasion for contempt, the fault is not in
what is said, but in their insensibility; since what is said surely is
enough both to restrain those that attend to it, and to prick their
hearts; and the meeker sort, when they see on the one hand the
greatness of their sins, and learn also on the other hand the power of
repentance, will cleave to it the more, wherefore it is needful to
speak.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p21">I will speak then, and will set forth our sins, both
wherein we offend against God, and wherein against men, and I will set
forth not each person’s own, but what are common; but his own let
each one join to them after that from his conscience.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p22">And I will do this, having first set forth the good
deeds of God to us. What then are His good deeds? He created us when we
were not, and made all things for our sakes that are seen, Heaven, sea,
air, all that in them is, living creatures, plants, seeds; for we must
needs speak briefly for the boundless ocean of the works. Into us alone
of all that are on earth He breathed a living soul such as we have, He
planted a garden, He gave a help-meet, He set us over all the brutes,
He crowned us with glory and honor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p23">After that, when man had been unthankful towards his
benefactor, He vouchsafed unto him a greater gift.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p24">2. For look not to this only, that He cast him out of
paradise, but mark also the gain that arose from thence. For after
having cast him out of paradise, and having wrought those countless
good works, and having accomplished His various dispensations, He sent
even His own Son for the sake of them that had been benefited by Him
and were hating Him, and opened Heaven to us, and unfolded paradise
itself, and made us sons, the enemies, the unthankful.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p25">Wherefore it were even seasonable now to say, “O
the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God!”<note n="2356" id="iii.LVIII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p26"><scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 33" id="iii.LVIII-p26.1" parsed="|Rom|11|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.33">Rom. xi.

mission of sins, and a deliverance from
vengeance, and an inheritance of a kingdom, and He promised numberless
good things on our doing what is right, and stretched forth His hand,
and shed abroad His Spirit into our hearts.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p28">What then? After so many and such great blessings, what
ought to be our disposition; should we indeed, even if each day we died
for Him who so loves us, make due recompense, or rather should we repay
the smallest portion of the debt? By no means, for moreover even this
again is turned to our advantage.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p29">How then are we disposed, whose disposition ought to be
like this? Each day we insult His law. But be ye not angry, if I let
loose my tongue against them that sin, for not you only will I accuse,
but myself also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p30">Where then would ye that I should begin? With the
slaves, or with the free? with them that serve in the army, or with
private persons? with the rulers, or with the subjects? with the women,
or with the men? with the aged men, or with the young? with what age?
with what race? with what rank? with what pursuit?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p31">Would ye then that I should make the beginning with them
that serve as soldiers? What sin then do not these commit every day,
insulting, reviling, frantic, making a gain of other men’s
calamities, being like wolves, never clear from offenses, unless one
might say the sea too was without waves. What passion doth not trouble
them? what disease doth not lay siege to their soul?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p32">For to their equals they show a jealous disposition, and
they envy, and seek after vainglory; and to those that are subject to
them, their disposition is covetous; but to them that have suits, and
run unto them as to a harbor, their conduct is that of enemies and
perjured persons. How many robberies are there with them! How many
frauds! How many false accusations, and meannesses! how many servile
flatteries!</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p33">Come then, let us apply in each case the law of Christ.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p37">But these even study haughtiness, becoming towards them
that are subject to them, and are delivered into their hands, and who
tremble at them, and are afraid of them, more fierce than a wild beast;
for Christ’s sake doing nothing, but all things for the belly,
for money, for vainglory.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p38">Can one indeed reckon up in words the trespass of their
actions? What should one say of their decisions, their laughter, their
unseasonable discourses, their filthy language? But about covetousness
one cannot so much as speak. For like as the monks on the mountains
know not even what covetousness is, so neither do these; but in an
opposite way to them. For they indeed, because of being far removed
from the disease, know not the passion, but these, by reason of being
exceedingly intoxicated with it, have not so much as a perception how
great the evil is. For this vice hath so thrust aside virtue and
tyrannises, that it is not accounted so much as a heavy charge with
those madmen.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p39">But will ye, that we leave these, and go to others of a
gentler kind? Come then, let us examine the race of workmen and
artisans. For these above all seem to live by honest labors, and the
sweat of their own brow. But these too, when they do not take heed to
themselves, gather to themselves many evils from hence. For the
dishonesty that arises from buying and selling they bring into the work
of honest labor, and add oaths, and perjuries, and falsehoods to their
covetousness often, and are taken up with worldly things only, and
continue riveted to the earth; and while they do all things that they
may get money, they do not take much heed that they may impart to the
needy, being always desirous to increase their goods. What should one
say of the revilings that are uttered touching such matters, the
insults, the loans, the usurious gains, the bargains full of much mean
trafficking, the shameless buyings and sellings.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p40">3. But will ye that we leave these too, and go to others
who seem to be more just? Who then are they? They that are possessed of
lands, and reap the wealth that springs from the earth. And what can be
more unjust than these? For if any one were to examine how they treat
their wretched and toil-worn laborers, he will see them to be more
cruel than savages. For upon them that are pining with hunger, and
toiling throughout all their life, they both impose constant and
intolerable payments, and lay on them laborious burdens, and like asses
or mules, or rather like stones, do they treat their bodies, allowing
them not so much as to draw breath a little, and when the earth yields,
and when it doth not yield, they alike wear them out, and grant them no
indulgence. And what can be more pitiable than this, when after

<pb n="360" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_360.html" id="iii.LVIII-Page_360" />

having labored throughout the whole
winter, and being consumed with frost and rain, and watchings, they go
away with their hands empty, yea moreover in debt, and fearing and
dreading more that this famine and shipwreck, the torments of the
overlookers,<note n="2360" id="iii.LVIII-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p41">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVIII-p41.1">ἐπιτρπων</span>,

the worst sense.—R.]</p></note>and their dragging them about, and their demands, and their
imprisonments, and the services from which no entreaty can deliver
them!</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p42">Why should one speak of the merchandise which they make
of them, the sordid gains which they gain by them, by their labors and
their sweat filling winepresses, and wine vats, but not suffering them
to take home so much as a small measure, but draining off the entire
fruits into the casks of their wickedness, and flinging to them for
this a little money?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p43">And new kinds of usuries also do they devise, and not
lawful even according to the laws of the heathens, and they frame
contracts for loans full of many a curse. For not the hundredth part of
the sum, but the half of the sum they press for and exact; and this
when he of whom it is exacted has a wife, is bringing up children, is a
human being, and is filling their threshing floor, and their wine-press
by his own toils.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p44">But none of these things do they consider. Wherefore now
it were seasonable to bring forward the prophet and say, “Be

in leather, and after his preaching practised his craft, and David was
a king, and Job enjoyed the possession of land and of large revenues,
and there was no hindrance hereby to any of these in the way of
virtue.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p49">Bearing in mind all these things, and considering the
ten thousand talents, let us at least hence hasten to remit to our
neighbors their few and trifling debts. For we too have an account to
give of the commandments wherewith we have been trusted, and we are not
able to pay all, no not whatever we may do. Therefore God hath given us
a way to repayment both ready and easy, and which is able to cancel all
these things, I mean, not to be revengeful.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p50">In order then that we may learn this well, let us hear
the whole parable, going on regularly through it. “For there was
brought unto Him,” it saith, “one which owed ten thousand
talents, and when he had not to pay, He commanded him to be sold, and
his wife, and his children.” Wherefore, I pray thee? Not of
cruelty, nor of inhumanity (for the loss came back again upon himself,
for she too was a slave), but of unspeakable tenderness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p51">For it is His purpose to alarm him by this threat, that
He might bring him to supplication, not that he should be sold. For if
He had done it for this intent, He would not have consented to his
request, neither would He have granted the favor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p52">Wherefore then did He not do this, nor forgive the debt
before the account? Desiring to teach him, from how many obligations He
is delivering him, that in this way at least he might become more mild
towards his fellow servant. For even if when he had learnt the weight
of his debt, and the greatness of the forgiveness, he continued taking
his fellow-servant by the throat; if He had not disciplined him
beforehand with such medicines, to what length of cruelty might he not
have gone?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p53">What then saith the other? “Have patience with me,
and I will pay thee all. And his Lord<note n="2364" id="iii.LVIII-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p54">[“The lord of that servant,” according
to our authorities; the Homily varies.—R.]</p></note>was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the
debt.”<note n="2365" id="iii.LVIII-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p55"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 26, 27" id="iii.LVIII-p55.1" parsed="|Matt|18|26|18|27" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.26-Matt.18.27">Matt.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p56">Seest thou again surpassing benevolence? The servant
asked only for delay and putting off the time, but He gave more than he
asked, remission and forgiveness of the entire debt. For it had been
his will to give it even from the first, but he did not desire the gift
to be his only, but also to come of this man’s entreaty, that he
might not go away uncrowned. For that the whole was of him, although
this other fell down to him and prayed, the motive of the forgiveness
showed, for “moved with compassion” he forgave him. But
still even so he willed that other also to seem to contribute
something, that he might not be exceedingly covered with shame, and
that he being schooled in his own calamities, might be indulgent to his
fellow-servant.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p57">4. Up to this point then this man was good and
acceptable; for he confessed, and promised to pay the debt, and fell
down before him, and entreated, and condemned his own sins, and knew
the greatness of the debt. But the sequel is unworthy of his former
deeds. For going out straightway, not after a long time but

wild beast, seizing his fellow-servant by the throat.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p64">What doest thou, O man? perceivest thou not, thou art
making the demand upon thyself, thou an thrusting the sword into
thyself, and revoking the sentence and the gift? But none of these
things did he consider, neither did he remember his own state, neither
did he yield; although the entreaty was not for equal objects.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p65">For the one besought for ten thousand talents, the other
for a hundred pence; the one his fellow-servant, the other his lord;
the one received entire forgiveness, the other asked for delay, and not
so much as this did he give him, for “he cast him into
prison.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p66">“But when his fellow-servants saw it, they accused
him to their lord.” Not even to men is this well-pleasing, much
less to God. They therefore who did not owe, partook of the grief.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p67">What then saith their lord? “O thou wicked
servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst<note n="2369" id="iii.LVIII-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p68">[R.V., “besoughtest.”]</p></note>me; shouldest not thou also have had compassion, even as I had pity on
thee?”<note n="2370" id="iii.LVIII-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p69"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 32" id="iii.LVIII-p69.1" parsed="|Matt|18|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.32">Matt.
xviii. 32</scripRef>. [R.V., “have
had mercy on thy fellow servant, even as I had mercy on thee.”
The verb is the same in both clauses. “On thy fellow
servant,” omitted here, is inserted in the comment.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p70">See again the lord’s gentleness. He pleads with
him, and excuses himself, being on the point of revoking his gift; or
rather, it was not he that revoked it, but the one who had received it.
Wherefore He saith, “I forgave thee all that debt, because thou
desiredst me; shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellow-servant?” For even if the thing doth seem to thee hard;
yet shouldest thou have looked to the gain, which hath been, which is
to be. Even if the injunction be galling, thou oughtest to consider the
reward; neither that he hath grieved thee, but that thou hast provoked
God, whom by mere prayer thou hast reconciled. But if even so it be a
galling thing to thee to become friends with him who hath grieved thee,
to fall into hell is far more grievous; and if thou hadst set this
against that, then thou wouldest have known that to forgive is a much
lighter thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p71">And whereas, when he owed ten thousand talents, he
called him not wicked, neither reproached him, but showed mercy on him;
when he had become harsh to his fellow-servant, then he saith, “O
thou wicked servant.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p72">Let us hearken, the covetous, for even to us is the word
spoken. Let us hearken also, the merciless, and the cruel, for not to
others are we cruel, but to ourselves. When then thou art minded to be
revengeful, consider that against thyself art thou revengeful, not
against another; that thou art binding up thine own sins, not thy
neighbors. For as to thee, whatsoever thou mayest do to this man, thou
doest as a man and in the present life, but God not so, but more
mightily will He take vengeance on thee, and with the vengeance
hereafter.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p73">“For He delivered him over till he should pay that
which was due,” that is, for ever; for he will never repay. For
since thou art not become better by the kindness shown thee, it remains
that by vengeance thou be corrected.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p74">And yet, “The graces and the gifts are without
repentance,”<note n="2371" id="iii.LVIII-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p75"><scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 29" id="iii.LVIII-p75.1" parsed="|Rom|11|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.29">Rom. xi.
29</scripRef>. [Freely cited.]</p></note>but wickedness has had such power as to set aside even this law. What
then can be a more grievous thing than to be revengeful, when it
appears to overthrow such and so great a gift of God.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p76">And he did not merely “deliver” him, but
“was wroth.” For when he commanded him to be sold, his were
not the words of wrath (therefore neither did he do it), but a very
great occasion for benevolence; but now the sentence is of much
indignation, and vengeance, and punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p77">What then means the parable? “So likewise shall my
Father do also unto you,” He saith, “if ye from your hearts
forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.”<note n="2372" id="iii.LVIII-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p78"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 35" id="iii.LVIII-p78.1" parsed="|Matt|18|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.35">Matt.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p79">He saith not “your Father,” but “my
Father.” For it is not meet for God to be called the Father of
such a one, who is so wicked and malicious.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p80">5. Two things therefore doth He here require, both to
condemn ourselves for our sins, and to forgive others; and the former
for the sake of the latter, that this may become more easy (for he who
considers his own sins is more indulgent to his fellow-servant); and
not merely to forgive with the lips, but from the heart.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p81">Let us not then thrust the sword into ourselves by being
revengeful. For what grief hath he who hath grieved thee inflicted upon
thee, like thou wilt work unto thyself by keeping thine anger in mind,
and drawing upon thyself the sentence from God to condemn thee? For if
indeed thou art watchful, and keepest thyself under control, the evil
will come round upon his head, and it will be he that will suffer harm;
but if thou shouldest continue indignant, and displeased, then thyself
wilt undergo the harm not from him, but from thyself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p82">Say not then that he insulted thee, and slandered thee,
and did unto thee ills beyond number; for the more thou tellest, so
much the more dost thou declare him a benefactor. For he hath given
thee an opportunity to wash away thy sins; so that the greater the
injuries he hath done thee, so much more is he become to thee a cause
of a greater remission of sins.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p83">For if we be willing, no one shall be able to injure us,
but even our enemies shall advantage us in the greatest degree. And why
do I speak of men? For what can be more wicked than the devil; yet
nevertheless, even hence have we a great opportunity of approving
ourselves; and Job showeth it. But if the devil hath become a cause of
crowns, why art thou afraid of a man as an enemy?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p84">See then how much thou gainest, bearing meekly the
spiteful acts of thine enemies. First and greatest, deliverance from
sins; secondly, fortitude and patience; thirdly, mildness and
benevolence; for he that knoweth not how to be angry with them that
grieve him, much more will he be ready to serve them that love him.
Fourthly, to be free from anger continually, to which nothing can be
equal. For of him that is free from anger, it is quite clear that he is
delivered also from the despondency hence arising, and will not spend
his life on vain labors and sorrows. For he that knows not how to hate,
neither doth he know how to grieve, but will enjoy pleasure, and ten
thousand blessings. So that we punish ourselves by hating others, even
as on the other hand we benefit ourselves by loving them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p85">Besides all these things, thou wilt be an object of
veneration even to thy very enemies, though they be devils; or rather,
thou wilt not so much as have an enemy whilst thou art of such a
disposition.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p86">But what is greater than all, and first, thou gainest
the favor of God. Shouldest thou have sinned, thou wilt obtain pardon;
shouldest thou have done what is right, thou wilt obtain a greater
confidence. Let us accomplish therefore the hating no one, that God
also may love us, that, though we be in debt for ten thousand talents,
He may have compassion and pity us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p87">But hast thou been injured by him? Pity him then, do not
hate him; weep and mourn, do not turn away from him. For thou art not
the one that hath offended against God, but he; but thou hast even
approved thyself, if thou endure it. Consider that Christ, when about
to be crucified, rejoiced for Himself, but wept for them that were
crucifying Him. This ought to be our disposition also; and the more we
are injured, so much the more should we lament for them that are
injuring us. For to us many are the benefits hence arising, but to them
the opposites.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p88">But did he insult thee, and strike thee before all? Then
hath he disgraced and dishonored himself before all, and hath opened
the mouths of a thousand accusers, and for thee hath he woven more
crowns, and gathered for thee many to publish thy forbearance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p89">But did he slander thee to others? And what is this? God
is the one that is to demand the account, not they that have heard
this. For to himself hath he added occasion of punishment, so that not
only for his own sins he should give account, but also of what he said
of thee. And upon thee hath he brought evil report with men, but he
himself hath incurred evil report with God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p90">And if these things are not sufficient for thee,
consider that even thy Lord<note n="2373" id="iii.LVIII-p90.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p91"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LVIII-p91.1">Δεσπτη</span>.</p></note>was evil reported of both by Satan and by men, and that to those most
loved by Him; and His Only-Begotten the same again. Wherefore He said,
“If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, much more
shall they call them of His household.”<note n="2374" id="iii.LVIII-p91.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p92"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 25" id="iii.LVIII-p92.1" parsed="|Matt|10|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.25">Matt. x.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p93">And that wicked demon did not only slander Him, but was
also believed, and slandered Him not in ordinary matters, but with the
greatest reproaches and accusations. For he affirmed Him to be
possessed, and to be a deceiver, and an adversary of God.</p>

<pb n="363" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_363.html" id="iii.LVIII-Page_363" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p94">But hast thou also done good, and received evil? Nay, in
respect of this most of all lament and grieve for him that hath done
the wrong, but for thyself rather rejoice, because thou art become like
God, “Who maketh the sun to rise upon evil and good.”<note n="2375" id="iii.LVIII-p94.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LVIII-p95"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 45" id="iii.LVIII-p95.1" parsed="|Matt|5|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.45">Matt. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LVIII-p96">But if to follow God is beyond thee, although to him
that watcheth not even this is hard; yet nevertheless if this seem to
thee to be too great for thee, come let us bring thee to thy
fellow-servants, to Joseph, who suffered countless things, and did good
unto his brethren; to Moses, who after their countless plots against
him, prayed for them; to the blessed Paul, who cannot so much as number
what he suffered from them, and is willing to be accursed for them; to
Stephen, who is stoned, and entreating this sin may be forgiven them.
And having considered all these things, cast away all anger, that God
may forgive us also all our trespasses by the grace and love towards
man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy
Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and always, and world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p7">For neither in the teaching by words doth He continue
always, nor in the wonderful working of signs, but He doeth now one now
the other, variously working the salvation of them that were waiting
upon Him and following Him, so as by the miracles to appear, in what He
said, a Teacher worthy of belief, and by the teaching of His word to
increase the profit from the miracles; and this was to lead them by the
hand to the knowledge of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p8">But do thou mark, I pray thee, this too, how the
disciples pass over whole multitudes with one word, not declaring by
name each of them that are healed. For they said not, that such a one,
and such another, but that many, teaching us to be unostentatious. But
Christ healed, benefiting both them, and by them many others. For the
healing of these men’s infirmity was to others a foundation for
the knowledge of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p9">But not so to the Pharisees, but even for this self-same
thing they become more fierce, and come unto Him tempting Him. For
because they could not lay hold of the works that were doing, they
propose to Him questions. For they “came unto Him, and tempting
Him said, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
cause?”<note n="2377" id="iii.LIX-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 3" id="iii.LIX-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|19|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.3">Matt. xix.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p11">O folly! They thought to silence Him by their questions,
although they had already received certain proof of this power in Him.
When at least they argued much about the Sabbath, when they said,
“He blasphemeth,” when they said, “He hath a
devil,” when they found fault with His disciples as they were
walking in the corn fields, when they argued about unwashen hands, on
every occasion having sewed fast their mouths, and shut up their
shameless tongue, He thus sent them away. Nevertheless, not even so do
they keep off from Him. For such is wickedness, such is envy, shameless
and bold; though it be put to silence ten thousand times, ten thousand
times doth it assault again.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p12">But mark thou, I pray thee, their craft also from the
form of their question. For neither did they say unto Him, Thou didst
command not to put away a wife, for indeed He had already discoursed
about this law; but never

<pb n="364" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_364.html" id="iii.LIX-Page_364" />

theless
they made no mention of those words; but took occasion from hence, and
thinking to make their snare the greater, and being minded to drive Him
to a necessity of contradicting the law, they say not, why didst Thou
enact this or that? but as though nothing had been said, they ask,
“Is it lawful?” expecting that He had forgotten having said
it; and being ready if on the one hand He said, “It is lawful to
put away,” to bring against Him the things He Himself had spoken,
and to say, How then didst Thou affirm the contrary? but if the same
things now again as before, to bring against Him the words of
Moses.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p13">What then said He? He said not,” tempt ye me, ye
hypocrites?” although afterwards He saith this, but here He
speaks not thus. Why can this be? In order that together with His power
He might show forth His gentleness also. For He doth neither always
keep silence, lest they should suppose they are hidden; nor doth He
always reprove, in order that He may instruct us to bear all things
with gentleness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p14">How then doth He answer them? “Have ye not read,
that He which made them at<note n="2378" id="iii.LIX-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p15">[R.V., “from.”]</p></note>the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause
shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his
wife; and they twain shall be<note n="2379" id="iii.LIX-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p16">[R.V., “become.”]</p></note>one flesh? So that they are no more twain but one flesh. What therefore
God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”<note n="2380" id="iii.LIX-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p17"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 4-6" id="iii.LIX-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|19|4|19|6" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.4-Matt.19.6">Matt. xix.
4–6</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p18">See a teacher’s wisdom. I mean, that being asked,
Is it lawful? He did not at once say, It is not lawful, lest they
should be disturbed and put in disorder, but before the decision by His
argument He rendered this manifest, showing that it is itself too the
commandment of His Father, and that not in opposition to Moses did He
enjoin these things, but in full agreement with him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p19">But mark Him arguing strongly not from the creation
only, but also from His command. For He said not, that He made one man
and one woman only, but that He also gave this command that the one man
should be joined to the one woman. But if it had been His will that he
should put this one away, and bring in another, when He had made one
man, He would have formed many women.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p20">But now both by the manner of the creation, and by the
manner of lawgiving, He showed that one man must dwell with one woman
continually, and never break off from her.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p21">And see how He saith, “He which made them at the
beginning, made them male and female,” that is, from one root
they sprung, and into one body came they together, “for the twain
shall be one flesh.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p22">After this, to make it a fearful thing to find fault
with this lawgiving, and to confirm the law, He said not, “Sever
not therefore, nor put asunder,” but, “What God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p23">But if thou put forward Moses, I tell thee of
Moses’ Lord, and together with this, I rely upon the time also.
For God at the beginning made them male and female; and this law is
older (though it seem to have been now introduced by me), and with much
earnestness established. For not merely did He bring the woman to the
man, but also commanded to leave father and mother. And neither did He
make it a law for him merely to come to the woman, but also “to
cleave to her,” by the form of the language intimating that they
might not be severed. And not even with this was He satisfied, but
sought also for another greater union, “for the twain,” He
saith, “shall be one flesh.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p24">Then after He had recited the ancient law, which was
brought in both by deeds and by words, and shown it to be worthy of
respect because of the giver, with authority after that He Himself too
interprets and gives the law, saying, “So that they are no more
twain, but one flesh.” Like then as to sever flesh is a horrible
thing,<note n="2381" id="iii.LIX-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p25"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIX-p25.1">έναγ</span>.</p></note>so also to divorce a wife is unlawful. And He stayed not at this, but
brought in God also by saying, “What therefore God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder,” showing that the act was both
against nature, and against law; against nature, because one flesh is
dissevered; against law, because that when God hath joined and
commanded it not to be divided, ye conspire to do this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p26">2. What then ought they to have done after this? Ought
they not to have held their peace, and to have commended the saying?
ought they not to have marvelled at His wisdom? ought they not to have
stood amazed at His accordance with the Father? But none of these
things do they, but as though they were contending for <i>the law</i>,
they say, “How then did Moses command to give a writing of
divorcement, and to put her away?”<note n="2382" id="iii.LIX-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 7" id="iii.LIX-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|19|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.7">Matt. xix.
7</scripRef>. [“How” is
substituted for “why.”]</p></note> And yet they ought not now to have brought this forward, but rather He
to them; but nevertheless He doth not take advantage of them, nor doth
He say to them, “I am not now bound by this,” but He solves
this too.</p>

<pb n="365" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_365.html" id="iii.LIX-Page_365" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p28">And indeed if He had been an alien from the old
covenant, He would not have striven for Moses, neither would He have
argued positively from the things done once for all at the beginning;
He would not have studied to show that His own precepts agreed with
those of old.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p29">And indeed Moses had given many other commandments
besides, both those about meats, and those about the Sabbath; wherefore
then do they nowhere bring him forward, as here? From a wish to enlist
the multitude of the husbands against him. For this was considered a
thing indifferent with the Jews, and all used to do so much as this.
Accordingly it was for this reason that when so many things had been
said on the mount, they remembered this commandment only now.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p30">Nevertheless, unspeakable wisdom maketh a defense even
for these things, and saith, “Moses for the hardness of your
hearts” thus made the law. And not even him doth He suffer to
remain under accusation, forasmuch as He had Himself given him the law;
but delivers him from the charge, and turns the whole upon their head,
as everywhere He doth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p31">For again when they were blaming His disciples for
plucking the ears of corn, He shows themselves to be guilty; and when
they were laying a transgression to their charge as to their not
washing their hands, He shows themselves to be the transgressors, and
touching the Sabbath also: both everywhere, and here in like
manner.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p32">Then because the saying was hard to bear, and brought on
them much blame, He quickly directs back His discourse to that ancient
law, saying as He had said before also, “But in the beginning it
was not so,” that is, God by His acts at the beginning ordained
the contrary. For in order that they may not say, Whence is it
manifest, that “for our hardness Moses said this?” hereby
again He stoppeth their mouths. For if this were the primary law, and
for our good, that other would not have been given at the beginning;
God in creating would not have so created, He would not have said such
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p33">“But I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his
wife except it be for fornication, and marry another, committeth
adultery.”<note n="2383" id="iii.LIX-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p34">[The citation agrees with the briefer reading,
accepted by Tischendorf; comp. R.V. margin.—R.]</p></note> For since he had stopped their mouths, He then gives the law with His
own authority, like as touching the meats, like as touching the
Sabbath.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p35">For with regard to the meats likewise, when He had
overcome them, then, and not till then, He declared unto the multitude,
that, “Not that which goeth in defileth the man;”<note n="2384" id="iii.LIX-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p36"><scripRef passage="Matt. xv. 11" id="iii.LIX-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|15|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.15.11">Matt. xv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p41">For now they understood the saying more than before.
Therefore then indeed they held their peace, but now when there hath
been gainsaying, and answering, and question, and learning by reply,
and the law appeared more clear, they ask Him. And openly to contradict
they do not dare, but they bring forward what seemed to be a grievous
and galling result of it, saying, “If the case of the man be so
with his wife, it is not good to marry.” For indeed it seemed to
be a very hard thing to have a wife full of every bad quality, and to
endure a wild beast perpetually shut up with one in the house. And that
thou mayest learn that this greatly troubled them, Mark said,<note n="2388" id="iii.LIX-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p42"><scripRef passage="Mark x. 10" id="iii.LIX-p42.1" parsed="|Mark|10|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.10.10">Mark x.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p43">3. But what is, “If such be the case of a man with
his wife?” That is, if to this end he is joined with her, that
they should be one, or, on the other hand, if the man shall get to
himself blame for these things, and always transgresses by putting
away, it were easier to fight against natural desire and against
one’s self, than against a wicked woman.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p44">What then saith Christ? He said not, “yea, it is
easier, and so do,” lest they should suppose that the thing is a
law; but He subjoined, “Not all men receive it, but they to whom
it is given,”<note n="2389" id="iii.LIX-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 11" id="iii.LIX-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|19|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.11">Matt. xix.

drawing them on, and urging them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p46">But see herein a contradiction. For He indeed saith this
is a great thing; but they, that it is easier. For it was meet that
both these things should be done, and that it should be at once
acknowledged a great thing by Him, that it might render them more
forward, and by the things said by themselves it should be shown to be
easier, that on this ground too they might the rather choose virginity
and continence. For since to speak of

<pb n="366" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_366.html" id="iii.LIX-Page_366" />

virginity seemed to be grievous, by the
constraint of this law He drove them to this desire. Then to show the
possibility of it, He saith, “There are some eunuchs, who were so
born from their mother’s womb, there are some eunuchs which were
made eunuchs of men, and there be eunuchs which have made themselves
eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven’s sake,”<note n="2390" id="iii.LIX-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p47"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 12" id="iii.LIX-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|19|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.12">Matt. xix.
12</scripRef>.</p></note>by these words secretly leading them to choose the thing, and
establishing the possibility of this virtue, and all but saying,
Consider if thou wert in such case by nature, or hadst endured this
selfsame thing at the hands of those who inflict such wanton injuries,
what wouldest thou have done, being deprived indeed of the enjoyment,
yet not having a reward? Thank God therefore now, for that with rewards
and crowns thou undergoest this, which those men endure without crowns;
or rather not even this, but what is much lighter, being supported both
by hope, and by the consciousness of the good work, and not having the
desire so raging like waves within thee.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p48">For the excision of a member is not able to quell such
waves, and to make a calm, like the curb of reason; or rather, reason
only can do this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p49">For this intent therefore He brought in those others,
even that He might encourage these, since if this was not what He was
establishing, what means His saying concerning the other eunuchs? But
when He saith, that they made themselves eunuchs, He means not the
excision of the members, far from it, but the putting away of wicked
thoughts. Since the man who hath mutilated himself, in fact, is subject
even to a curse, as Paul saith, “I would they were even cut
off<note n="2391" id="iii.LIX-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p50"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIX-p50.1">ἀποκψονται</span>,

12</scripRef>. [Whatever be the meaning
of the verb in Galatians, there can be no question that the use here
made of the passage is forced.—R.]</p></note> And very reasonably. For such a one is venturing on the deeds of
murderers, and giving occasion to them that slander God’s
creation, and opens the mouths of the Manichæans, and is guilty of
the same unlawful acts as they that mutilate themselves amongst the
Greeks. For to cut off our members hath been from the beginning a work
of demoniacal agency, and satanic device, that they may bring up a bad
report upon the work of God, that they may mar this living creature,
that imputing all not to the choice, but to the nature of our members,
the more part of them may sin in security, as being irresponsible; and
doubly harm this living creature, both by mutilating the members, and
by impeding the forwardness of the free choice in behalf of good
deeds.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p52">These are the ordinances of the devil, bringing in,
besides the things which we have mentioned, another wicked doctrine
also, and making way beforehand for the arguments concerning destiny
and necessity even from hence, and everywhere marring the freedom given
to us of God, and persuading us that evil deeds are of nature, and
hence secretly implanting many other wicked doctrines, although not
openly. For such are the devil’s poisons.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p53">Therefore I beseech you to flee from such lawlessness.
For together with the things I have mentioned, neither doth the force
of lust become milder hereby, but even more fierce. For from another
origin hath the seed that is in us its sources, and from another cause
do its waves swell. And some say from the brain, some from the loins,
this violent impulse hath its birth; but I should say from nothing else
than from an ungoverned will and a neglected mind: if this be
temperate, there is no evil result from the motions of nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p54">Having spoken then of the eunuchs that are eunuchs for
nought and fruitlessly, unless with the mind they too practise
temperance, and of those that are virgins for Heaven’s sake, He
proceeds again to say, “He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it,” at once making them more earnest by showing that the
good work is exceeding in greatness, and not suffering the thing to be
shut up in the compulsion of a law, because of His unspeakable
gentleness. And this He said, when He showed it to be most possible, in
order that the emulation of the free choice might be greater.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p55">And if it is of free choice, one may say, how doth He
say, at the beginning, “All men do not receive it, but they to
whom it is given?” That thou mightest learn that the conflict is
great, not that thou shouldest suspect any compulsory allotments. For
it is given to those, even to the willing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p56">But He spake thus to show that much influence from above
is needed by him who entereth these lists, whereof He that is willing
shall surely partake. For it is customary for Him to use this form of
speech when the good work done is great, as when He saith, “To
you it is given to know the mysteries.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p57">And that this is true, is manifest even from the present
instance. For if it be of the gift from above only, and they that live
as virgins contribute nothing themselves, for nought did He promise
them the kingdom of Heaven, and distinguish them from the other
eunuchs.</p>

<pb n="367" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_367.html" id="iii.LIX-Page_367" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p58">But mark thou, I pray, how from some men’s wicked
doings, other men gain. I mean, that the Jews went away having learnt
nothing, for neither did they ask with the intent of learning, but the
disciples gained even from hence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p59">4. “Then were there brought unto Him little
children, that He should put His hands on them, and pray: and the
disciples rebuked them. But He said unto them, Suffer the little
children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven. And He
laid His hands on them, and departed thence.”<note n="2393" id="iii.LIX-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p60"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 13-15" id="iii.LIX-p60.1" parsed="|Matt|19|13|19|15" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.13-Matt.19.15">Matt. xix.
13–15</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p61">And wherefore did the disciples repel the little
children? For dignity. What then doth He? Teaching them to be lowly,
and to trample under foot worldly pride, He doth receive them, and
takes them in His arms, and to such as them promises the kingdom; which
kind of thing He said before also.<note n="2394" id="iii.LIX-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p62"><scripRef passage="Matt. xviii. 3, 4" id="iii.LIX-p62.1" parsed="|Matt|18|3|18|4" osisRef="Bible:Matt.18.3-Matt.18.4">Matt.
xviii. 3, 4</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p63">Let us also then, if we would be inheritors of the
Heavens, possess ourselves of this virtue with much diligence. For this
is the limit of true wisdom; to be simple with understanding; this is
angelic life; yes, for the soul of a little child is pure from all the
passions. Towards them who have vexed him he bears no resentment, but
goes to them as to friends, as if nothing had been done; and how much
soever he be beaten by his mother; after her he seeks, and her doth he
prefer to all. Though thou show him the queen with a diadem, he prefers
her not to his mother clad in rags, but would choose rather to see her
in these, than the queen in splendor. For he useth to distinguish what
pertains to him and what is strange to him, not by its poverty and
wealth, but by friendship. And nothing more than necessary things doth
he seek, but just to be satisfied from the breast, and then he leaves
sucking. The young child is not grieved at what we are grieved, as at
loss of money and such things as that, and he doth not rejoice again at
what we rejoice, namely, at these temporal things, he is not eager
about the beauty of persons.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p64">Therefore He said, “of such is the kingdom of
Heaven,” that by choice we should practise these things, which
young children have by nature. For since the Pharisees from nothing
else so much as out of craft and pride did what they did, therefore on
every hand He charges the disciples to be single hearted, both darkly
hinting at those men, and instructing these. For nothing so much lifts
up unto haughtiness, as power and precedence. Forasmuch then as the
disciples were to enjoy great honors throughout the whole world, He
preoccupies their mind, not suffering them to feel anything after the
manner of men, neither to demand honors from the multitude, nor to have
men clear the way<note n="2395" id="iii.LIX-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p65"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIX-p65.1">σοβεν</span>.</p></note>before them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p66">For though these seem to be little things, yet are they
a cause of great evils. The Pharisees at least being thus trained were
carried on into the very summit of evil, seeking after the salutations,
the first seats, the middle places,<note n="2396" id="iii.LIX-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p67"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LIX-p67.1">μεσασμος</span>.</p></note>for from these they were cast upon the shoal of their mad desire of
glory, then from thence upon impiety. So therefore those men went away
having drawn upon themselves a curse by their tempting, but the little
children a blessing, as being freed from all these.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p68">Let us then also be like the little children, and
“in malice be we babes.”<note n="2397" id="iii.LIX-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p69"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiv. 20" id="iii.LIX-p69.1" parsed="|1Cor|14|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.14.20">1 Cor. xiv.
20</scripRef>.</p></note> For it cannot be, it cannot be for one otherwise to see Heaven, but the
crafty and wicked must needs surely be cast into hell.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p70">5. And before hell too, we shall here suffer the utmost
ills. “For if thou be evil,” it is said, “thou alone
shalt endure the evil; but if good, it is for thyself and for thy
neighbor.”<note n="2398" id="iii.LIX-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p71"><scripRef passage="Prov. ix. 12" id="iii.LIX-p71.1" parsed="|Prov|9|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.9.12">Prov. ix.

For neither was anything more wicked than Saul, nor more simple and
single-hearted than David. Which therefore was the stronger? Did not
David get him twice into his hands, and having the power to slay him,
forebore? Had he not him shut up as in a net and prison, and spared
him? And this when both others were urging him, and when he himself was
able to accuse him of countless charges; but nevertheless he suffered
him to go away safe. And yet the other was pursuing him with all his
army, but he was, with a few desperate fugitives, wandering and
changing from place to place; nevertheless the fugitive had the
advantage of the king, forasmuch as the one came to the conflict with
simplicity, the other with wickedness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p72">For what could be more wicked than that man, who when he
was leading his armies, and bringing all his wars to a successful
issue, and undergoing the labors of the victory and the trophies, but
bringing the crowns to him, assayed to slay him?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p73">6. Such is the nature of envy, it is ever plotting
against its own honors, and wasting him that hath it, and encompassing
him with countless calamities. And that miserable man, for instance,
until David departed, burst not forth into that piteous cry,
bewail

<pb n="368" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_368.html" id="iii.LIX-Page_368" />

ing himself and saying,
“I am sore distressed, and the Philistines make war against me,
and the Lord is departed from me.”<note n="2399" id="iii.LIX-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p74"><scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxviii. 15" id="iii.LIX-p74.1" parsed="|1Sam|28|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.28.15">1 Sam.

safety and in glory; for indeed unto the king passed the glory of the
captain. For neither was the man disposed to usurpation, nor did he
assay to depose the other from his throne, but for him did he achieve
all things, and was earnestly attached to him, and this is evident even
from what followed afterwards. For when indeed he was set under him,
any one of them who do not search carefully might perhaps suppose these
things to be by the usual custom of a subject; but after he had
withdrawn himself out of Saul’s kingdom, what then was there to
restrain him, and to him even to slay? Had not the other been evil
towards him once, twice, and often? Was it not after having received
benefits from him? Was it not having nothing whereof to accuse him? Was
not Saul’s kingdom and safety danger and insecurity to himself?
must he not needs wander and be a fugitive, and be in trembling for
fear of the utmost ills, while the other is alive, and reigning?
Nevertheless none of these things constrained him to stain his sword
with blood, but when he saw him asleep, and bound, and alone, and in
the midst of his own men, and had touched his head, and when there were
many rousing him to it, and saying the opportunity thus favorable was a
judgment of God, he at once rebuked those who were urging him on, and
refrained from the murder, and sent him away both safe and well; and as
though he had been rather a body guard of his, and a shield-bearer, not
an enemy, so did he chide the host for their treachery towards the
king.<note n="2400" id="iii.LIX-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p75"><scripRef passage="1 Sam. xxvi. 16" id="iii.LIX-p75.1" parsed="|1Sam|26|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.26.16">1 Sam.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p76">What could be equal to this soul? What to that mildness?
For this it is possible to see even by the things that have been
mentioned but much more by what are done now. For when we have
considered our vileness, then we shall know more perfectly the virtue
of those saints. Wherefore I entreat you to hasten towards the
emulation of them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p77">For indeed if thou lovest glory, and for this cause art
plotting against thy neighbor, then shalt thou enjoy it more largely,
when having spurned it, thou wilt abstain from the plotting. For like
as to become rich<note n="2401" id="iii.LIX-p77.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LIX-p78"><span class="c11" id="iii.LIX-p78.1">Mss</span>., “not to make
money,” and presently, “not to love glory;” but
Savile’s reading is rightly adopted by Mr. Field, with the Latin
Translator.</p></note>is contrary to covetousness, so is the loving of glory to the obtaining
of glory. And if ye be minded, let us inquire into each. For since we
have no fear of hell, nor much regard for the kingdom, come and even
from the things present let us lead you on.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p79">For who are they that are ridiculous? Tell me. Is it not
they that are doing anything for the sake of glory from the multitude?
And who are the objects of praise? Is it not they who spurn the praise
of the multitude? Therefore if the love of vainglory be matter of
reproach, and it cannot be concealed that the vainglorious man loves
it, he will assuredly be an object of reproach, and the love of glory
is become to him a cause of dishonor. And not in this respect only doth
he disgrace himself, but also in that he is compelled to do many things
shameful, and teeming with the utmost disgrace. And like as with
respect to their gains men are wont to suffer harm more than anything
from the disease of covetousness (they become at least the subjects of
many tricks, and of small gains make great losses, wherefore this
saying hath prevailed even to be a proverb); and as to the voluptuous
man likewise, his passion becomes a hindrance to the enjoyment of his
pleasure. These at least that are exceedingly given up thereto, and are
the slaves of women these above all do women carry about as servants,
and will never vouchsafe to treat them as men, buffeting, spurning
them, leading, and taking them about everywhere, and giving themselves
airs, and in everything merely giving them orders.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p80">Even so also than him that is arrogant and mad about
glory, and accounts himself to be high, nothing is more base and
dishonored. For the race of man is fond of contention, and against
nothing else doth it set itself so much, as against a boaster, and a
contemptuous man, and a slave of glory.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p81">And he himself too, in order to maintain the fashion of
his pride, exhibits the conduct of a slave to the common sort,
flattering, courting them, serving a servitude more grievous than that
of one bought for money.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LIX-p82">Knowing then all these things, let us lay down these
passions, that we may not both pay a penalty here, and there be
punished without end. Let us become lovers of virtue. For so both
before reaching the kingdom we shall reap the greatest benefits here,
and when we are departed thither we shall partake of the eternal
blessings; unto which God grant we may all attain by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might world
without end. Amen.</p>

true.”<note n="2406" id="iii.LX-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p11"><scripRef passage="John v. 31" id="iii.LX-p11.1" parsed="|John|5|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.31">John v.
31</scripRef>.</p></note> When therefore He saith, “There is none good;” not as
putting Himself out from being good doth He say this, far from it; for
he said not, “Why dost thou call me good? I am not good;”
but, “there is none good,” that is, none amongst men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p12">And when He saith this self-same thing, He saith it not
as depriving even men of goodness, but in contradistinction to the
goodness of God. Wherefore also He added, “But one, that is,
God;” and He said not, “but my Father,” that thou
mightest learn that He had not revealed Himself to the young man. So
also further back He called men evil, saying, “If ye, being evil,
know how to give good gifts to your children.”<note n="2407" id="iii.LX-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p13"><scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 11" id="iii.LX-p13.1" parsed="|Matt|7|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.11">Matt. vii.
11</scripRef>.</p></note> For indeed there too He called them evil, not as condemning the whole
race as evil (for by “ye,” He means not “ye
men”), but comparing the goodness that is in men with the
goodness of God, He thus named it; therefore also He added, “How
much more shall your Father give good things to them that ask
Him?” And what was there to urge Him,<note n="2408" id="iii.LX-p13.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p14">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LX-p14.1">φησν</span>,
“one may say,” occurs in the Greek here.—R.]</p></note>or what the profit that He should answer in this way? He leads him on
by little and little, and teaches him to be far from all flattery,
drawing him off from the things upon each, and fastening him upon God,
and persuading him to seek after the things to come, and to know that
which is really good, and the root and fountain of all things, and to
refer the honors to Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p15">Since also when He saith, “Call no one master upon
earth,” it is in contradistinction to Himself He saith this, and
that they might learn what is the chief sovereignty over all things
that are. For neither was it a small forwardness the young man had
shown up to this time in having fallen into such a desire; and when of
the rest some were tempting, some were coming to Him for the cure of
diseases, either their own or others, he for eternal life was both
coming to Him, and discoursing with Him. For fertile was the land and
rich, but the multitude of the thorns choked the seed. Mark at any rate
how he is prepared thus far for obedience to the commandments. For
“By doing what,” he saith, “shall I inherit eternal
life?” So ready was he for the performance of the things that
should be told him. But if he had come unto Him, tempting Him, the
evangelist would have declared this also to us, as He doth also with
regard to the others, as in the case of the lawyer. And though himself
had been silent, Christ could not have suffered

<pb n="370" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_370.html" id="iii.LX-Page_370" />

him to lie concealed, but would have convicted
him plainly, or at least would have intimated it, so that he should not
seem to have deceived Him, and to be hidden, and thereby have suffered
hurt.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p16">If he had come unto Him tempting, he would not have
departed sorrowing for what he heard. This was not at any rate ever the
feeling of any of the Pharisees, but they grew fierce when their mouths
were stopped. But not so this man; but he goeth away cast down, which
is no little sign that not with an evil will he had come unto Him, but
with one too feeble, and that he did indeed desire life, but was held
in subjection by another and most grievous feeling.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p17">Therefore when Christ said, “If thou wilt enter
into life, keep the commandments,” he saith, “Which?”
Not tempting, far from it, but supposing there were some others besides
those of the law that should procure him life, which was like one who
was very desirous. Then since Jesus mentioned those out of the law, he
saith, “All these things have I kept from my youth
up.”<note n="2409" id="iii.LX-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 20" id="iii.LX-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|19|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.20">Matt. xix.
20</scripRef>. [R.V. omits “from
my youth up.”]</p></note> And neither at this did he stop, but again asks, “What lack I
yet?” which itself again was a sign of his very earnest desire.<note n="2410" id="iii.LX-p18.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p19">[An important sentence is omitted here: “But
that also was not a little thing which he supposed he lacked, nor did
he think that what he had said sufficed for attaining what he
desired.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p20">What then saith Christ? Since He was going to enjoin
something great, He setteth forth the recompenses, and saith, “If
thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,
and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: and come, and follow
me.”<note n="2411" id="iii.LX-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="iii.LX-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt. xix.
21</scripRef>. [R.V., “If thou
wouldest,” etc.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p22">2. Seest thou how many prizes, how many crowns, He
appoints for this race? If he had been tempting, He would not have told
him these things. But now He both saith it, and in order to draw him
on, He also shows him the reward to be great, and leaves it all to his
own will, by all means throwing into the shade that which seemed to be
grievous in His advice. Wherefore even before mentioning the conflicts
and the toil, He shows him the prize, saying “If thou wilt be
perfect,” and then saith, “Sell that thou hast, and give to
the poor,” and straightway again the rewards, “Thou shalt
have treasure in Heaven; and come, and follow me.” For indeed to
follow Him is a great recompense. “And thou shalt have treasure
in Heaven.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p23">For since his discourse was of money, even of all did He
advise him to strip himself, showing that he loses not what he hath,
but adds to his possessions, He gave him more than He required him to
give up; and not only more, but also as much greater as Heaven is
greater than earth, and yet more so.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p24">But He called it a treasure, showing the plenteousness
of the recompense, its permanency, its security, so far as it was
possible by human similitudes to intimate it to the hearer. It is not
then enough to despise wealth, but we must also maintain poor men, and
above all things follow Christ; that is, do all the things that are
ordered by Him, be ready for slaughter and daily death. “For if
any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me.”<note n="2412" id="iii.LX-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p25"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 24" id="iii.LX-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|16|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.24">Matt. xvi.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> So that to cast away one’s money is a much less thing than this
last commandment, to shed even one’s very blood; yet not a little
doth our being freed from wealth contribute towards this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p26">“But when the young man heard it, he went away
sorrowful.”<note n="2413" id="iii.LX-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 22" id="iii.LX-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|19|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.22">Matt. xix.
22</scripRef>.</p></note> After this the evangelist, as it were to show that he hath not felt
anything it was unlikely he should feel, saith, “For he had<note n="2414" id="iii.LX-p27.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p28">[R.V., “he was one that had,” etc.]</p></note>great possessions.” For they that have little are not equally
held in subjection, as they that are overflowed with great affluence,
for then the love of it becomes more tyrannical. Which thing I cease
not always saying, that the increase of acquisitions kindles the flame
more, and renders the getters poorer, inasmuch as it puts them in
greater desire, and makes them have more feeling of their want.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p29">See, for example, even here what strength did this
passion exhibit. Him that had come to Him with joy and forwardness,
when Christ commanded him to cast away his riches, it so overwhelmed
and weighed down, as not to suffer him so much as to answer touching
these things, but silenced and become dejected and sullen to go
away.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p30">What then saith Christ? “How hardly shall the rich
enter into the kingdom of Heaven!”<note n="2415" id="iii.LX-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 23" id="iii.LX-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|19|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.23">Matt. xix.
23</scripRef>. [The citation is a
combination of this verse and <scripRef passage="Mark x. 23" id="iii.LX-p31.2" parsed="|Mark|10|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.10.23">Mark x. 23</scripRef>. The influence of Mark’s more
striking account is seen throughout the Homily.—R.]</p></note>blaming not riches but them that are held in subjection by them. But if
the rich man “hardly,” much more the covetous man. For if
not to give one’s own be an hindrance to entering the kingdom,
even to take of other men’s goods, think how much fire it heapeth
up.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p32">Why can it have been, however, that He said to His
disciples, that “hardly shall a rich man enter in,” they
being poor men, and having no possessions? Instructing them not to be
ashamed of their poverty, and, as

<pb n="371" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_371.html" id="iii.LX-Page_371" />

it were, excusing Himself to them for suffering
them to have nothing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p33">But having said it was hard; as He proceeds, He shows
that it is even impossible, and not merely impossible, but even in the
highest degree impossible; and this He showed by the comparison
concerning the camel and the<note n="2416" id="iii.LX-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p34"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LX-p34.1">βελνην</span>.</p></note>needle.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p35">“It is easier” saith He, “for a camel
to enter in by the eye of a needle,<note n="2417" id="iii.LX-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p36">[R.V., with the same Greek text, renders, “to
go through a needle’s eye.” The variation in the English
above seems unnecessary.—R.]</p></note>than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”<note n="2418" id="iii.LX-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 24" id="iii.LX-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|19|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.24">Matt. xix.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> Whence it is shown, that there is no ordinary reward for them that are
rich, and are able to practise self command. Wherefore also He affirmed
it to be a work of God, that He might show that great grace is needed
for him who is to achieve this. At least, when the disciples were
troubled, He said, “With men this is impossible; but with God all
things are possible.”<note n="2419" id="iii.LX-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 26" id="iii.LX-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|19|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.26">Matt. xix.
26</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p39">And wherefore are the disciples troubled, being poor,
yea, exceedingly poor? Wherefore then are they confounded? Being in
pain about the salvation of the rest, and having a great affection for
all, and having already taken upon themselves the tender bowels of
teachers. They were at least in such trembling and fear for the whole
world from this declaration, as to need much comfort.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p40">Therefore, having first “beheld them, He said unto
them, The things which are impossible with men, are possible with
God.” For with a mild and meek look, having soothed their
shuddering mind, and having put an end to their distress (for this the
evangelist signified by saying, “He beheld them”), then by
His words also He relieves them, bringing before them God’s
power, and so making them feel confidence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p41">But if thou wilt learn the manner of it likewise, and
how what is impossible may become possible, hear. Born either for this
end did He say, “The things which are impossible with men, are
possible with God,” that thou shouldest give it up, and abstain,
as from things impossible; but that having considered the greatness of
the good work, thou shouldest hasten to it readily, and having besought
God to assist thee in these noble contests, shouldest attain unto
life.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p42">3. How then should this become possible? If thou cast
away what thou hast, if thou empty thyself of thy wealth, if thou
refrain from the wicked desire. For in proof that He does not refer it
to God alone, but that to this end He said it, that thou shouldest know
the vastness of the good work, hear what follows. For when Peter had
said, “Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed Thee,”
and had asked, “What shall we have therefore?” having
appointed the reward for them; He added, “And every one who hath
forsaken houses, or lands, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or
mother, shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit eternal
life.”<note n="2420" id="iii.LX-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 27-29" id="iii.LX-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|19|27|19|29" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.27-Matt.19.29">Matt. xix.
27–29</scripRef>. [The position of
the word “lands” is peculiar; “or wife” is not
found here, but occurs in Homily LXIV. 1.—R.]</p></note> Thus that which is impossible becometh possible. But how may this very
thing be done, one may say, to forsake these? how is it possible for
him that is once sunk in such lust of wealth, to recover himself? If he
begin to empty himself of his possessions, and cut off what are
superfluous. For so shall he both advance further, and shall run on his
course more easily afterwards.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p44">Do not then seek all at once, but gently, and by little
and little, ascend this ladder, that leads thee up to Heaven.<note n="2421" id="iii.LX-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p45">[The following clause is omitted in the translation:
“though (or, if) as a whole it seems difficult to
them.”—R.]</p></note> For like as those in fevers having acrid bile abounding within them,
when they cast in thereon meats and drinks, so far from quenching their
thirst, do even kindle the flame; so also the covetous, when they cast
in their wealth upon this wicked lust more acrid than that bile, do
rather inflame it. For nothing so stays it as to refrain for a time
from the lust of gain, like as acrid bile is stayed by abstinence and
evacuations.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p46">But this itself, by what means will it be done? one may
say. If thou consider, that whilst rich, thou wilt never cease
thirsting, and pining with the lust of more; but being freed from thy
possessions, thou wilt be able also to stay this disease. Do not then
encompass thyself with more, lest thou follow after things
unattainable, and be incurable, and be more miserable than all, being
thus frantic.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p47">For answer me, whom shall we affirm to be tormented and
pained? him that longs after costly meats and drinks, and is not able
to enjoy them as he will, or him that hath not such a desire? It is
quite clear one must say, him that desires, but cannot obtain what he
desires. For this is so painful, to desire and not to enjoy, to thirst
and not to drink, that Christ desiring to describe hell to us,
described it in this way, and introduced the rich man thus tormented.
For longing for a drop of water, and not enjoying it, this was his
punishment. So then he that despises wealth quiets the desire, but he
that desires to be rich<note n="2422" id="iii.LX-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p48">[The Greek adds here, <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LX-p48.1">κα
περιβλλεσθαι
πλεω</span>, and to possess himself of
more.—R.]</p></note>hath inflamed it more, and not yet

<pb n="372" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_372.html" id="iii.LX-Page_372" />

doth he stay; but though he have got ten thousand talents,
he desireth as much more; though he obtain these, again he aims at
twice as much more, and going on he desires even the mountains, and the
earth, and the sea, and all to become gold for him, being mad with a
kind of new and fearful madness, and one that can never thus be
extinguished.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p49">And that thou mightest learn, that not by addition but
by taking away this evil is stayed; if thou hadst ever had an absurd
desire to fly and to be borne through the air, how wouldest thou
extinguish this unreasonable desire? By fashioning wings, and preparing
other instruments, or by convincing the mind that it is desiring things
impossible, and that one should attempt none of these things? It is
quite plain, that by convincing the mind. But that, thou mayest say, is
impossible. But this again is more impossible, to find a limit for this
desire. For indeed it is more easy for men to fly, than to make this
lust cease by an addition of more. For when the objects of desire are
possible, one may be soothed by the enjoyment of them, but when they
are impossible, one must labor for one thing, to draw ourselves off
from the desire, as otherwise at least it is not possible to recover
the soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p50">Therefore that we may not have superfluous sorrows, let
us forsake the love of money that is ever paining, and never endures to
hold its peace, and let us remove ourselves to another love, which both
makes us happy, and hath great facility, and let us long after the
treasures above. For neither is the labor here so great, and the gain
is unspeakable, and it is not possible for him to fail of them who is
but in any wise watchful and sober, and despises the things present;
even as on the other hand, as to him that is a slave to these last, and
is utterly given up to them, it as altogether of necessity that he fail
of those better riches.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p51">4. Considering then all these things, put away the
wicked desire of wealth. For neither couldest thou say this, that it
gives the things present, though it deprive us of the things to come,
albeit even if this were so, this were extreme punishment, and
vengeance. But now not even this may be. For besides hell, and before
that hell, even here it casts thee into a more grievous punishment. For
many houses hath this lust overthrown, and fierce wars hath it stirred
up, and compelled men to end their lives by a violent death; and before
these dangers it ruins the nobleness of the soul, and is wont often to
make him that hath it cowardly, and unmanly, and rash, and false, and
calumnious, and ravenous, and over-reaching, and all the worst
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p52">But seeing perhaps the brightness of the silver, and the
multitude of the servants, and the beauty of the buildings, the court
paid in the market-place, art thou bewitched thereby? What remedy then
may there be for this evil wound? If thou consider how these things
affect thy soul, how dark, and desolate, and foul they render it, and
how ugly; if thou reckon with how many evils these things were
acquired, with how many labors they are kept, with how many dangers: or
rather they are not kept unto the end, but when thou hast escaped the
attempts of all, death coming on thee is often wont to remove these
things into the hand of thine enemies, and goeth and taketh thee with
him destitute, drawing after thee none of these things, save the wounds
and the sores only, which the soul received from these, before its
departing. When then thou seest any one resplendent outwardly with
raiment and large attendance, lay open his conscience, and thou shalt
see many a cobweb within, and much dust. Consider Paul, Peter. Consider
John, Elias, or rather the Son of God Himself, who hath not where to
lay His head. Be an imitator of Him, and of His servants, and imagine
to thyself the unspeakable riches of these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p53">But if having obtained a little sight by these, thou
shouldest be darkened again, as in any shipwreck when a storm hath come
on, hear the declaration of Christ, which affirms, that it is
impossible “for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
Heaven.” And against this declaration set the mountains, and the
earth, and the sea; and all things, if thou wilt, suppose<note n="2423" id="iii.LX-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p54"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LX-p54.1">τ λγ
ποησον</span>.</p></note>to be gold; for thou shalt see nothing equal to the loss arising to
thee from thence. And thou indeed makest mention of acres of land, so
many and so many, and of houses ten or twenty or even more, and of
baths as many, and of slaves a thousand, or twice as many, and of
chariots fastened with silver and overlaid with gold; but I say this,
that if each one of you that are rich were to leave this poverty (for
these things are poverty compared with what I am about to say), and
were possessed of a whole world, and each of them had as many men as
are now everywhere on land and sea, and each a world both sea and land,
and everywhere buildings, and cities, and nations, and from every side
instead of water, instead of fountains, gold flowed up for him, I would
not say those who are thus rich are worth three farthings, when they
are cast out of the kingdom.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p55">For if now aiming at riches that perish,

<pb n="373" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_373.html" id="iii.LX-Page_373" />

when they miss them, they are tormented, if
they should obtain a perception of those unspeakable blessings, what
then will suffice for consolation for them? There is nothing. Tell me
not then of the abundance of their possessions, but consider how great
loss the lovers of this abundance undergo in consequence thereof, for
these things losing Heaven, and being in the same state, as if any one
after being cast out of the highest honor in kings’ courts,
having a dung heap, were to pride himself on that. For the storing up
of money differs nothing from that, or rather that is even the better.
For that is serviceable both for husbandry, and for heating a bath, and
for other such uses, but the buried gold for none of these things. And
would it were merely useless; but as it is, it kindles moreover many
furnaces for him that hath it, unless he use it rightly; countess evils
at least spring therefrom.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LX-p56">Therefore they that are without used to call the love of
money the citadel<note n="2424" id="iii.LX-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LX-p57">Mr. Field cites Stobæus, p. 130, 52, of Bion,

things worthy of emulation, not gorgeous buildings not costly estates,
but the men that have much confidence towards God, those that have
riches in Heaven, the owners of those treasures, them that are really
rich, them that are poor for Christ’s sake, that we may attain
unto the good things of eternity by the grace and love towards man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto the Father, together with the
Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and always and world without end.

as all? Yea, saith he, but not for display do I say these things, but
in order that by this question I may bring in the multitude of the
poor. For since the Lord had said, “If thou wilt be perfect, sell
that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
Heaven;”<note n="2426" id="iii.LXI-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p5"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="iii.LXI-p5.1" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt. xix.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>lest any one of the poor should say, What then? if I have no
possessions, can I not be perfect? Peter asks, that thou, the poor man,
mayest learn, that thou art made in no respect inferior by this: Peter
asks, that thou mayest not learn from Peter and doubt (for indeed he
was imperfect as yet, and void of the Spirit), but that, having
received the declaration from Peter’s Master, thou mayest be
confident.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p6">For like as we do (we make things our own often when
speaking of the concerns of others), so did the apostle, when he put to
Him this question in behalf of all the world. Since that at least he
knew with certainty his own portion, is manifest from what had been
said before; for he that had already received the keys of the Heavens,
much more might feel confidence about the things hereafter.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p7">But mark also how exactly his reply is according to
Christ’s demand. For He had required of the rich man these two
things, to give that he had to the poor, and to follow Him. Wherefore
he also expresses these two things, to forsake, and to follow.
“For behold we have forsaken all,” saith he, “and
have followed Thee.” For the forsaking was done for the sake of
following, and the following was rendered easier by the forsaking, and
made them feel confidence and joy touching the forsaking.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p8">What then saith He? “Verily, I say unto you, that
ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man
shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit

<pb n="374" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_374.html" id="iii.LXI-Page_374" />

upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel.”<note n="2427" id="iii.LXI-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p9"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 28" id="iii.LXI-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|19|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.28">Matt. xix.
28</scripRef>.</p></note> What then, one may say, shall Judas sit there? By no means. How, then,
doth He say, “Ye shall sit on twelve thrones?” how shall
the terms of the promise be fulfilled?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p10">Hear how, and on what principle. There is a law ordained
of God, recited by Jeremiah, the prophet to the Jews, and in these
words: “At what instant I shall speak a sentence concerning a
nation and kingdom, to pluck up and destroy; if that nation turn from
their evil deeds, I also will repent of the evils, which I thought to
do unto them. And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and
kingdom to build and to plant it; and if they do evil in my sight, that
they obey not my voice, I also will repent of the good, which I said I
would do unto them.”<note n="2428" id="iii.LXI-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p11"><scripRef passage="Jer. xviii. 7-10" id="iii.LXI-p11.1" parsed="|Jer|18|7|18|10" osisRef="Bible:Jer.18.7-Jer.18.10">Jer. xviii.
7–10</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p12">For the same custom do I observe with respect to the
good things as well, saith He. For though I spake of building up,
should they show themselves unworthy of the promise, I will no longer
do it. Which sort of thing was done with respect to man upon his
creation, “For the dread of you,” it is said, “and
the fear of you shall be on the wild beasts,”<note n="2429" id="iii.LXI-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p13"><scripRef passage="Gen. ix. 2" id="iii.LXI-p13.1" parsed="|Gen|9|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.9.2">Gen. ix.
2</scripRef>.</p></note>and it came not to pass, for he proved himself unworthy of the
sovereignty, even as did Judas also.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p14">For in order that neither at the denunciations of
punishment any men should despair and become more hardened, nor by the
promises of good things be rendered causelessly more remiss, He
remedies both these evils, by that which I have before mentioned,
saying in this way: Though I should threaten, do not despair; for thou
art able to repent, and to reverse the denunciation, like the
Ninevites. Though I should promise any good thing, grow not remiss
because of the promise. For shouldest thou appear unworthy, the fact of
my having promised will not advantage thee, but will rather bring
punishment. For I promise thee being worthy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p15">Therefore even then in His discourse with His disciples
He did not promise to them simply, for neither did He say,
“you,” only, but added, “which have followed
me,” that He might both cast out Judas, and draw towards Him
those that should come afterwards. For neither to them only was it
said, nor to Judas any more, when he had become unworthy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p16">Now to the disciples He promised things to come, saying,
“Ye shall sit on twelve thrones,” for they were now of a
higher stamp, and sought after none of the things of the present world,
but to the rest He promises also what are here.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p17">For “every one,” He saith, “that hath
forsaken brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, or house, for my name’s sake, shall receive
an hundredfold in this world, and shall inherit eternal
life.”<note n="2430" id="iii.LXI-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 29" id="iii.LXI-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|19|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.29">Matt. xix.

from that in the last Homily. The order here is that of Tischendorf
(not of R.V. or rec. text): “or wife” occurs here;
“house” is substituted for
“houses.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p19">For lest any after having heard the word
“ye,” should suppose this a thing peculiar to the disciples
(I mean now the enjoying the greatest and first honors in the things to
come), He extended the word, and spread the promise over the whole
earth, and from the things present establishes the things to come also.
And to the disciples also at the beginning, when they were in a more
imperfect state, He reasoned from the things present. For when He drew
them from the sea, and took them from their trade, and commanded them
to forsake the ships, He made mention not of Heaven, not of thrones,
but of the things here, saying, “I will make you fishers of
men;” but when He had wrought them to be of higher views, then
after that He discourses of the things to come also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p20">2. But what is, “Judging the twelve tribes of
Israel?” This is, “condemning them.” For they are not
surely to sit as judges, but like as He said the Queen of the South
should condemn that generation, and the Ninevites shall condemn them;
so now these also. Therefore He said not, the nations, and the world,
but the tribes of Israel. For since both the Jews alike and the
apostles had been brought up under the same laws, and customs, and
polity; when the Jews said, that for this cause they could not believe
in Christ, because the law forbade to receive His commandments, by
bringing forward these men, who had received the same law, and yet had
believed, He condemns all those; like as even already He had said,
“therefore they shall be your judges.”<note n="2431" id="iii.LXI-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 27" id="iii.LXI-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|12|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.27">Matt. xii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p22">And what great thing doth He promise them, it may be
said, if what the Ninevites have and the Queen of the South, this these
are to have also? In the first place He had promised them many other
things before this, and after this doth promise them, and this alone is
not their reward.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p23">And besides even in this He intimated by the way
something more than these things. For of those He simply said, The men
of Nineveh shall rise up and condemn this gen

concerning these, not merely thus, but how? “When the Son of Man
shall sit upon the throne of His glory, then shall ye also sit upon
twelve thrones,” saith He, declaring, that they also shall reign
with Him, and partake of that glory. “For if we suffer,” it
is said, “we shall also reign with Him.”<note n="2433" id="iii.LXI-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p25"><scripRef passage="2 Tim. ii. 12" id="iii.LXI-p25.1" parsed="|2Tim|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.2.12">2 Tim. ii.

alone is the one that shall sit and judge, but honor and glory
unspeakable did He intimate by the thrones.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p26">To these then He spake of these things, but to all the
rest of eternal life and an hundredfold here. But if to the rest, much
more to these too, both these things, and the things in this life.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p27">And this surely came to pass; for when they had left a
fishing rod and a net, they possessed with authority the substances of
all, the prices of the houses and the lands, and the very bodies of the
believers. For often did they choose even to be slain for their sake,
as Paul also bears witness to many, when he saith, “If it had
been possible ye would have plucked out your eyes, and given them to
me.”<note n="2434" id="iii.LXI-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p28"><scripRef passage="Gal. iv. 51" id="iii.LXI-p28.1" parsed="|Gal|4|51|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.51">Gal. iv.

should part it from the body, but that we should prefer godliness to
all things; this too He saith also with respect to wife and
brethren.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p30">But He seems to me here to intimate also the
persecutions. For since there were many instances both of fathers
urging their sons to ungodliness, and wives their husbands; when they
command these things, saith He, let them be neither wives nor parents,
even as Paul likewise said, “But if the unbelieving depart, let
him depart.”<note n="2436" id="iii.LXI-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p31"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 15" id="iii.LXI-p31.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.15">1 Cor. vii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p32">When He had then raised the spirit of all, and had
persuaded them to feel confidence both with respect to themselves and
to all the world, He added, that “Many that were first shall be
last, and last first.”<note n="2437" id="iii.LXI-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 30" id="iii.LXI-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|19|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.30">Matt. xix.

others likewise, it is spoken also concerning these men and concerning
the Pharisees, who did not believe, even as before also He had said,
“Many shall come from east and west and shall sit down with
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; but the children of the kingdom shall be
cast out.”<note n="2438" id="iii.LXI-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 11, 12" id="iii.LXI-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|8|11|8|12" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.11-Matt.8.12">Matt. viii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p35">Then He adds also a parable, as training those who had
fallen short to a great forwardness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p36">“For the kingdom of Heaven,” He said,
“is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in
the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed
with them for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p37">“And at the third hour he saw others standing
idle, and to them too he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and
whatsoever is right I will give you. And about the sixth and ninth
hours he did likewise. And about the eleventh hour, he saw others
standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
But they say unto him, No man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye
also into my vineyard, and whatsoever is right, ye shall
receive.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p38">“So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard
saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire,
beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were
hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. And the
first supposed that they should receive more, and they received
likewise every man a penny. And when they had received it, they
murmured against the good man of the house, saying, These last have
wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us that have
borne the burden and heat of the day. But he answered one of them, and
said, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a
penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way; I will give unto this last
also, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with
mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? Thus the last shall be
first, and the first last: for many are called, but few
chosen.”<note n="2439" id="iii.LXI-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 1" id="iii.LXI-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|20|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.1">Matt. xx.
1</scripRef>. [This long passage agrees
closely with the rec. text. In <scripRef passage="Matt. 20.5,6" id="iii.LXI-p39.2" parsed="|Matt|20|5|20|6" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.5-Matt.20.6">verses 5, 6</scripRef>, the New Testament narrative is
abridged, but there are scarcely any other peculiarities.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p40">3. What is to us the intent of this parable? For the
beginning doth not harmonize with what is said at the end, but
intimates altogether the contrary. For in the first part He shows all
enjoying the same, and not some cast out, and some brought in; yet He
Himself both before the parable and after the parable said the opposite
thing. “That the first shall be last, and the last first,”
that is, before the very first, those not continuing first, but having
become last. For in proof that this is His meaning, He added,
“Many are called, but few chosen,” so as doubly

<pb n="376" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_376.html" id="iii.LXI-Page_376" />

both to sting the one, and to soothe and
urge on the other.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p41">But the parable saith not this, but that they shall be
equal to them that are approved, and have labored much. “For thou
hast made them equal unto us,” it is said, “that have borne
the burden and heat of the day.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p42">What then is the meaning of the parable? For it is
necessary to make this first clear, and then we shall clear up that
other point. By a vineyard He meaneth the injunctions of God and His
commandments: by the time of laboring, the present life: by laborers,
them that in different ways are called to the fulfillment of the
injunctions: by early in the morning, and about the third and ninth and
eleventh hours, them who at different ages have drawn near to God, and
approved themselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p43">But the question is this, whether the first having
gloriously approved themselves, and having pleased God, and having
throughout the whole day shone by their labors, are possessed by the
basest feeling of vice, jealousy and envy. For when they had seen them
enjoying the same rewards, they say, “These last have wrought but
one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, that have borne the
burden and heat of the day.” And in these words, when they are to
receive no hurt, neither to suffer diminution as to their own hire,
they were indignant, and much displeased at the good of others, which
was proof of envy and jealousy. And what is yet more, the good man of
the house in justifying himself with respect to them, and in making his
defense to him that had said these things, convicts him of wickedness
and the basest jealousy, saying, “Didst thou not agree with me
for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way; I will give unto the
last even as unto thee. Is thine eye evil, because I am
good?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p44">What then is it which is to be established by these
things? For in other parables also this self-same thing may be seen.
For the son who was approved is brought in, as having felt this
self-same thing, when he saw his prodigal brother enjoying much honor,
even more than himself. For like as these enjoyed more by receiving
first, so he in a greater degree was honored by the abundance of the
things given him; and to these things he that was approved bears
witness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p45">What then may we say? There is no one who is thus
justifying himself, or blaming others in the kingdom of Heaven; away
with the thought! for that place is pure from envy and jealousy. For if
when they are here the saints give their very lives for sinners, much
more when they see them there in the enjoyment of these things, do they
rejoice and account these to be blessings of their own. Wherefore then
did He so frame His discourse? The saying is a parable, wherefore
neither is it right to inquire curiously into all things in parables
word by word,<note n="2440" id="iii.LXI-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p46"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXI-p46.1">κατ
λξιν</span>.</p></note>but when we have learnt the object for which it was composed, to reap
this, and not to busy one’s self about anything further.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p47">Wherefore then was this parable thus composed? what is
its object to effect? To render more earnest them that are converted
and become better men in extreme old age, and not to allow them to
suppose they have a less portion. So it is for this cause He introduces
also others displeased at their blessings, not to represent those men
as pining or vexed, away with the thought! but to teach us that these
have enjoyed such honor, as could even have begotten envy in others.
Which we also often do, saying, “Such a one blamed me, because I
counted thee worthy of much honor,” neither having been blamed,
nor wishing to slander that other, but hereby to show the greatness of
the gift which this one enjoyed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p48">But wherefore can it have been that He did not hire all
at once? As far as concerned Him, He did hire all; but if all did not
hearken at once, the difference was made by the disposition of them
that were called. For this cause, some are called early in the morning,
some at the third hour, some at the sixth, some at the ninth, some at
the eleventh, when they would obey.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p49">This Paul also declared when he said, “When it
pleased Him, who separated me from my mother’s womb.”<note n="2441" id="iii.LXI-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p50"><scripRef passage="Gal. i. 15" id="iii.LXI-p50.1" parsed="|Gal|1|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.1.15">Gal. i.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> When did it please Him? When he was ready to obey. For He willed it
even from the beginning, but because he would not have yielded, then it
pleased Him, when Paul also was ready to obey. Thus also did He call
the thief, although He was able to have called him even before, but he
would not have obeyed. For if Paul at the beginning would not have
obeyed, much more the thief.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p51">And if they say, “No man hath hired us,” in
the first place as I said we must not be curious about all the points
in the parables; but here neither is the good man of the house
represented to say this, but they; but he doth not convict them, that
he might drive them to perplexity, but might win them over. For that He
called all, as far as lay in Him, from the first even the parable
shows, saying, that “He went out early in the morning to
hire.”</p>

<pb n="377" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_377.html" id="iii.LXI-Page_377" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p52">4. From everything then it is manifest to us, that the
parable is spoken with reference to them who from earliest youth, and
those who in old age and more tardily, lay hold on virtue; to the
former, that they may not be proud, neither reproach those called at
the eleventh hour; to the latter, that they may learn that it is
possible even in a short time to recover all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p53">For since He had been speaking about earnestness, and
the casting away of riches, and contempt of all one’s
possessions, but this needed much vigor of mind and youthful ardor; in
order to kindle in them a fire of love, and to give vigor to their
will, He shows that it is possible even for men coming later to receive
the hire of the whole day.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p54">But He doth not say it thus, lest again He should make
them proud, but he shows that the whole is of His love to man, and
because of this they shall not fail, but shall themselves enjoy the
unspeakable blessings.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p55">And this chiefly is what it is His will to establish by
this parable. And if He adds, that, “So the last shall be first
and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen,” marvel
not. For not as inferring it from the parable doth He say this, but His
meaning is this, that like as this came to pass, so shall that come to
pass. For here indeed the first did not become last, but all received
the same contrary to hope and expectation. But as this result took
place contrary to hope and contrary to expectation, and they that came
before were equalled by them that followed, so shall that also come to
pass which is more than this, and more strange, I mean, that the last
should come to be even before the first, and that the first should be
after these. So that that is one thing, and this another.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p56">But He seems to me to say these things, darkly hinting
at the Jews, and amongst the believers at those who at first shone
forth, but afterwards neglected virtue, and fell back; and those others
again that have risen from vice, and have shot beyond many. For we see
such changes taking place both with respect to faith and practice.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p57">Wherefore I entreat you let us use much diligence both
to stand in the right faith, and to show forth an excellent life. For
unless we add also a life suitable to our faith, we shall suffer the
extremest punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p58">And this the blessed Paul showed even from times of old,
when he said, that “They did all eat the same spiritual meat, and
did all drink the same spiritual drink:” and added, that they
were not saved; “for they were overthrown in the
wilderness.”<note n="2442" id="iii.LXI-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p59"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 3, 4, 5" id="iii.LXI-p59.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|3|10|5" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.3-1Cor.10.5">1 Cor. x.
3, 4, 5</scripRef>.</p></note> And Christ declared it even in the evangelists, when He brought in some
that had cast out devils and prophesied, and are led away to
punishment. And all His parables also, as that of the virgins, that of
the net, that of the thorns, that of the tree not bringing forth fruit,
demand virtue in our works. For concerning doctrines He discourses
seldom, for neither doth the subject need labor, but of life often or
rather everywhere, for the war about this is continual, wherefore also
so is the labor.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p60">And why do I speak of the whole code. For even a part of
it overlooked brings upon one great evils; as, for instance, almsgiving
overlooked casts into hell them that have come short in it; and yet
this is not the whole of virtue, but a part thereof. But nevertheless
both the virgins were punished for not having this, and the rich man
was for this cause tormented, and they that have not fed the hungry,
are for this condemned with the devil. Again, not to revile is a very
small part of it, nevertheless this too casts out them that have not
attained to it. “For he that saith to his brother, Thou fool,
shall be in danger of hell fire.”<note n="2443" id="iii.LXI-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p61"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 22" id="iii.LXI-p61.1" parsed="|Matt|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.22">Matt. v.

no one shall see the Lord. For, “Follow peace,” it is said,
“and holiness,<note n="2444" id="iii.LXI-p61.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p62"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXI-p62.1">ἁγιασμν</span>, comp. <scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 3" id="iii.LXI-p62.2" parsed="|1Thess|4|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.3">1 Thess. iv. 3</scripRef>. [R.V.,

though any one should fulfill other good works, but have not attained
to this, he is unclean with God. And this is manifest from the
Pharisee, who though abounding with numberless good works, by this lost
all.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p64">But I have also something more than these things to say
again. I mean, that not only one of them overlooked shuts Heaven
against us, but though it be done, yet not in due perfection and
abundance, it produces the selfsame effect again. “For except
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”<note n="2446" id="iii.LXI-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p65"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 20" id="iii.LXI-p65.1" parsed="|Matt|8|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.20">Matt. viii.

enter in.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p66">And how much did they bestow in alms? one may ask. For
this very thing, I am minded to say now, that they who do not give may
be roused to give, and they that give may not pride themselves, but may
make increase of their gifts. What then did they give? A tenth of all
their possessions, and again another tenth, and after this a third, so
that they almost gave away the

<pb n="378" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_378.html" id="iii.LXI-Page_378" />

third part, for three-tenths put together make
up this. And together with these, first fruits, and first born, and
other things besides, as, for instance, the offerings for sins, those
for purification, those at feasts, those in the jubilee,<note n="2447" id="iii.LXI-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p67"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXI-p67.1">᾽Ιωβηλα</span>.</p></note>those by the cancelling of debts, and the dismissals of servants, and
the lendings that were clear of usury. But if he who gave the third
part of his goods, or rather the half (for those being put together
with these are the half), if then he who is giving the half, achieves
no great thing, he who doth not bestow so much as the tenth, of what
shall he be worthy? With reason He said, “There are few that be
saved.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p68">5. Let us not, then, despise the care of our life. For
if one portion of it despised brings so great a destruction, when on
every hand we are subject to the sentence of condemnation, how shall we
escape the punishment? and what manner of penalty shall we not suffer?
and what manner of hope of salvation have we, one may ask, if each of
the things we have numbered threatens us with hell? I too say this;
nevertheless, if we give heed we may be saved, preparing the medicines
of almsgiving, and attending to our wounds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p69">For oil does not so strengthen a body, as benevolence at
once strengthens a soul, and makes it invincible to all and impregnable
to the devil. For wheresoever he may seize us, his hold then slips,
this oil not suffering his grasp to fix on our back.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p70">With this oil therefore let us anoint ourselves
continually. For it is the cause of health, and a supply of light, and
a source of cheerfulness. “But such a one,” thou wilt say,
“hath talents of gold so many and so many, and gives away
nothing.” And what is that to thee? For thus shalt thou appear
more worthy of admiration, when in poverty thou art more munificent
than he. It was on this ground Paul marvelled at the Macedonians, not
because they gave, but because even though they were in poverty they
gave.<note n="2448" id="iii.LXI-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXI-p71"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. viii. 1, 2, 3" id="iii.LXI-p71.1" parsed="|2Cor|8|1|8|3" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.8.1-2Cor.8.3">2 Cor.

another, but deliver thyself from the charge against thee. Since the
punishment is greater when thou at the same time blamest others, and

subject to the same judgment. For if even them who do right He permits
not to judge others, much more will He not permit offenders. Let us not

their ease, but unto Jesus, and from thence let us draw our

thee, neither such a one as to lead thee on to these things? More
abundant then will be the praise, the commendation greater, when not
even being supplied with teachers thou hast become one to be marvelled
at.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p78">For this is possible, nay very easy, if we be willing:
and this they show, who first duly performed these things, as for
instance, Noah, Abraham, Melchizedeck, Job, and all the men like them.
To them it is needful to look every day, and not unto these, whom ye
never cease emulating, and passing about their names in your
assemblies. For nothing else do I hear you saying everywhere, but such
words as these; “Such a one has bought so many acres of land;
such a one is rich, he is building.” Why dost thou stare, O man,
at what is without? Why dost thou look to others? If thou art minded to
look to others, look to them that do their duty, to them that approve
themselves, to them that carefully fulfill the law, not to those that
have become offenders, and are in dishonor. For if thou look to these,
thou wilt gather hence many evil things, falling into remissness, into
pride, into condemnation of others; but if thou reckon over them that
do right, thou wilt lead thyself on unto humility, unto diligence, unto
compunction, unto the blessings that are beyond number.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXI-p82">This do thou also. For thou art not set to judge of the
negligences of which others have been guilty, nor to inquire into the
sins which others are committing; thou art required to do judgment on
thyself, not on others. “For if we judged ourselves,” it is
said, “we should not be judged, but when we are judged, we are

said, “eternal life:” then He assails the city next, and
being on the point of going up, discourses again of His passion. For
since it was likely that they, because they were not willing this
should come to pass, would forget it, He is continually putting them in
remembrance, exercising their mind by the frequency with which He
reminded them, and diminishing their pain.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p9">But He speaks with them “apart,”
necessarily; for it was not meet that His discourse about these things
should be published to the many; neither that it should be spoken
plainly, for no advantage arose from this. For if the disciples were
confounded at hearing these things, much more the multitude of the
people.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p10">What then? was it not told to the people? you may say.
It was indeed told to the people also, but not so plainly. For,
“Destroy,” saith He, “this Temple, and in three days
I will raise it up;”<note n="2460" id="iii.LXII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p11"><scripRef passage="John ii. 19" id="iii.LXII-p11.1" parsed="|John|2|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.2.19">John ii.

again, “Yet a little

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p14">But to the disciples not so, but as the other things He
spake unto them more plainly, so also spake He this too. And for what
purpose, if the multitude understood not the force of His sayings, were
they spoken at all? That they might learn after these things, that
fore-knowing it, He came to His passion, and willing it; not in
ignorance, nor by constraint. But to the disciples not for this cause
only did He foretell it; but, as I have said, in order that having been
exercised by the expectation, they might more easily endure the
passion, and that it might not confound them by coming upon them
without preparation. So for this cause, while at the beginning He spake
of His death only, when they were practised and trained to hear of it,
He adds the other circumstances also; as, for instance, that they
should deliver Him to the Gentiles, that they should mock and scourge
Him; as well on this account, as in order that when they saw the
mournful events come to pass, they might expect from this the
resurrection also. For He who had not cloaked from them what would give
pain, and what seemed to be matter of reproach, would reasonably be
believed about good things too.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p15">But mark, I pray thee, how with regard to the time also
He orders the thing wisely. For neither at the beginning did He tell
them, lest He should disquiet them, neither at the time itself, lest by
this again He should confound them; but when they had received
sufficient proof of His power, when He had given them promises that
were very great concerning life everlasting, then He introduces also
what He had to say concerning these things, once and twice and often
interweaving it with His miracles and His instructions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p16">But another evangelist saith, that He brought in the
prophets also as witnesses;<note n="2463" id="iii.LXII-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p17"><scripRef passage="Luke xviii. 31" id="iii.LXII-p17.1" parsed="|Luke|18|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.31">Luke xviii.
31</scripRef>.</p></note>and another again saith, that even they themselves understood not His
words, but the saying was hid from them, and that they were amazed as
they followed Him.<note n="2464" id="iii.LXII-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p18"><scripRef passage="Mark 10.32; 9.32; Luke 18.34" id="iii.LXII-p18.1" parsed="|Mark|10|32|0|0;|Mark|9|32|0|0;|Luke|18|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.10.32 Bible:Mark.9.32 Bible:Luke.18.34">Mark x. 32; comp.

xviii. 34</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p19">Surely then, one may say, the benefit of the prediction
is taken away. For if they knew not what they were hearing, neither
could they look for the event, and not looking for it, neither could
they be exercised by their expectations.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p20">But I say another thing also more perplexing than this:
If they did not know, how were they sorry. For another saith, they were
sorry. If therefore they knew it not, how were they sorry? How did
Peter say, “Be it far from Thee. This shall not be unto
Thee?”<note n="2465" id="iii.LXII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p21"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 22" id="iii.LXII-p21.1" parsed="|Matt|16|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.22">Matt. xvi.
22</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p22">What then may we say? That He should die indeed they
knew, albeit they knew not clearly the mystery of the Incarnation.<note n="2466" id="iii.LXII-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p23">Lit., “economy.”</p></note> Neither did they know clearly about the resurrection, neither what He
was to achieve; and this was hid from them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p24">For this cause also they felt pain. For some they had
known to have been raised again by other persons, but for any one to
have raised up himself again, and in such wise to have raised himself
as not to die any more, they had never known.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p25">This then they understood not, though often said; nay
nor of this self-same death did they clearly know what it was, and how
it should come on Him. Wherefore also they were amazed as they followed
Him, but not for this cause only; but to me at least He seems even to
amaze them by discoursing of His passion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p26">2. Yet none of these things made them take courage, and
this when they were continually hearing about His resurrection. For
together with His death this also especially troubled them, to hear
that men should “mock and scourge Him,” and the like. For
when they considered His miracles, the possessed persons whom He had
delivered, the dead whom He had raised, all the other marvellous works
which He was doing, and then heard these things, they were amazed, if
He who doeth these works is thus to suffer. Therefore they fell even
into perplexity, and now believed, now disbelieved, and could not
understand His sayings. So far at least were they from understanding
clearly what He said, that the sons of Zebedee at the same time came to
Him, and spake to Him of precedence. “We desire,” it is
said, “that one should sit on Thy right hand, and one on Thy
left.”<note n="2467" id="iii.LXII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. 20.21; Mark 10.37" id="iii.LXII-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|20|21|0|0;|Mark|10|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.21 Bible:Mark.10.37">Matt. xx. 21. Comp. Mark x. 37</scripRef>.</p></note> How then doth this evangelist say, that their mother came to Him? It is
probable both things were done. I mean, that they took their mother
with them, with the purpose of making their entreaty stronger, and in
this way to prevail with Christ.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p28">For in proof that this is true, as I say, and the
request was rather theirs, and that being ashamed they put forward
their mother, mark how Christ directs His words to them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p29">But rather let us learn, first, what do they ask, and
with what disposition, and whence they were moved to this? Whence then
were they moved to this? They saw themselves honored above the rest,
and expected from that they should obtain this request also.

<pb n="381" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_381.html" id="iii.LXII-Page_381" />

But what can it be they ask? Hear another
evangelist plainly declaring this. For, “Because He was
nigh,” it is said, “to Jerusalem, and because they thought
the kingdom of God should immediately appear,”<note n="2468" id="iii.LXII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p30"><scripRef passage="Luke xix. 11" id="iii.LXII-p30.1" parsed="|Luke|19|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.19.11">Luke xix.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>they asked these things. For they supposed that this was at the doors,
and visible, and that having obtained what they asked, they would
undergo none of the painful things. For neither for its own sake only
did they seek it, but as though they would also escape the
hardships.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p31">Wherefore also Christ in the first place leads them off
from these thoughts, commanding them to await slaughter and dangers,
and the utmost terrors. For, “Are ye able,” saith He,
“to drink of the cup that I drink of?”<note n="2469" id="iii.LXII-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 22" id="iii.LXII-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|20|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.22">Matt. xx.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p33">But let no man be troubled at the apostles being in such
an imperfect state. For not yet was the cross accomplished, not yet the
grace of the Spirit given. But if thou wouldest learn their virtue,
notice them after these things, and thou wilt see them superior to
every passion. For with this object He reveals their deficiencies, that
after these things thou mightest know what manner of men they became by
grace.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p34">That then they were asking, in fact, for nothing
spiritual, neither had a thought of the kingdom above, is manifest from
hence. But let us see also, how they come unto Him, and what they say.
“We would,” it is said, “that whatsoever we shall
desire of Thee, Thou shouldest do it for us.”<note n="2470" id="iii.LXII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p35"><scripRef passage="Mark x. 35" id="iii.LXII-p35.1" parsed="|Mark|10|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.10.35">Mark x.

the wound, and so apply the medicine. But they out of shame and
confusion of face, because under the influence of a human passion they
were come to do this, took Him privately apart from the disciples, and
asked Him. For they went before, it is said, so that it might not be
observable to them, and so said what they wished. For it was their
desire, as I suppose, because they heard, “Ye shall sit on twelve
thrones,” to have the first place of these seats. And that they
had an advantage over the others, they knew, but they were afraid of
Peter, and say, “Command, that one sit on Thy right hand, one on
Thy left;” and they urge Him, saying, “Command.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p38">What then saith He? Showing, that they asked nothing
spiritual, neither, if they had known again what they were asking,
would they have ventured to ask for so much, He saith, “Ye know
not what ye ask,” how great, how marvellous, how surpassing even
the powers above. After that He adds, “Are ye able to drink of
the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that
I am baptized with?”<note n="2472" id="iii.LXII-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p39">[The longer reading is here accepted. The R.V.
follows a briefer reading here and in <scripRef passage="Matt. 20.23" id="iii.LXII-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|20|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.23">verse 23</scripRef>.—R.]</p></note> Seest thou, how He straightway drew them off from their suspicion, by
framing His discourse from the contrary topics? For ye, He saith, talk
to me of honor and crowns, but I to you of conflicts and labors. For
this is not the season for rewards, neither shall that glory of mine
appear now, but the present time is one of slaughter, and wars, and
dangers.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p40">And see how by the form of His question, He both urges
and attracts them. For He said not, “Are ye able to be
slain?” “Are ye able to pour forth your blood?” but
how? “Are ye able to drink of the cup?” Then to attract
them to it, He saith, “Which I shall drink of,” that by
their fellowship with Him in it they might be made more ready.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p41">And a baptism again calls He it; showing that great was
the cleansing the world was to have from the things that were being
done.</p>

even this which they were saying, but looking to hear what they had
asked.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p44">What then saith He? “Ye shall drink indeed of my
cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized
with.”<note n="2474" id="iii.LXII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 23" id="iii.LXII-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|20|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.23">Matt. xx.

suffer; ye shall close your life by a violent death, and in these
things ye shall be partakers with me; “But to sit on my right
hand and on my left is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them
for whom it is prepared of my Father.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p46">3. Having first elevated their souls, and made them of a
higher character, and having rendered them such as sorrow could not
subdue, then He reproves their request.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p47">But what can be this present saying? For indeed there
are two points that are subjects of inquiry to many: one, if it be
prepared for any to sit on His right hand; and then, if the Lord of all
hath not power to bestow it on them for whom it is prepared.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p48">What then is the saying? If we solve the former point,
then the second also will be clear to the inquirers. What then is this?
No one shall sit on His right hand nor on His left. For that throne is
inaccessible to all, I

do not say
to men only, and saints, and apostles, but even to angels, and
archangels, and to all the powers that are on high.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p49">At least Paul puts it as a peculiar privilege of the
Only-Begotten, saying, “To which of the angels said He at any
time, Sit thou on my right hand?<note n="2475" id="iii.LXII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p50"><scripRef passage="Heb. i. 13" id="iii.LXII-p50.1" parsed="|Heb|1|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.13">Heb. i.

Son, ‘Thy throne, O God.’”<note n="2476" id="iii.LXII-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p51"><scripRef passage="Heb. i. 7, 8" id="iii.LXII-p51.1" parsed="|Heb|1|7|1|8" osisRef="Bible:Heb.1.7-Heb.1.8">Heb. i. 7,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p52">How then saith He, “To sit on my right hand and on
my left is not mine to give,” as though there are some that
should sit there? Not as though there are; far from it; but He makes
answer to the thoughts of them who ask the favor, condescending to
their understanding. For neither did they know that lofty throne, and
His sitting at the right hand of the Father; how should they, when even
the things that were much lower than these, and were daily instilled
into them, they understood not? but they sought one thing only, to
enjoy the first honors, and to stand before the rest, and that no one
should stand before them with Him; even as I have already said before,
that, since they heard of twelve thrones, in ignorance what the saying
could mean, they asked for the first place.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p53">What therefore Christ saith is this: “Ye shall die
indeed for me, and shall be slain for the sake of the gospel, and shall
be partakers with me, as far as regards the passion: but this is not
sufficient to secure you the enjoyment of the first seat, and to cause
that ye should occupy the first place. For if any one else should come,
together with the martyrdom, possessed of all the other parts of virtue
far more fully than you, not because I love you now, and prefer you to
the rest, therefore shall I set aside him that is distinguished by his
good works, and give the first honors to you.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p54">But thus indeed He did not say it, so as not to pain
them, but darkly He intimates the self-same thing, saying, “Ye
shall drink indeed of my cup, and ye shall be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left,
this is not mine to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it is
prepared.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p55">But for whom is it prepared? For them who could become
distinguished by their works. Therefore He said not, It is not mine to
give, but my Father’s, lest any should say that He was too weak,
or wanting in vigor for their recompense; but how? It is not mine, but
of those for whom it is prepared.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p56">And in order that what I say may be more plain, let us
work it on an illustration, and let us suppose there was some master of
the games, then that many excellent combatants went down to the
contest, and that some two of the combatants that were most nearly
connected with the master of the games were to come to him and say,
“Cause us to be crowned and proclaimed,” confiding in their
good-will and friendship with him; and that he were to say to them,
“This is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom
it is prepared, by their labors, and their toils;” should we
indeed condemn him as powerless? By no means, but we should approve him
for his justice, and for having no respect of persons. Like then as we
should not say that he did not give the crown from want of vigor, but
as not wishing to corrupt the law of the games, nor to disturb the
order of justice; in like manner now should I say Christ said this,
from every motive to compel them, after the grace of God, to set their
hopes of salvation and approval on the proof of their own good
works.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p57">Therefore He saith, “For whom it is
prepared.” For what, saith He, if others should appear better
than you? What, if they should do greater things? For shall ye, because
ye have become my disciples, therefore enjoy the first honors, if ye
yourselves should not appear worthy of the choice?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p58">For that He Himself hath power over the whole, is
manifest from His having the entire judgment. For to Peter too He
speaks thus, “I will give thee the keys of the
Heavens.”<note n="2477" id="iii.LXII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p59"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 19" id="iii.LXII-p59.1" parsed="|Matt|16|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.19">Matt. xvi.

and rendering is commented on in the note on Homily LIV.

laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous judge, will give me in that day; and not to me only, but unto
all them also which have loved His appearing.”<note n="2478" id="iii.LXII-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p60"><scripRef passage="2 Tim. iv. 8" id="iii.LXII-p60.1" parsed="|2Tim|4|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Tim.4.8">2 Tim. iv.

Paul, is surely clear to every one.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p61">And if He hath expressed these things somewhat
obscurely, marvel not. For to lead them on by hidden instruction,<note n="2479" id="iii.LXII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p62"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXII-p62.1">οκονομικ</span>.</p></note>not to be rudely pressing Him without object or cause for the first
honors (for from a human passion they felt this), and not wishing to
give them pain, by the obscurity He effects both these objects.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p63">“Then were the ten moved with indignation with
respect to the two.” Then. When.? When He had reproved them. So
long as the judgment was Christ’s, they were not moved with
indignation; but seeing them preferred,

<pb n="383" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_383.html" id="iii.LXII-Page_383" />

they were contented, and held their peace, out
of reverence and honor to their Master.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p64">And if they were vexed in mind, yet they dared not utter
this. And when they had some feeling of human weakness towards Peter,
at the time that He gave the didrachmas, they did not give way to
anger, but asked only, “Who then is greatest?” But since
here the request was the disciples’, they are moved with
indignation. And not even here are they straightway moved with
indignation, when they asked, but when Christ had reproved them, and
had said they should not enjoy the first honors, unless they showed
themselves worthy of these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p65">4. Seest thou how they were all in an imperfect state,
when both these were lifting themselves up above the ten, and those
envying the two? But, as I said, show me them after these things, and
thou wilt see them delivered from all these passions. Hear at least how
this same John, he who now came to Him for these things, everywhere
gives up the first place to Peter, both in addressing the people, and
in working miracles, in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>

beginning he was so greatly filled with warmth, and so forsook all the

excellent.<note n="2483" id="iii.LXII-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p71"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXII-p71.1">ἄκροι</span>.</p></note>

before His word, and by drawing them near Him. For the two having
separated themselves from the company of the ten, had stood nearer Him,
pleading their own interests. Therefore He brings near Him these also,
by this very act, and by exposing and revealing it before the rest,
soothing the passion both of the one and of the other.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p74">And not as before, so now also doth He check them. For
whereas before He brings little children into the midst, and commands
to imitate their simplicity and lowliness; here He reproves them in a
sharper way from the contrary side, saying, “The princes of the
Gentiles exercise dominion<note n="2485" id="iii.LXII-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p75">[R.V., “lord it.”]</p></note>over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them, but it

love the first place. For the passion is tyrannical, and is continually
hindering even great men; therefore also it needs a severer stripe.
Whence He too strikes deeper into them, by comparison with the Gentiles
shaming their inflamed soul, and removes the envy of the one and the
arrogance of the other, all but saying, “Be not moved with
indignation, as insulted. For they harm and disgrace themselves most,
who on this wise seek the first places, for they are amongst the last.
For matters with us are not like matters without. ‘For the
princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them,’ but with me
the last, even he is first.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p78">“And in proof that I say not these things without
cause, by the things which I do and suffer, receive the proof of my
sayings. For I have myself done something even more. For being King of
the powers above, I was willing to become man, and I submitted to be
despised, and despitefully entreated. And not even with these things
was I satisfied, but even unto death did I come. Therefore,” He
saith,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p79">“Even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered

many.”<note n="2488" id="iii.LXII-p79.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p80"><scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 28" id="iii.LXII-p80.1" parsed="|Matt|20|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.28">Matt. xx.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p81">Be not then afraid, as though thine honor were plucked
down. For how much soever thou humblest thyself, thou canst not descend
so much as thy Lord. And yet His descent hath become the ascent of all,
and hath made His own glory shine forth. For before He was made man, He
was known amongst angels only; but after He was made man and was
crucified, so far from lessening that glory, He acquired other besides,
even that from the knowledge of the world.</p>

<pb n="384" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_384.html" id="iii.LXII-Page_384" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p82">Fear not then, as though thine honor were put down, if
thou shouldest abase thyself, for in this way is thy glory more
exalted, in this way it becomes greater. This is the door of the
kingdom. Let us not then go the opposite way, neither let us war
against ourselves. For if we desire to appear great, we shall not be
great, but even the most dishonored of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p83">Seest thou how everywhere He urges them by the opposite
things, giving them what they desire? For in the preceding parts also
we have shown this in many instances, and in the cases of the covetous,
and of the vain-glorious, He did thus. For wherefore, He saith, dost
thou give alms before men? That thou mayest enjoy glory? Thou must then
not do so, and thou shalt surely enjoy it. Wherefore dost thou lay up
treasures? That thou mayest be rich? Thou must then not lay up
treasures, and thou shalt be rich. Even so here too, wherefore dost
thou set thy heart on the first places? That thou mayest be before
others? Choose then the last place, and then thou wilt enjoy the first.
So that if it be thy will to become great, seek not to become great,
and then thou wilt be great. For the other is to be little.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p84">5. Seest thou how He drew them off from the disease, by
showing them both from thence failing of their object, and from hence
gaining, that they might flee the one, and follow after the other.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p85">And of the Gentiles, too, He for this cause reminded
them, that in this way again He might show the thing to be disgraceful
and to be abhorred.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p86">For the arrogant is of necessity base, and, on the
contrary, the lowly-minded is high. For this is the height that is true
and genuine, and exists not in name only, nor in manner of address. And
that which is from without is of necessity and fear, but this is like
to God’s. Such a one, though he be admired by no one, continues
high; even as again the other, though he be courted by all, is of all
men the basest. And the one is an honor rendered of necessity, whence
also it easily passes away; but the other is of principle, whence also
it continues steadfast. Since for this we admire the saints also, that
being greater than all, they humbled themselves more than all.
Wherefore even to this day they continue to be high, and not even death
hath brought down that height.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p87">And if ye be minded, let us by reasonings also inquire
into this very thing. Any one is said to be high, either when he is so
by greatness of stature, or when he hath chanced to be set on a high
place, and low in like manner, from the opposite things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p88">Let us see then who is like this, the boaster, or he
that keeps within measure, that thou mayest perceive that nothing is
higher than lowliness of mind, and nothing lower than boastfulness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p89">The boaster then desires to be greater than all, and
affirms no one to be equal in worth with him; and how much soever honor
he may obtain, he sets his heart on more and claims it, and accounts
himself to have obtained none, and treats men with utter contempt, and
yet seeks after the honor that comes from them; than which what can be
more unreasonable? For this surely is like an enigma. By those, whom he
holds in no esteem, he desires to be glorified.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p90">Seest thou how he who desires to be exalted falls down
and is set on the ground? For that he accounts all men to be nothing
compared with himself, he himself declares, for this is boasting. Why
then dost cast thyself upon him who is nothing? why dost thou seek
honor of him? Why dost thou lead about with thee such great
multitudes?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p91">Seest thou one low, and set on a low place. Come then,
let us inquire about the high man. This one knows what man is, and that
man is a great thing, and that he himself is last of all, and therefore
whatever honor he may enjoy, he reckons this great, so that this one is
consistent with himself and is high, and shifts not his judgment; for
whom he accounts great, the honors that come from them he esteems great
also, though they should chance to be small, because he accounts those
who bestow them to be great. But the boastful man accounts them that
give the honors to be nothing, yet the honors bestowed by them he
reckons to be great.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p92">Again, the lowly man is seized by no passion, no anger
can much trouble this man, no love of glory, no envy, no jealousy: and
what can be higher than the soul that is delivered from these things?
But the boastful man is held in subjection by all these things, like
any worm crawling in the mire, for jealousy and envy and anger are
forever troubling his soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p93">Which then is high? He that is superior to his passions,
or he that is their slave? He that trembles at them and is afraid of
them, or he that is unsubdued, and never taken by them? Which kind of
bird should we say flies higher? that which is higher than the hands
and the arrows of the hunter, or that which does not even suffer the
hunters to need an arrow, from his flying along the ground, and from
not being able ever to elevate himself? Is not then the arrogant man
like this? for indeed every net readily catches him as crawling on the
ground.</p>

<pb n="385" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_385.html" id="iii.LXII-Page_385" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p94">6. But if thou wilt, even from that wicked demon prove
thou this. For what can be baser than the devil, because he had exalted
himself; what higher than the man who is willing to abase himself? For
the former crawls on the ground under our heel (For, “ye
tread,” He saith,<note n="2489" id="iii.LXII-p94.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p95"><scripRef passage="Luke x. 19" id="iii.LXII-p95.1" parsed="|Luke|10|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.19">Luke x.

the angels on high.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p96">But if thou desirest to learn this from the example of
haughty men also, consider that barbarian king, that led so great an
army, who knew not so much as the things that are manifest to all; as,
for instance, that stone was stone, and the images, images; wherefore
he was inferior even to these. But the godly and faithful are raised
even above the sun; than whom what can be higher, who rise above even
the vaults of heaven, and passing beyond angels, stand by the very
throne of the king.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p97">And that thou mayest learn in another way their
vileness; who will be abased? He who has God for his ally, or he with
whom God is at war? It is quite plain that it is he with whom He is at
war. Hear then touching either of these what saith the Scripture.

humble.”<note n="2490" id="iii.LXII-p97.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p98"><scripRef passage="James iv. 6" id="iii.LXII-p98.1" parsed="|Jas|4|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jas.4.6">James iv.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p99">Again, I will ask you another thing also. Which is
higher? He who acts as a priest to God and offers sacrifice? or he who
is somewhere far removed from confidence towards Him? And what manner
of sacrifice doth the lowly man offer? one may say. Hear David saying,
“The sacrifice of God is a contrite spirit; a contrite and

said, “Lest, being lifted up with pride, he should fall into the

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p105">And the thing opposite to what he wishes, befalls him.
For his wish is to be arrogant, that he may be honored; but the most
contemned of all is this character. For these most of all are laughing
stocks, foes and enemies to all men, the most easy to be subdued by
their enemies, the men that easily fall into anger, the unclean before
God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p106">What then can be worse than this, for this is the
extremity of evils? And what is sweeter than the lowly, what more
blessed, since they are longed after, and beloved of God? And the glory
too that cometh of men, these do most of all enjoy, and all honor them
as fathers, embrace them as brothers, receive them as their own
members.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p107">Let us then become lowly, that we may be high. For most
utterly doth arrogance abase. This abased Pharaoh. For, “I know
not,” he saith, “the Lord,”<note n="2495" id="iii.LXII-p107.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p108"><scripRef passage="Exod. v. 2" id="iii.LXII-p108.1" parsed="|Exod|5|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.5.2">Exod. v.

that with his very arms and horses was he drowned in the sea. In direct
opposition to him, Abraham saith, “I am dust and ashes,”<note n="2496" id="iii.LXII-p108.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXII-p109"><scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 27" id="iii.LXII-p109.1" parsed="|Gen|18|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.27">Gen. xviii.

midst of Egyptians, returned, bearing a trophy more glorious than the
former, and, cleaving to this virtue, grew ever more high. Therefore he
is celebrated everywhere, therefore he is crowned and proclaimed; but
Pharaoh is both earth and ashes, and if there is anything else more
vile than these. For nothing doth God so abhor as arrogance. For this
object hath He done all things from the beginning, in order that He
might root out this passion. Because of this are we become mortal, and
are in sorrows, and wailings. Because of this are we in toil, and
sweat, and in labor continual, and mingled with affliction. For indeed
out of arrogance did the first man sin, looking for an equality with
God. Therefore, not even what things he had, did he continue to
possess, but lost even these.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p110">For arrogance is like this, so far from adding to us any
improvement of our life, it subtracts even what we have; as, on the
contrary, humility, so far from subtracting from what we have, adds to
us also what we have not.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXII-p111">This virtue then let us emulate, this let us pursue,
that we may both enjoy present honor, and attain unto the glory to
come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
whom be unto the Father glory and might, together with the Holy Ghost,
now and always, and world without end. Amen.</p>

But this we will leave to them that are fond of learning. For if any

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p6">But let us keep to the things set before us, and let us
listen to these blind men, who were better than many that see. For
neither having a guide, nor being able to see Him when come near to
them, nevertheless they strove to come unto Him, and began to cry with
a loud voice, and when rebuked for speaking, they cried the more. For
such is the nature of an enduring soul, by the very things that hinder,
it is borne up.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p7">But Christ suffered them to be rebuked, that their
earnestness might the more appear, and that thou mightest learn that
worthily they enjoy the benefits of their cure. Therefore He doth not
so much as ask, “Do ye believe?” as He doth with many; for
their cry, and their coming unto Him, sufficed to make their faith
manifest.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p8">Hence learn, O beloved, that though we be very vile and
outcast, but yet approach God with earnestness, even by ourselves we
shall be able to effect whatsoever we ask. See, for instance, these
men, how, having none of the apostles to plead with them, but rather
many to stop their mouths, they were able to pass over the hindrances,
and to come unto Jesus Himself. And yet the evangelist bears witness to
no confidence of life<note n="2498" id="iii.LXIII-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p9"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXIII-p9.1">παησαν

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p10">These then let us also emulate. Though God defer the
gift, though there be many withdrawing us, let us not desist from
asking. For in this way most of all shall we win God to us. See at
least even here, how not poverty, not blindness, not their being
unheard, not their being rebuked by the multitude, not anything else,
impeded their exceeding earnestness. Such is the nature of a fervent
and toiling soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p11">What then saith Christ? “He called them, and said,
What will ye that I should do unto you? They say unto Him, Lord, that
our eyes may be opened.”<note n="2499" id="iii.LXIII-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p12"><scripRef passage="Matt. xx. 32, 33" id="iii.LXIII-p12.1" parsed="|Matt|20|32|20|33" osisRef="Bible:Matt.20.32-Matt.20.33">Matt. xx.

wish to receive one thing, He giveth them another thing. For indeed it
is usual with Him on every occasion, first to make manifest and
discover to all the virtue of those He is healing, and then to apply
the cure, for one reason, that He might lead on the others likewise to
emulation; and for another, that He might show that they were enjoying
the gift worthily. This, for instance, He did with respect to the
Canaanitish woman also, this too in the case of the centurion, this
again as to her that had the issue of blood, or rather that marvellous
woman even anticipated the Lord’s inquiry; but not so did He pass
her by, but even after the cure makes her manifest. Such earnest care
had He on every occasion to proclaim the good deeds of them that come
to Him, and to show them to be much greater than they are,<note n="2500" id="iii.LXIII-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p13">The words, “and to show them to be much
greater than they are,” are rejected by Montfaucon on the

Field. [They are found in all the <span class="c20" id="iii.LXIII-p13.2">mss</span>.
collated by the latter editor, with one exception.—R.] It seems
to be true that our Lord sometimes encouraged faith, and brought out
good example, by putting on an action a higher meaning and intention
than was at all fully formed in the mind of the doer.</p></note>which He doth here also.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p14">Then, when they said what they wished, He had compassion
on them, and touched them. For this alone is the cause of their cure,
for which also He came into the world. But nevertheless, although it be
mercy and grace, it seeks for the worthy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p15">But that they were worthy is manifest, both from what
they cried out, and from the fact that, when they had received, they
did not hasten away, as many do, being ungrateful after the benefits.

for “they followed Him.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p16">“And when He drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and was
come to Bethphage, unto the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His
disciples, saying, Go into the village over against you, and ye shall
find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto
me. And if any man say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need
of them; and straightway he sendeth them. And this was done, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by Zechariah the prophet, Tell ye
the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh to thee, meek, and
sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.”<note n="2501" id="iii.LXIII-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p17"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 1-5" id="iii.LXIII-p17.1" parsed="|Matt|21|1|21|5" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.1-Matt.21.5">Matt. xxi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p18">And yet He had often entered Jerusalem before, but never
with so much circumstance. What then is the cause? It was the beginning
then of the dispensation; and neither was He very well known, nor the
time of His passion near; wherefore He mixed with them with less
distinction, and more disguising Himself. For He would not have been
held in admiration, had He so appeared, and He would have excited them
to greater anger. But when He had both given them sufficient proof of
His power, and the cross was at the doors, He makes Himself then more
conspicuous, and doeth with greater circumstance all the things that
were likely to inflame them. For it was indeed possible for this to
have been done at the beginning also; but it was not profitable nor
expedient it should be so.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p19">But do thou observe, I pray thee, how many miracles are
done, and how many prophecies are fulfilled. He said, “Ye shall
find an ass;” He foretold that no man should hinder them, but
that all, when they heard, should hold their peace.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p20">But this is no small condemnation of the Jews, if them
that were never known to Him, neither had appeared before Him, He
persuades to give up their own property, and to say nothing against it,
and that by His disciples, while these, being present with Him at the
working of His miracles, were not persuaded.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p21">2. And do not account what was done to be a small thing.
For who persuaded them, when their own property was taken from them,
and that, when they were perhaps poor men and husbandmen, not to forbid
it? Why say I not to forbid it? not to ask, or even if they asked, to
hold their peace, and give it up. For indeed both things were alike
marvellous, as well, if they said nothing, when their beasts were
dragged away, or if having spoken, and heard, “The Lord hath need
of them,” they yielded and withstood not, and this when they see
not Him, but His disciples.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p22">By these things He teaches them, that it was in His
power to have entirely hindered the Jews also, even against their will,
when they were proceeding to attack Him, and to have made them
speechless, but He would not.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p23">And another thing again together with these doth He
teach the disciples, to give whatever He should ask; and, though he
should require them to yield up their very life, to give even this, and
not to gainsay. For if even strangers gave up to Him, much more ought
they to strip themselves of all things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p24">And besides what we have said, He was fulfilling also
another prophecy, one which was twofold, one part in words, and another
in deeds. And that in deeds was, by the sitting on the ass; and that by
words, the prediction of Zacharias; because he had said, that the King
should sit on an ass. And He, having sat and having fulfilled it, gave
to the prophecy another beginning again, by what He was doing typifying
beforehand the things to come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p25">How and in what manner? He proclaimed beforehand the
calling of the unclean Gentiles, and that He should rest upon them, and
that they should yield to Him and follow Him, and prophecy succeeded to
prophecy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p26">But to me He seemeth not for this object only to sit on
the ass, but also as affording us a standard of self-denial. For not
only did He fulfill prophecies, nor did He only plant the doctrines of
the truth, but by these very things He was correcting our practice for
us, everywhere setting us rules of necessary use, and by all means
amending our life.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p27">For this cause, I say, even when He was to be born He
sought not a splendid house, nor a mother rich and distinguished, but a
poor woman, and one that had a carpenter as her betrothed husband; and
is born in a shed, and laid in a manger: and choosing His disciples, He
chose not orators and wise men, not rich men and nobly born, but poor
men, and of poor families, and in every way undistinguished; and
providing His table, at one time He sets before Himself barley loaves,
and at another at the very moment commands the disciples to buy at the
market. And making His couch, He makes it of grass, and putting on
raiment, He clothes Himself in

<pb n="388" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_388.html" id="iii.LXIII-Page_388" />

what
is cheap, and in no respect different from the common sort; and a house
He did not so much as possess. And if He had to go from place to place,
He did this travelling on foot, and so travelling, as even to grow
weary. And sitting, He requires no throne nor pillow, but sits on the
ground, sometimes in the mountain, and sometimes by the well, and not
merely by the well, but also alone, and talks with a Samaritan
woman.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p28">Again, setting measures of sorrow, when He had need to
mourn, He weeps moderately, everywhere setting us rules, as I have
said, and limits how far one ought to proceed, and not any further. So
for this intent now also, since it happens that some are weak and have
need of beasts to carry them, in this too He fixes a measure, showing
that one ought not to yoke horses or mules to be borne by them, but to
use an ass, and not to proceed further, and everywhere to be limited by
the want.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p29">But let us look also at the prophecy, that by words,
that by acts. What then is the prophecy? “Behold, thy King cometh
to thee, meek, and riding on an ass, and a young colt;”<note n="2502" id="iii.LXIII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p30"><scripRef passage="Zech. ix. 9" id="iii.LXIII-p30.1" parsed="|Zech|9|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Zech.9.9">Zech. ix.
9</scripRef>.</p></note>not driving chariots, like the rest of the kings, not demanding
tributes, not thrusting men off, and leading about guards, but
displaying His great meekness even hereby.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p31">Ask then the Jew, what King came to Jerusalem borne on
an ass? Nay, he could not mention, but this alone.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p32">But He did these things, as I said, signifying
beforehand the things to come. For here the church is signified by the
colt, and the new people, which was once unclean, but which, after
Jesus sat on them, became clean. And see the image preserved
throughout. I mean that the disciples loose the asses. For by the
apostles, both they and we were called; by the apostles were we brought
near. But because our acceptance provoked them also to emulation,
therefore the ass appears following the colt. For after Christ hath sat
on the Gentiles, then shall they also come moving us to emulation.<note n="2503" id="iii.LXIII-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p33">Or, “emulating us,” <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXIII-p33.1">παραζηλοντε</span>
.</p></note> And Paul declaring this, said, “That blindness<note n="2504" id="iii.LXIII-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p34">[R.V., a hardening.]</p></note>in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be
come in; and so all Israel shall be saved.”<note n="2505" id="iii.LXIII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p35"><scripRef passage="Rom. xi. 25, 26" id="iii.LXIII-p35.1" parsed="|Rom|11|25|11|26" osisRef="Bible:Rom.11.25-Rom.11.26">Rom. xi.
25, 26</scripRef>.</p></note> For that it was a prophecy is evident from what is said. For neither
would the prophet have cared to express with such great exactness the
age of the ass, unless this had been so.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p36">But not these things only are signified by what is said,
but also that the apostles should bring them with ease. For as here, no
man gainsaid them so as to keep the asses, so neither with regard to
the Gentiles was any one able to prevent them, of those who were before
masters of them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p37">But He doth not sit on the bare colt, but on the
apostles’ garments. For after they had taken the colt, they then
gave up all, even as Paul also said, “I will very gladly spend
and be spent for your souls.”<note n="2506" id="iii.LXIII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p38"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xii. 15" id="iii.LXIII-p38.1" parsed="|2Cor|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.15">2 Cor. xii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p39">But mark how tractable the colt, how being unbroken, and
having never known the rein, he was not restive, but went on orderly;
which thing itself was a prophecy of the future, signifying the
submissiveness of the Gentiles, and their sudden conversion to good
order. For all things did that word work, which said, “Loose him,
and bring him to me:” so that the unmanageable became orderly,
and the unclean thenceforth clean.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p40">3. But see the baseness of the Jews. He had wrought so
many miracles, and never were they thus amazed at Him; but when they
saw a multitude running together, then they marvel. “For all the
city was moved, saying, Who is this? But the multitudes said, This is
Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.”<note n="2507" id="iii.LXIII-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p41"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 10, 11" id="iii.LXIII-p41.1" parsed="|Matt|21|10|21|11" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.10-Matt.21.11">Matt. xxi.

their thoughts earthly, and low, and dragging on the ground.<note n="2508" id="iii.LXIII-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p42"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXIII-p42.1">σεσυρμνη</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p43">But these things He did, not as displaying any pomp, but
at once, as I have said, both fulfilling a prophecy, and teaching
self-denial, and at the same time also comforting His disciples, who
were grieving for His death, and showing them that He suffers all these
things willingly. And mark thou, I pray thee, the accuracy of the
prophet, how he foretold all things. And some things David, some things
Zechariah, had proclaimed beforehand. Let us also do likewise, and let
us sing hymns, and give up our garments to them that bear Him. For what
should we deserve, when some clothe the ass on which He was set, and
others strew the garments even under her feet; but we, seeing him
naked, and not being even commanded to strip ourselves, but to spend of
what is laid by, not even so are liberal? And when they indeed attend
upon Him before and behind, but we, when He cometh unto us, send Him
away, and thrust Him off and insult Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p44">How sore a punishment do these things

<pb n="389" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_389.html" id="iii.LXIII-Page_389" />

deserve, how great vengeance! Thy Lord cometh
unto thee in need, and thou art not willing so much as to listen to His
entreaty, but thou blamest and rebukest Him, and this, when thou hast
heard such words as these. But if in giving one loaf, and a little
money, thou art so mean, and haughty, and backward; if thou hadst to
empty out all, what wouldest thou become?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p45">Seest thou not those that show their magnificence in the
theatre, how much they give away to the harlots? but thou givest not so
much as the half, nay often not the smallest part. But the devil is
exhorting to give to whom it may chance, procuring us hell, and thou
givest; but Christ to the needy, promising a kingdom, and thou, far
from giving, dost rather insult them, and thou choosest rather to obey
the devil, that thou mightest be punished, than to submit to Christ,
and be saved.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p46">And what could be worse than this frenzy? One procures
hell, the other a kingdom, and ye leave the latter, and run unto the
former. And this ye send away, when He cometh unto you, that when he is
far off, ye call unto you. And what you do is the same as if a king
bearing a royal robe, and offering a diadem, did not win your choice,
but a robber brandishing a sword at you, and threatening death, were to
win it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p47">Considering these things then, beloved, let us discern
the truth at length though late, and let us grow sober. For I am now
ashamed of speaking of almsgiving, because that having often spoken on
this subject, I have effected nothing worth the exhortation. For some
increase indeed hath there been, but not so much as I wished. For I see
you sowing, but not with a liberal hand. Wherefore I fear too lest ye
also “reap sparingly.”<note n="2509" id="iii.LXIII-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p48"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. ix. 6" id="iii.LXIII-p48.1" parsed="|2Cor|9|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.9.6">2 Cor. ix.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p49">For in proof that we do sow sparingly, let us inquire,
if it seem good, which<note n="2510" id="iii.LXIII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p50">[“who are more
numerous.”…“and who are they that are neither,”
etc.—R.]</p></note>are more numerous in the city, poor or rich; and which they, who are
neither<note n="2511" id="iii.LXIII-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p51">[“who are more
numerous.”…“and who are they that are neither,”
etc.—R.]</p></note>poor nor rich, but have a middle place. As, for instance, a tenth part
is of rich, and a tenth of the poor that have nothing at all, and the
rest of the middle sort.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p52">Let us distribute then amongst the poor the whole
multitude of the city, and ye will see the disgrace how great it is.
For the very rich indeed are but few, but those that come next to them
are many; again, the poor are much fewer than these. Nevertheless,
although there are so many that are able to feed the hungry, many go to
sleep in their hunger, not because those that have are not able with
ease to succor them, but because of their great barbarity and
inhumanity. For if both the wealthy, and those next to them, were to
distribute amongst themselves those who are in need of bread and
raiment, scarcely would one poor person fall to the share of fifty men
or even a hundred. Yet nevertheless, though in such great abundance of
persons to assist them, they are wailing every day. And that thou
mayest learn the inhumanity of the others, when the church is possessed
of a revenue of one of the lowest among the wealthy, and not of the
very rich, consider how many widows it succors every day, how many
virgins; for indeed the list of them hath already reached unto the
number of three thousand. Together with these, she succors them that
dwell in the prison, the sick in the caravansera, the healthy, those
that are absent from their home, those that are maimed in their bodies,
those that wait upon the altar; and with respect to food and raiment,
them that casually come every day; and her substance is in no respect
diminished. So that if ten men only were thus willing to spend, there
would be no poor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p53">4. And what, it will be said, are our children to
inherit? The principal remains, and the income again is become more
abundant, the goods being stored up for them in Heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p54">But are ye not willing to do this? At least do it by the
half, at least by the third part, at least by the fourth part, at least
by the tenth. For owing to God’s favor, it were possible for our
city to nourish the poor of ten cities.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p55">And if ye will, let us make some calculation<note n="2512" id="iii.LXIII-p55.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p56"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXIII-p56.1">συλλογισμν</span>
.</p></note>in proof of this; or rather there is no need so much as of reckoning;
for of itself the easiness of the thing is discernible. See at least,
upon public occasions, how much one house hath often not been backward
to spend, and hath not had so much as a little feeling of the expense,
which service if each of the rich were willing to perform for the poor,
in a brief moment of time he would have seized on Heaven.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p57">What plea then will there be? what shadow of defense,
when not even of the things from which we must assuredly be separated,
when taken away from hence, not even of these do we impart to the needy
with as much liberality as others to those on the stage, and this when
we are to reap so many benefits therefrom? For we ought indeed, even
though we were always to be here, not even so to be sparing of this
good expenditure; but when after a little time, we are to be removed
from

<pb n="390" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_390.html" id="iii.LXIII-Page_390" />

hence, and dragged away naked
from all, what kind of defense shall we have for not even out of our
income giving to the hungry and distressed?<note n="2513" id="iii.LXIII-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p58"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXIII-p58.1">ἀγχομνοι</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p59">For neither do I constrain thee to lessen thy
possessions, not because I do not wish it, but because I see thee very
backward. It is not then this I say, but spend of your fruits, and
treasure up nothing from these. It is enough for thee to have the money
of thine income pouring in on thee as from a fountain; make the poor
sharers with thee, and become a good steward of the things given thee
of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p60">But I pay tribute, one may say. For this cause then dost
thou despise, because in this case no one demands it of thee? And the
other, who, should the earth bear, or should it not bear, takes by
force, and extorts, thou darest not gainsay; but Him that is so mild,
and then only demands, when the earth bears, thou answerest not even to
a word? And who will deliver thee from those intolerable punishments?
There is no one. For if, because in the other case a very sore
punishment will ensue to thee for not giving, therefore thou becomest
diligent about the payment, consider here too is one more sore; not to
be bound, neither to be cast into prison, but to depart into the
eternal fire.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p61">For all reasons then let us pay these tributes first:
for great is the facility, and greater the reward; and more abundant
the gain, and worse the punishments to us if we are obstinate. For a
punishment cometh upon us, which hath no end.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p62">But if thou tell me of the soldier’s fighting for
thee with the barbarians, there is here too a camp, that of the poor,
and a war, which the poor are waging for thee. For when they receive,
by praying they make God propitious; and making Him propitious, they
repulse, instead of barbarians, the assaults of the devils; they suffer
not the evil one to be violent, neither to attack us continually, but
they relax his might.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p63">5. Seeing therefore these soldiers every day fighting in
thy behalf with the devil by their supplications and prayers, demand of
thyself this good contribution, their nourishment. For this King being
mild hath not assigned thee any to demand it of thee, but desires thou
shouldest give it willingly; though thou pay by little and little, He
receives it; though being in difficulty, thou shouldest pay after a
long time, He doth not press him that hath not.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p64">Let us not then despise His long-suffering; let us
treasure up for ourselves, not wrath, but salvation; not death, but
life; not punishment and vengeance, but honors and crowns. There is no
need in this case to pay a hire for the conveyance of the things
contributed; there is no need in this case to labor in turning them
into money. If thou givest them up, the Lord Himself removes them into
Heaven; He Himself makes the traffic the more gainful for thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p65">There is no need here to find one to carry in what thou
hast contributed; contribute only, and straightway it goeth up, not
that others may be maintained as soldiers, but that it may remain for
thee with great profit. For here<note n="2514" id="iii.LXIII-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p66">[The translation has been altered here to conform to
the use of “here” and “there” in the
original.—R.]</p></note>whatsoever thou mayest have given, it is not possible to recover; but
there thou wilt receive them again with much honor, and shalt gain
greater, and more spiritual gains. Here the gifts are a demand; there a
loan, and money at interest, and a debt.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p67">Yea farther, God hath given thee bonds. For “he
that showeth mercy to a poor man,” it is said, “lendeth to
the Lord.”<note n="2515" id="iii.LXIII-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIII-p68"><scripRef passage="Prov. xix. 17" id="iii.LXIII-p68.1" parsed="|Prov|19|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Prov.19.17">Prov. xix.
17</scripRef>.</p></note> He gave thee also an earnest, and bail, and this being God! What sort
of earnest? The things in the present life, the visible, the spiritual
things, the foretaste of the things to come.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p69">Why then dost thou delay, and why art thou backward,
having received so many things already, looking for so many things?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p70">For what thou hast received are these: He Himself made
thee a body, He Himself put in thee a soul, He honored with speech thee
alone of the things on the earth, He gave thee the use of all the
things that are seen, He bestowed on thee the knowledge of Himself, He
gave up His Son for thee, He gave thee a baptism full of so many good
things, He gave thee a holy table, He promised a kingdom, and the good
things that cannot be told.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p71">Having then received so many good things, having to
receive so many, again I say the same thing, art thou making petty
reckoning about perishing riches, and what excuse wilt thou have?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p72">But art thou looking altogether at thy children? and
dost draw back for the sake of these? Nay, rather teach them also to
gain such gains. For if thou hadst money lent out and bearing interest,
and thou hadst a grateful debtor, thou wouldest ten thousand times
rather choose instead of the gold to leave the bond to thy child, so
that he should have the large income from it, and not be constrained to
go about, and seek for others to borrow it.</p>

<pb n="391" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_391.html" id="iii.LXIII-Page_391" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p73">And now give this bond to thy children, and leave God a
debtor to them. Thou dost not sell thy lands, and give to thy children,
but leavest them, that the income may remain, and that they may have a
greater increase of riches from thence; but this bond, which is more
productive than any land or revenue, and bears so many fruits, this art
thou afraid to leave to them? What great folly must this be, and
frenzy. And this when thou knowest, that though thou shouldest leave it
to them, thou thyself also shall again take it away with thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIII-p74">Of this nature are the things spiritual; they have great
munificence. Let us not then be beggarly; neither be inhuman and savage
towards ourselves, but let us traffic in that good merchandise; that we
may both ourselves take it away with us when we depart, and leave it to
our own children, and attain to the good things to come, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be unto the
Father, together with the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and
ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

reply. For there He came at the very passover, but here much before.

marvelled at amongst all men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p9">And this is a heavier charge against the Jews, that when
He had done this not once only, but a second time, they continued in
their trafficking, and said that He was an adversary of God, when they
ought even from hence to have learnt His honor for His Father and His
own might. For indeed He also wrought miracles, and they saw His words
agreeing with His works.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p10">But not even so were they persuaded, but “were
sore displeased,” and this while they heard the prophet crying
aloud, and the children in a manner beyond their age proclaiming Him.
Wherefore also He Himself sets up Isaiah against them as an accuser,
saying, “My house shall be called a house of prayer.”<note n="2519" id="iii.LXIV-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p11"><scripRef passage="Is. lvi. 7" id="iii.LXIV-p11.1" parsed="|Isa|56|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.56.7">Is. lvi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p14">But they not even so would be persuaded, but together
with the rest of the miracles hearing even the children proclaiming,
were ready to choke, and say, “Hearest thou not what these
say?”<note n="2521" id="iii.LXIV-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p15"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 16" id="iii.LXIV-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|21|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.16">Matt. xxi.

“Hear ye not what these say?” for the children were singing
to Him as to God.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p16">What then saith He? Since they were speaking against
things manifest, He applies His correction more in the way of reproof,
saying, “Have ye never read, Out of the mouths of babes and
sucklings Thou hast perfected praise?” And well did He say,
“Out of the mouth.” For what was said was not of their
understanding, but of His power giving articulation to their tongue yet
immature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p17">And this was also a type of the Gentiles lisping, and
sounding forth at once great things with understanding and faith.</p>

<pb n="392" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_392.html" id="iii.LXIV-Page_392" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p18">And for the apostles also there was from hence no small
consolation. For that they might not be perplexed, how being unlearned
they should be able to publish the gospel, the children anticipate
them, and remove all their anxiety, teaching them, that He would grant
them utterance, who made even these to sing praises.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p19">And not so only, but the miracle showed that He is
Creator even of nature. The children then, although of age immature,
uttered things that had a clear meaning, and were in accordance with
those above, but the men things teeming with frenzy and madness. For
such is the nature of wickedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p20">Forasmuch then as there were many things to provoke
them, from the multitude, from the casting out of the sellers, from the
miracles, from the children, He again leaves them, giving room to the
swelling passion, and not willing to begin His teaching, lest boiling
with envy they should be the more displeased at His sayings.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p21">“Now in the morning as He returned into the city,
He was an hungered.”<note n="2522" id="iii.LXIV-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 18" id="iii.LXIV-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|21|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.18">Matt. xxi.

cited; “of figs” is applied here and below by the
translator.—R.]</p></note>but if it was not time, how doth the other evangelist say, “He
came, if haply He might find fruit thereon.” Whence it is
manifest that this belongs to the suspicion of His disciples, who were
yet in a somewhat imperfect state. For indeed the evangelists in many
places record the suspicions of the disciples.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p25">Like as this then was their suspicion, so also was it
too to suppose it was cursed for this cause, because of having no
fruit. Wherefore then was it cursed? For the disciples’ sakes,
that they might have confidence. For because everywhere He conferred
benefits, but punished no man; and it was needful that He should afford
them a demonstrative proof of His power to take vengeance also, that
both the disciples might learn, and the Jews, that being able to blast
them that crucify Him, of His own will He submits, and does not blast
them; and it was not His will to show forth this upon men; upon the
plant did He furnish the proof of His might in taking vengeance. But
when unto places, or unto plants, or unto brutes, any such thing as
this is done, be not curious, neither say, how was the fig-tree justly
dried up, if it was not the time <i>of figs</i>; for this it is the
utmost trifling to say; but behold the miracle, and admire and glorify
the worker thereof.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p26">Since in the case also of the swine that were drowned,
many have said this, working out the argument of justice; but neither
there should one give heed, for these again are brutes, even as that
was a plant without life.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p27">Wherefore then was the act invested with such an
appearance, and with this plea for a curse? As I said, this was the
disciple’s suspicion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p28">But if it was not yet time, vainly do some say the law
is here meant. For the fruit of this was faith, and then was the time
of this fruit, and it had indeed borne it; “For already<note n="2525" id="iii.LXIV-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p29"><scripRef passage="John iv. 35" id="iii.LXIV-p29.1" parsed="|John|4|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.35">John iv.

you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor.”<note n="2526" id="iii.LXIV-p29.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p30"><scripRef passage="John iv. 38" id="iii.LXIV-p30.1" parsed="|John|4|38|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.4.38">John iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p31">2. Not any therefore of these things doth He here
intimate, but it is what I said, He displays His power to punish, and
this is shown by saying, “The time was not yet,” making it
clear that of this special purpose He went, and not for hunger, but for
His disciples’ sake, who indeed marvelled exceedingly, although
many miracles had been done greater; but, as I said, this was strange,
for now first He showed forth His power to take vengeance. Wherefore
not in any other, but in the moistest of all planted things did He work
the miracle, so that hence also the miracle appeared greater.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p32">And that thou mightest learn, that for their sakes this
was done, that He might train them to feel confidence, hear what He
saith afterwards. But what saith He? “Ye also shall do greater
things, if ye are willing to believe and to be confident in
prayer.” Seest thou that all is done for their sake, so that they
might not be afraid and tremble at plots against them? Wherefore He
saith this a second time also, to make them cleave to prayer and faith.
“For not this only shall ye do, but also shall remove mountains;
and many more things shall ye do, being confident in faith and
prayer.”<note n="2527" id="iii.LXIV-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 21, 22" id="iii.LXIV-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|21|21|21|22" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.21-Matt.21.22">Matt. xxi.

forward against Him the correction of the traffickers in the temple.
And this in John also they appear to ask, although not in these words,
but with the same intent. For there too they say, “What sign
showest thou unto us? seeing that thou doest these things.”

But there He answers them, saying,
“Destroy this temple, and I in three days will raise it
up,”<note n="2529" id="iii.LXIV-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p36"><scripRef passage="John ii. 18, 19" id="iii.LXIV-p36.1" parsed="|John|2|18|2|19" osisRef="Bible:John.2.18-John.2.19">John ii.

that then indeed was the beginning and prelude of the miracles, but
here the end.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p37">But what they say is this: Hast thou received the
teacher’s chair? Hast thou been ordained a priest, that thou
didst display such authority? it is said. And yet He had done nothing
implying arrogance, but had been careful for the good order of the
temple, yet nevertheless having nothing to say, they object against
this. And indeed when He cast them out, they did not dare to say
anything, because of the miracles, but when He showed Himself, then
they find fault with Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p38">What then saith He? He doth not answer them directly, to
show that, if they had been willing to see His authority, they could;
but He asks them again, saying, “The baptism of John, whence is
it? From heaven, or of men?”<note n="2530" id="iii.LXIV-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 25" id="iii.LXIV-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|21|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.25">Matt. xxi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p40">And what sort of inference is this? The greatest surely.
For if they had said, from heaven, He would have said unto them, why
then did ye not believe him? For if they had believed, they would not
have asked these things. For of Him John had said, “I am not
worthy to loose the latchet of His shoe;” and, “Behold the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world;” and,
“This is the Son of God;”<note n="2531" id="iii.LXIV-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p41"><scripRef passage="John i. 27, 29, 34" id="iii.LXIV-p41.1" parsed="|John|1|27|0|0;|John|1|29|0|0;|John|1|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.1.27 Bible:John.1.29 Bible:John.1.34">John i. 27,

knowing by what authority Christ doeth these things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p44">After this, because they, dealing craftily, said,
“We know not,” He said not, neither know I, but what?
“Neither tell I you.”<note n="2534" id="iii.LXIV-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 27" id="iii.LXIV-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|21|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.27">Matt. xxi.

them to be instructed; but since they were dealing craftily with good

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p46">And how was it they did not say that the baptism was of
men? “They feared the people”<note n="2535" id="iii.LXIV-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p47"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 26" id="iii.LXIV-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|21|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.26">Matt. xxi.

and do all things for the sake of men. For this man too they feared for
their sakes not reverencing the saint<note n="2536" id="iii.LXIV-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p48"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXIV-p48.1">τν

their evils were engendered to them from hence.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p50">After this, He saith, “What think ye? A man had
two sons; and he saith to the first, go, work to-day in the vineyard.
But he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and
went. And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and
said, I go sir: and went not. Whether then of them twain did the will
of his father? They say, the first.”<note n="2538" id="iii.LXIV-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 28-31" id="iii.LXIV-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|21|28|21|31" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.28-Matt.21.31">Matt. xxi.
28–31</scripRef>. [There are a few
slight variations from the received text.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p52">Again He convicts them by a parable, intimating both
their unreasonable obstinacy, and the submissiveness of those who were
utterly condemned by them. For these two children declare what came to
pass with respect to both the Gentiles and the Jews. For the former not
having undertaken to obey, neither having become hearers of the law,
showed forth their obedience in their works; and the latter having
said, “All that the Lord shall speak, we will do, and will
hearken,”<note n="2539" id="iii.LXIV-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p53"><scripRef passage="Exod. xix. 8" id="iii.LXIV-p53.1" parsed="|Exod|19|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.19.8">Exod. xix.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>in their works were disobedient. And for this reason, let me add, that
they might not think the law would benefit them, He shows that this
self-same thing condemns them, like as Paul also saith, “Not the
hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall
be justified.”<note n="2540" id="iii.LXIV-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p54"><scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 13" id="iii.LXIV-p54.1" parsed="|Rom|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.13">Rom. ii.

the judgment to be delivered by themselves, like as He does also in the
ensuing parable of the vineyard.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p55">3. And that this might be done, He makes trial of the
accusation in the person of an other. For since they were not willing
to confess directly, He by a parable drives them on to what He
desired.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p56">But when, not understanding His sayings, they had
delivered the judgment, He unfolds His concealed meaning after this,
and saith, “Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of Heaven
before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
believed him not; but the publicans<note n="2541" id="iii.LXIV-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p57">[“and harlots” omitted here.]</p></note>believed him; and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterwards,
that ye might believe him.”<note n="2542" id="iii.LXIV-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p58"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 31, 32" id="iii.LXIV-p58.1" parsed="|Matt|21|31|21|32" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.31-Matt.21.32">Matt. xxi.
31, 32</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p59">For if He had said simply, harlots go before you, the
word would have seemed to them to be offensive; but now, being uttered
after their own judgment it appears to be not too hard.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p60">Therefore He adds also the accusation. What then is
this? “John came,” He saith, “unto you,” not
unto them, and not this only, but; also “in the way of
righteousness.” “For neither with this can ye find fault,
that he was

<pb n="394" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_394.html" id="iii.LXIV-Page_394" />

some careless one, and
of no profit; but both his life was irreprehensible, and his care for
you great, and ye gave no heed to him.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p61">And with this there is another charge also, that
publicans gave heed; and with this, again another, that “not even
after them did ye. For ye should have done so even before them, but not
to do it even after them was to be deprived of all excuse;” and
unspeakable was both the praise of the one, and the charge against the
other. “To you he came, and ye accepted him not; he came not to
them, and they receive him, and not even them did ye take for
instructors.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p62">See by how many things is shown the commendation of
those, and the charge against these. To you he came, not to them. Ye
believed not, this offended not them. They believed, this profited not
you.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p63">But the word, “go before you,” is not as
though these were following, but as having a hope, if they were
willing. For nothing, so much as jealousy, rouses the grosser sort.
Therefore He is ever saying, “The first shall be last, and the
last first.” Therefore He brought in both harlots and publicans,
that they might provoke them to jealousy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p64">For these two indeed are chief sins, engendered of
violent lust, the one of sexual desire, the other of the desire of
money. And He indicates that this especially was hearing the law of
God, to believe John. For it was not of grace only, that harlots
entered in, but also of righteousness. For not, as continuing harlots,
did they enter in, but having obeyed and believed, and having been
purified and converted, so did they enter in.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p65">Seest thou how He rendered His discourse less offensive,
and more penetrating, by the parable, by His bringing in the harlots?
For neither did He say at once, wherefore believed ye not John? but
what was much more pricking, when, He had put forward the publicans and
the harlots, then He added this, by the order of their actions
convicting their unpardonable conduct, and showing that for fear of men
they do all things, and for vainglory. For they did not confess Christ
for fear, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; and again, of
John they dared not speak evil, and not even this from reverence, but
for fear. All which things He convicted by His sayings, and with more
severity afterwards did He go on to inflict the blow, saying,
“But ye, when ye knew it, repented not afterwards, that ye might
believe him.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p66">For an evil thing it is not at the first to choose the
good, but it is a heavier charge not even to be brought round. For this
above all maketh many wicked, which I see to be the case with some now
from extreme insensibility.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p67">But let no one be like this; but though he be sunk down
to the extremity of wickedness, let him not despair of the change for
the better. For it is an easy thing to rise up out of the very abysses
of wickedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p68">Heard ye not how that harlot, that went beyond all in
lasciviousness, outshone all in godly reverence. Not the harlot in the
gospels do I mean, but the one in our generation, who came from
Phœnice, that most lawless city. For she was once a harlot among
us, having the first honors on the stage, and great was her name
everywhere, not in our city only, but even as far as the Cilicians and
Cappadocians. And many estates did she ruin, and many orphans did she
overthrow; and many accused her of sorcery also, as weaving such toils
not by her beauty of person only, but also by her drugs. This harlot
once won even the brother of the empress, for mighty indeed was her
tyranny.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p69">But all at once, I know not how, or rather I do know
well, for it was being so minded, and converting, and bringing down
upon herself God’s grace, she despised all those things, and
having cast away the arts of the devils, mounted up to heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p70">And indeed nothing was more vile than she was, when she
was on the stage; nevertheless, afterwards she outwent many in
exceeding continence, and having clad herself with sackcloth, all her
time she thus disciplined herself. On the account of this woman both
the governor was stirred up, and soldiers armed, yet they had not
strength to carry her off to the stage, nor to lead her away from the
virgins that had received her.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p71">This woman having been counted worthy of the unutterable
mysteries, and having exhibited a diligence proportionate to the grace
(given her) so ended her life, having washed off all through grace, and
after her baptism having shown forth much self-restraint. For not even
a mere sight of herself did she allow to those who were once her
lovers, when they had come for this, having shut herself up, and having
passed many years, as it were, in a prison. Thus “shall the last
be first, and the first last;” thus do we in every case need a
fervent soul, and there is nothing to hinder one from becoming great
and admirable:</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p72">4. Let no man then of them that live in vice despair;
let no man who lives in virtue slumber. Let neither this last be
confident, for often the harlot will pass him by; nor let the other
despair, for it is possible for him to pass by even the first.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p73">Hear what God saith unto Jerusalem, “I

<pb n="395" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_395.html" id="iii.LXIV-Page_395" />

whoredoms, Turn thou unto me, and she returned not.”<note n="2543" id="iii.LXIV-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p74"><scripRef passage="Jer. iii. 7" id="iii.LXIV-p74.1" parsed="|Jer|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.3.7">Jer. iii.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> When we have come back unto the earnest love of God, He remembers not
the former things. God is not as man, for He reproaches us not with the
past, neither doth He say, Why wast thou absent so long a time? when we
repent; only let us approach Him as we ought. Let us cleave to Him
earnestly, and rivet our hearts to His fear.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p75">Such things have been done not under the new covenant
only, but even under the old. For what was worse than Manasseh? but he
was able to appease God. What more blessed than Solomon? but when he
slumbered, he fell. Or rather I can show even both things to have taken
place in one, in the father of this man, for he the same person became
at different times both good and bad. What more blessed than Judas? but
he became a traitor. What more wretched than Matthew? but he became an
evangelist. What worse than Paul? but he became an apostle. What more
to be envied than Simon? but he became even himself the most wretched
of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p76">How many other such changes wouldest thou see, both to
have taken place of old, and now taking place every day? For this
reason then I say, Neither let him on the stave despair, nor let him in
the church be confident. For to this last it is said, “Let him
that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall;”<note n="2544" id="iii.LXIV-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p77"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 12" id="iii.LXIV-p77.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.12">1 Cor. x.

Again, to these He saith, “Watch;” but to those,

dead.”<note n="2547" id="iii.LXIV-p79.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p80"><scripRef passage="Eph. v. 14" id="iii.LXIV-p80.1" parsed="|Eph|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eph.5.14">Eph. v.

For these need to preserve what they have, and those to become what
they are not; these to preserve their health, those to be delivered
from their infirmity, for they are sick; but many even of the sick
become healthy, and of the healthy many by remissness grow infirm.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p81">To the one then He saith, “Behold, thou art made
whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee;”<note n="2548" id="iii.LXIV-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p82"><scripRef passage="John v. 14" id="iii.LXIV-p82.1" parsed="|John|5|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.14">John v.

but also somewhat else more grievous. For such a one is not only in
inactivity as to good works, but also in the active doing of evil
works. But nevertheless, though thou be so disposed, and be willing to
rouse thyself a little, all the terrors are at an end.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p84">Though thou hast been so “thirty and eight
years,” and art earnest to become whole, there is no one to
hinder thee. Christ is present now also, and saith, “Take up thy
bed,” only be willing to rouse thyself, despair not. Hast thou no
man? but thou hast God. Hast thou no one to put thee into the pool? but
thou hast Him who suffers thee not to need the pool. Hast thou had no
one to cast thee in there? but thou hast Him that commands thee to take
up thy bed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p85">Thou mayest not say, “While I am coming, another
steppeth down before me.”<note n="2550" id="iii.LXIV-p85.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p86"><scripRef passage="John v. 7" id="iii.LXIV-p86.1" parsed="|John|5|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.5.7">John v.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> For if it be thy will to go down into the fountain, there is none to
hinder thee. Grace is not consumed, is not spent, it is a kind of
fountain springing up constantly; by His fullness are we all healed
both soul and body. Let us come unto it then even now. For Rahab also
was a harlot, yet was she saved; and the thief was a murderer, yet he
became a citizen of paradise; and while Judas being with his Master
perished, the thief being on a cross became a disciple. Such are the
wonderful works of God. Thus the magi approved themselves, thus the
publican became an evangelist, thus the blasphemer an apostle.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p87">5. Look at these things, and never despair, but be ever
confident, and rouse thyself. Lay hold only on the way that leads
thither, and thou wilt advance quickly. Shut not up the doors, close
not up the entrance. Short is the present life, small the labor. But
though it were great, not even so ought one to decline it. For if thou
toil not at this most glorious toil that is spent upon repentance and
virtue, in the world thou wilt assuredly toil and weary thyself in
other ways. But if both in the one and the other there be labor, why do
we not choose that which hath its fruit abundant, and its recompense
greater.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p88">Yet neither is this labor and that the same. For in
worldly pursuits are continual perils, and losses one upon another, and
the hope uncertain; great is the servility, and the expenditure alike
of wealth, and of bodies, and of souls; and then the return of the
fruits is far below our expectation, if perchance it should grow
up.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p89">For neither doth toil upon worldly matters everywhere
bear fruit; nay but even, when it hath not failed, but has brought
forth its produce even abundantly, short is the time wherein it
continues.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p90">For when thou art grown old, and hast no longer after
that the feeling of enjoyment in perfection, then and not till then
doth the labor bear thee its recompense. And whereas the labor was with
the body in its vigor, the

<pb n="396" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_396.html" id="iii.LXIV-Page_396" />

fruit
and the enjoyment is with one grown old and languid, when time has
dulled even the feeling, although if it had not dulled it, the
expectation of the end suffers us not to find pleasure.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p91">But in the other case not so, but the labor is in
corruption and a dying body, but the crown in one incorruptible, and
immortal, and having no end. And the labor is both first and
short-lived; but the reward both subsequent and endless, that with
security thou mayest take thy rest after that, looking for nothing
unpleasant.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p92">For neither mayest thou fear change any more or loss as
here. What sort of good things, then, are these, which are both
insecure, and short-lived, and earthly, and vanishing before they have
appeared, and acquired with many toils? And what good things are equal
to those, that are immovable, that grow not old, that have no toil,
that even at the time of the conflicts bring thee crowns?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p93">For he that despises money even here already receives
his reward, being freed from anxiety, from rivalry, from false
accusation, from plotting from envy. He that is temperate, and lives
orderly, even before his departure, is crowned and lives in pleasure,
being delivered from unseemliness, ridicule, dangers of
accusation,<note n="2551" id="iii.LXIV-p93.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIV-p94">[The rendering above has been corrected to conform
to the punctuation of the Greek text.—R.]</p></note>and the other things that are to be feared. All the remaining parts of
virtue likewise make us a return here already.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIV-p95">In order therefore that we may attain unto both the
present and the future blessings, let us flee from vice and choose
virtue. For thus shall we both enjoy delight, and obtain the crowns to
come, unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might
forever and ever. Amen.</p>

householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and
digged a winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,
and went into a far country.</i><note n="2552" id="iii.LXV-p3.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p4">[R.V., “another country.”]</p></note><i>And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to
receive the fruits. And the husbandmen took the servants, and beat
some, and killed some, and stoned some. Again he sent other servants
more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. But last he sent
unto them his son, saying, It may be they will reverence my son. But
when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is
the heir, come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
And they cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When the Lord
therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?
They say unto Him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will
let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, which shall render him the
fruits in their seasons. Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in
the Scriptures, The Stone which the builders rejected, the same is
become the head of the corner?”</i><note n="2553" id="iii.LXV-p4.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p5">[The

<p class="c12" id="iii.LXV-p6"><span class="c11" id="iii.LXV-p6.1">Many</span> things doth He intimate by
this parable, God’s providence, which had been exercised towards
them from the first; their murderous disposition from the beginning;
that nothing had been omitted of whatever pertained to a heedful care
of them; that even when prophets had been slain, He had not turned away
from them, but had sent His very Son; that the God both of the New and

<pb n="397" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_397.html" id="iii.LXV-Page_397" />

of the Old Testament was one and
the same; that His death should effect great blessings; that they were
to endure extreme punishment for the crucifixion, and their crime; the
calling of the Gentiles, the casting out of the Jews.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p7">Therefore He putteth it after the former parable, that
He may show even hereby the charge to be greater, and highly
unpardonable. How, and in what way? That although they met with so much
care, they were worse than harlots and publicans, and by so much.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p8">And observe also both His great care, and the excessive
idleness of these men. For what pertained to the husbandmen, He Himself
did, the hedging it round about, the planting the vineyard, and all the
rest, and He left little for them to do; to take care of what was
there, and to preserve what was given to them. For nothing was left
undone, but all accomplished; and not even so did they gain, and this,
when they had enjoyed such great blessings from Him. For when they had
come forth out of Egypt, He gave a law, and set up a city, and built a
temple, and prepared an altar.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p9">“And went into a far country;” that is, He
bore long with them, not always bringing the punishments close upon
their sins; for by His going into a far country,<note n="2554" id="iii.LXV-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p10">[The verb <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXV-p10.1">ἀπεδμησε</span> means
“went into another country.” But Chrysostom here speaks of
the <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXV-p10.2">ἀποδημαν</span> as <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXV-p10.3">τν πολλν, thus</span> agreeing with the interpretation of the
A.V.—R.]</p></note> He means His great long-suffering.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p11">And “He sent His servants,” that is, the
prophets, “to receive the fruit;” that is, their obedience,
the proof of it by their works. But they even here showed their
wickedness, not only by failing to give the fruit, after having enjoyed
so much care, which was the sign of idleness, but also by showing anger
towards them that came. For they that had not to give when they owed,
should not have been indignant, nor angry, but should have entreated.
But they not only were indignant, but even filled their hands with
blood, and while deserving punishment, themselves inflicted
punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p12">Therefore He sent both a second, and a third company,
both that the wickedness of these might be shown, and the love towards
man of Him who sent them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p13">And wherefore sent He not His Son immediately? In order
that they might condemn themselves for the things done to the others,
and leave off their wrath, and reverence Him when He came. There are
also other reasons, but for the present let us go on to what is next.
But what means, “It may be they will reverence?” It is not
the language of one ignorant, away with the thought! but of one
desiring to show the sin to be great; and without any excuse. Since
Himself knowing that they would slay Him, He sent Him. But He saith,
“They will reverence,” declaring what ought to have been
done, that it was their duty to have reverenced Him. Since elsewhere
also He saith, “if perchance they will hear;”<note n="2555" id="iii.LXV-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p14"><scripRef passage="Ezek. ii. 5" id="iii.LXV-p14.1" parsed="|Ezek|2|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.2.5">Ezek. ii.
5</scripRef>.</p></note>not in this case either being ignorant, but lest any of the obstinate
should say, that His prediction was the thing that necessitated their
disobedience, therefore He frames His expressions in this way, saying,
“Whether they will,” and, “It may be.” For
though they had been obstinate towards His servants, yet ought they to
have reverenced the dignity of the Son.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p15">What then do these? When they ought to have run unto
Him, when they ought to have asked pardon for their offenses, they even
persist more strongly in their former sins, they proceed to add unto
their pollutions, forever throwing into the shade their former offenses
by their later; as also He Himself declared when He said, “Fill
ye up the measure of your fathers.”<note n="2556" id="iii.LXV-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p16"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 32" id="iii.LXV-p16.1" parsed="|Matt|23|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.32">Matt.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p20">But they did not learn self-restraint, albeit they
received this commandment first, “Thou shalt not kill;” and
had been commanded to abstain from countless other things because of
this, and by many and various means urged to the keeping of this
commandment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p21">Yet, for all that, they put not away that evil custom;
but what say they, when they saw Him? Come, let us kill Him. With what
motive, and for what reason? what of any kind had they to lay to His
charge, either small or great? Is it that He honored you, and being God
became man for your sakes, and wrought His countless miracles? or that
He pardoned your sins? or that He called you unto a kingdom?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p22">But see together with their impiety great was their
folly, and the reason of His murder was full of much madness.
“For let us kill Him,” it is said, “and the
inheritance shall be ours.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p23">And where do they take counsel to kill Him? “Out
of the vineyard.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p24">2. Seest thou how He prophesies even the place where He
was to be slain. “And they cast Him out, and slew Him.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p25">And Luke indeed saith, that He declared what these men
should suffer; and they said, “God forbid;” and He added
the testimony [of Scripture]. For “He beheld them, and said, What
is it then that is written? The stone which the builders rejected, the
same is become the head of the corner; and every one that falleth upon
it shall be broken.”<note n="2560" id="iii.LXV-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p26"><scripRef passage="Luke xx. 17, 18" id="iii.LXV-p26.1" parsed="|Luke|20|17|20|18" osisRef="Bible:Luke.20.17-Luke.20.18">Luke xx.
17, 18</scripRef>.</p></note> But Matthew, that they themselves delivered the sentence. But this is
not a contradiction. For indeed both things were done, both themselves
passed the sentence against themselves; and again, when they perceived
what they had said, they added, “God forbid;” and He set up
the prophet against them, persuading them that certainly this would
be.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p27">Nevertheless, not even so did He plainly reveal the
Gentiles, that He might afford them no handle, but signified it darkly
by saying, “He will give the vineyard to others.” For this
purpose then did He speak by a parable, that themselves might pass the
sentence, which was done in the case of David also, when He passed
judgment on the parable of Nathan. But do thou mark, I pray thee, even
hereby how just is the sentence, when the very persons that are to be
punished condemn themselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p28">Then that they might learn that not only the nature of
justice requires these things, but even from the beginning the grace of
the Spirit had foretold them, and God had so decreed, He both added a
prophecy, and reproves them in a way to put them to shame, saying,
“Did ye never read, The stone which the builders rejected, the
same is become the head of the corner? this is the Lord’s doing,
and it is marvellous in our eyes;” by all things showing, that
they should be cast out for unbelief, and the Gentiles brought in. This
He darkly intimated by the Canaanitish woman also; this again by the
ass, and by the centurion, and by many other parables; this also
now.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p29">Wherefore He added too, “This is the Lord’s
doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes,” declaring beforehand
that the believing Gentiles, and as many of the Jews as should also
themselves believe, shall be one, although the difference between them
had been so great before.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p30">Then, that they might learn that nothing was opposed to
God’s will of the things doing, but that the event was even
highly acceptable, and beyond expectation, and amazing every one of the
beholders (for indeed the miracle was far beyond words), He added and
said, “It is the Lord’s doing.” And by the stone He
means Himself, and by builders the teachers of the Jews; as Ezekiel
also saith, “They that build the wall, and daub it with
untempered mortar.”<note n="2561" id="iii.LXV-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p31"><scripRef passage="Ezek. xiii. 10" id="iii.LXV-p31.1" parsed="|Ezek|13|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ezek.13.10">Ezek. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p35">Then, that they might know that the penalty is not
limited to their being cast out, He added the punishments also, saying,
“Every one that falleth on this stone, shall be broken; but upon
whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.”<note n="2565" id="iii.LXV-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p36">[R.V., “scatter him as dust.” Chrysostom

part of Matthew’s account; but as he has just cited the parallel
passage in Luke (where this occurs), it is not certain that he refers
to Matthew’s here.—R.]</p></note> He speaks here of two ways of destruction, one from stumbling and being
offended; for this is, “Whosoever falleth on this stone:”
but another from their capture, and calamity, and utter destruction,
which also He clearly foretold, saying, “It will grind him to
powder.” By these words He darkly intimated His own resurrection
also.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p37">Now the Prophet Isaiah saith, that He blames the
vineyard, but here He accuses in particular the rulers of the people.

all things, they requited it by the contraries; but here He expresses
it with yet greater force. For He doth not plead, Himself, saying,
“What ought I to have done that I have not done?” but
brings in themselves to judge, that nothing hath been wanting, and to
condemn themselves. For when they say, “He will miserably destroy
those wicked men, and will let out the vineyard to other
husbandmen,” they say nothing else than this, publishing their
sentence with much greater force.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p41">With this Stephen also upbraids them, which thing most
of all stung them, that having enjoyed always much providential care,
they requited their benefactor with the contraries, which very thing
itself was a very great sign, that not the punisher, but the punished,
were the cause of the vengeance brought upon them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p42">This here likewise is shown, by the parable, by the
prophecy. For neither was He

<pb n="399" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_399.html" id="iii.LXV-Page_399" />

satisfied with a parable only, but added also a twofold
prophecy, one David’s, the others from Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p43">What then ought they to have done on hearing these
things? ought they not to have adored, to have marvelled at the tender
care, that shown before, that afterwards? But if by none of these
things they were made better, by the fear of punishment at any rate
ought they not to have been rendered more temperate?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p44">But they did not become so, but what do they after these
things? “When they had heard it,” it is said, “they
perceived that He spake of them. And when they sought to lay hands on
Him, they were afraid because of the multitudes, for they took Him for
a prophet.”<note n="2569" id="iii.LXV-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 45, 46" id="iii.LXV-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|21|45|21|46" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.45-Matt.21.46">Matt. xxi.

indeed, when being seized, He withdraws through the midst of them, and
is not seen; and sometimes while appearing to them He lays a check upon
their laboring eagerness; at which indeed men marveled, and said,
“Is not this Jesus? Lo, He speaketh boldly, and they say nothing
unto Him.”<note n="2570" id="iii.LXV-p45.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p46">[<scripRef passage="John vii. 25, 26" id="iii.LXV-p46.1" parsed="|John|7|25|7|26" osisRef="Bible:John.7.25-John.7.26">John vii.

fear of the multitude, He is satisfied with this, and doth not work
miracles, as before, withdrawing through the midst, and not appearing.
For it was not His desire to do all things in a superhuman way, in
order that the Dispensation<note n="2571" id="iii.LXV-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p47">Gr. <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXV-p47.1">οκονομα</span>, <i>i.e</i>.,
the verity of the Incarnation.</p></note>might be believed.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p48">But they, neither by the multitude, nor by what had been
said, were brought to a sound mind; they regarded not the
prophet’s testimony, nor their own sentence, nor the disposition
of the people; so entirely had the love of power and the lust of
vainglory blinded them, together with the pursuit of things
temporal.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p49">3. For nothing so urges men headlong and drives them
down precipices, nothing so makes them fail of the things to come, as
their being riveted to these decaying things. Nothing so surely makes
them enjoy both the one and the other, as their esteeming the things to

kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto
you.”<note n="2572" id="iii.LXV-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p50"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 33" id="iii.LXV-p50.1" parsed="|Matt|6|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.33">Matt. vi.

we to aim at them. But now in obtaining the others, we may obtain these
two; and not even so are some persuaded, but are like senseless stones,
and pursue shadows of pleasure. For what is pleasant of the things in
this present life? what is delightful? For with greater freedom do I
desire to discourse with you to-day; but suffer it, that ye may learn
that this life which seems to you to be a galling and wearisome life, I
mean that of the monks and of them that are crucified, is far sweeter,
and more to be desired than that which seems to be easy, and more
delicate.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p51">And of this ye are witnesses, who often have asked for
death, in the reverses and despondencies that have overtaken you, and
have accounted happy them that are in mountains, them that are in
caves, them that have not married, them that live the unworldly life;
ye that are engaged in crafts, ye that are in military services, ye
that live without object or rules, and pass your days at the theatres
and orchestras. For of these, although numberless fountains of
pleasures and mirth seem to spring up, yet are countless darts still
more bitter brought forth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p52">For if any one be seized with a passion for one of the
damsels that dance there, beyond ten thousand marches, beyond ten
thousand journeys from home, will he undergo a torture more grievous,
being in a more miserable state than any besieged city.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p53">However, not to inquire into those things for the
present, having left them to the conscience of those that have been
taken captive, come let us discourse of the life of the common sort of
men, and we shall find the difference between either of these kinds of
life as great as between a harbor, and a sea continually beaten about
with winds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p54">And observe from their retreats at once the first signs
of their tranquillity. For they have fled from market places, and
cities, and the tumults amidst men, and have chosen the life in
mountains, that which hath nothing in common with the things present,
that which undergoes none of the ills of man, no worldly sorrows, no
grief, no care so great, no dangers, no plots, no envy, no jealousy, no
lawless lusts, nor any other thing of this kind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p55">Here already they meditate upon the things of the
kingdom, holding converse with groves, and mountains, and springs, and
with great quietness, and solitude, and before all these, with God. And
from all turmoil is their cell pure, and from every passion and disease
is their soul free, refined and light, and far purer than the finest
air.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p56">And their work is what was Adam’s also at the
beginning and before his sin, when he was clothed with the glory, and
conversed freely with God, and dwelt in that place that was

<pb n="400" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_400.html" id="iii.LXV-Page_400" />

full of great blessedness. For in what
respect are they in a worse state than he, when before his disobedience
he was set to till the garden? Had he no worldly care? But neither have
these. Did he talk to God with a pure conscience? this also do these;
or rather they have a greater confidence than he, inasmuch as they
enjoy even greater grace by the supply of the Spirit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p57">Now ye ought indeed by the sight to take in these
things; but forasmuch as ye are not willing, but pass your time in
turmoils and in markets, by word at least let us teach you, taking one
part of their way of living (for it is not possible to go over their
whole life). These that are the lights of the world, as soon as the sun
is up, or rather even long before its rise, rise up from their bed,
healthy, and wakeful, and sober (for neither doth any sorrow and care,
nor headache, and toil, and multitude of business, nor any other such
thing trouble them, but as angels live they in Heaven); having risen
then straightway from their bed cheerful and glad, and having made one
choir, with their conscience bright, with one voice all, like as out of
one mouth, they sing hymns unto the God of all, honoring Him and
thanking Him for all His benefits, both particular, and common.<note n="2573" id="iii.LXV-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p58">“For all Thy goodness and loving kindness

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p59">So that if it seem good, let us leave Adam, and inquire

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p61">And their dress is suitable to their manliness. For not
indeed, like those with trailing garments, the enervated and mincing,
are they dressed, but like those blessed angels, Elijah, Elisha, John,
like the apostles; their garments being made for them, for some of
goat’s hair, for some of camel’s hair, and there are some
for whom skins suffice alone, and these long worn.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p62">Then, after they have said those songs, they bow their
knees, and entreat the God who was the object of their hymns for
things, to the very thought of which some do not easily arrive. For
they ask nothing of things present, for they have no regard for these,
but that they may stand with boldness before the fearful judgment-seat,
when the Only-Begotten Son of God is come to judge quick and dead, and
that no one may hear the fearful voice that saith, “I know you
not,” and that with a pure conscience and many good deeds they
may pass through this toilsome life, and sail over the angry sea with a
favorable wind. And he leads them in their prayers, who is their
Father, and their ruler.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p63">After this, when they have risen up and finished those
holy and continual prayers, the sun being risen, they depart each one
to their work, gathering thence a large supply for the needy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p64">4. Where now are they who give themselves to devilish
choirs, and harlot’s songs, and sit in theatres? For I am indeed
ashamed to make mention of them; nevertheless, because of your
infirmity it is needful to do even this. For Paul too saith,
“Like as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness,
even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
holiness.”<note n="2575" id="iii.LXV-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p65"><scripRef passage="Rom. vi. 19" id="iii.LXV-p65.1" parsed="|Rom|6|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.6.19">Rom. vi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p66">Come let us also therefore compare the company that is
made up of harlot women, and prostituted youths on the stage, and this
same that consists of these blessed ones in regard of pleasure, for
which most of all, many of the careless youths are taken in their
snares. For we shall find the difference as great as if any one heard
angels singing above that all-harmonious melody of theirs, and dogs and
swine howling and grunting on the dunghill. For by the mouths of these
Christ speaketh, by their tongues<note n="2576" id="iii.LXV-p66.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p67">[“by the tongues of those;” there being
a contrast in the Greek, which is obscured in the English
rendering.—R.]</p></note>the devil.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p68">But is the sound of pipes joined to them with unmeaning
noise, and unpleasing show, when cheeks are puffed out, and their
strings stretched to breaking? But here the grace of the Spirit pours
forth a sound, using, instead of flute or lyre or pipes, the lips of
the saints.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p69">Or rather, whatever we may say, it is not possible to
set forth the pleasure thereof, because of them that are riveted to
their clay, and their brick-making? Therefore I would even wish to take
one of those who are mad about these matters, and to lead him off
there, and to show him the choir of those saints, and I should have no
more need for these words. Nevertheless, though we speak unto miry
ones, we will try, though by word, still by little and little, to draw
them out of the slime and the fens. For there the hearer receives
straightway the fire of illicit love; for as though the sight of the
harlot were not enough to set the mind on fire, they add the mischief
also from the voice; but here even should the soul have any such thing,
it lays it aside straightway. But not their voice only, nor their
countenance, but even their clothes do more than these confound the
beholders. And should it be some poor man

<pb n="401" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_401.html" id="iii.LXV-Page_401" />

of the grosser and heedless sort, from the
sight he will cry out ten thousand times in bitter despair, and will
say to himself, “The harlot, and the prostituted boy, children of
cooks and cobblers, and often even of slaves live in such delicacy, and
I a freeman, and born of freemen, choosing honest labor, am not able so
much as to imagine these things in a dream;” and thus he will go
his way inflamed with discontent.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p70">But in the case of the monks there is no such result,
but rather the contrary altogether. For when he shall see children of
rich men and descendants of illustrious ancestors clothed in such
garments as not even the lowest of the poor, and rejoicing in this,
consider how great a consolation against poverty he will receive as he
goes away. And should he be rich, he returns sobered, become a better
man. Again in the theatre, when they see the harlot clothed with golden
ornaments, while the poor man will lament, and bemoan, seeing his own
wife having nothing of the kind, the rich will in consequence of this
spectacle contemn and despise the partners of their home. For when the
harlot present to the beholders garb and look, and voice and step, all
luxurious, they depart set on fire, and enter into their own houses,
thenceforth captives.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p71">Hence the insults, and the affronts, hence the enmities,
the wars, the daily deaths; hence to them that are taken captive, life
is insupportable, and the partner of their home thenceforth unpleasing,
and their children not as much objects of affection, and all things in
their houses turned upside down, and after that they seem to be thrown
into disorder by the very sunbeam.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p72">But not from these choirs does any such dissatisfaction
arise, but the wife will receive her husband quiet and meek, freed from
all unlawful lust, and will find him more gentle to her than before
this. Such evil things doth that choir bring forth, but this good
things, the one making wolves of sheep, this lambs of wolves. But as
yet we have perhaps said nothing hitherto touching the pleasure.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p73">And what could be more pleasant than not to be troubled
or grieved in mind, neither to despond and groan? Nevertheless, let us
carry on our discourse still further, and examine the enjoyment of
either kind of song and spectacle; and we shall see the one indeed
continuing until evening, so long as the spectator sits in the theatre,
but after this paining him more grievously than any sting; but in the
other case forever vigorous in the souls of them that have beheld it.
For as well the fashion of the men, and the delightfulness of the
place, and the sweetness of their manner of life, and the purity, of
their rule, and the grace of that most beautiful and spiritual song
they have for ever infixed in them. They at least who are in continual
enjoyment of those havens, thenceforth flee as from a tempest, from the
tumults of the multitude.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p74">But not when singing only, and praying, but also when
riveted to their books, they are a pleasing spectacle to the beholders.
For after they have ended the choir, one takes Isaiah and discourses
with him, another converses with the apostles, and another goes over
the labors of other men, and seeks wisdom concerning God, concerning
this universe, concerning the things that are seen, concerning the
things that are not seen, concerning the objects of sense, and the
objects of intellect, concerning the vileness of this present life, and
the greatness of that to come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p75">5. And they are fed on a food most excellent, not
setting before themselves cooked flesh of beasts; but oracles of God,
beyond honey and the honey comb, a honey marvellous, and far superior
to that whereon John fed of old in the wilderness. For this honey no
wild bees collect, settling on the flowers, neither do lay it up in
hives digesting the dew, but the grace of the Spirit forming it, layeth
it up in the souls of the saints, in the place of honeycombs, and
hives, and pipes, so that he that will may eat thereof continually in
security. These bees then they also imitate, and hover around the
honeycombs of those holy books, reaping therefrom great pleasure.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p76">And if thou desirest to learn about their table, be near
it, and thou shalt see them bursting forth<note n="2577" id="iii.LXV-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p77"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXV-p77.1">ἐρευγομνου</span>
.</p></note>with such things, all gentle and sweet, and full of a spiritual
fragrance. No foul word can those spiritual mouths bring forth, nothing
of foolish jesting, nothing harsh, but all worthy of Heaven. One would
not be wrong in comparing the mouths of them that crawl about in the
market places, and are mad after worldly things, to ditches of some
mire; but the lips of these to fountains flowing with honey, and
pouring forth pure streams.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p78">But if any felt displeased that I have called the mouths
of the multitude ditches of some mire, let him know that I have said
it, sparing them very much. For Scripture hath not used this measure,
but a comparison far stronger. “For adder’s poison,”
it is said, “is under their lips,<note n="2578" id="iii.LXV-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p79"><scripRef passage="Psa. 140.3; 5.9" id="iii.LXV-p79.1" parsed="|Ps|140|3|0|0;|Ps|5|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.140.3 Bible:Ps.5.9">Ps. cxl. 3 and v. 9</scripRef>.</p></note>and their throat is an open sepulchre.” But theirs are not so,
but full of much fragrance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p80">And their state here is like this, but that hereafter
what speech can set before us? what thought shall conceive? the portion
of angels, the blessedness unspeakable, the good things untold?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p81">Perchance some are warmed now, and have been moved to a
longing after this good rule of life. But what is the profit, when
whilst ye are here only, ye have this fire; but when ye have gone
forth, ye extinguish the flame, and this desire fades. How then, in
order that this may not be? While this desire is warm in you, go your
way unto those angels, kindle it more. For the account that we give
will not be able to set thee on fire, like as the sight of the things.
Say not, I will speak with my wife, and I will settle my affairs first.
This delay is the beginning of remissness. Hear, how one desired to bid
farewell to them at his house,<note n="2579" id="iii.LXV-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p82"><scripRef passage="1 Kings xix. 20" id="iii.LXV-p82.1" parsed="|1Kgs|19|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Kgs.19.20">1 Kings

The disciple desired to bury his father,<note n="2580" id="iii.LXV-p82.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p83"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 21-22" id="iii.LXV-p83.1" parsed="|Matt|8|21|8|22" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.21-Matt.8.22">Matt. viii.
21–22</scripRef>.</p></note>and Christ allowed not so much as this. And yet what thing seems to
thee to be so necessary as the funeral of a father? but not even this
did He permit.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p84">Why could this have been? Because the devil is at hand
fierce, desiring to find some secret approach; and though it be but a
little hindrance or delay he takes hold of, he works a great
remissness. Therefore one adviseth, “Put not off from day to
day.”<note n="2581" id="iii.LXV-p84.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p85"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 5.7" id="iii.LXV-p85.1" parsed="|Sir|5|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.5.7">Ecclus. v. 7</scripRef>.</p></note> For thus shalt thou be able to succeed in most things, thus also shall
the things in thine house be well ordered for thee. “For seek
ye,” it is said, “the kingdom of God, and all these things
shall be added unto you.”<note n="2582" id="iii.LXV-p85.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXV-p86"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 33" id="iii.LXV-p86.1" parsed="|Matt|6|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.33">Matt. vi.
33</scripRef>.</p></note> For if we establish in great security them that overlook their own
interests, and prefer the care of ours, much more doth God, who even
without these things hath a care for us, and provides for us.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p87">Be not thoughtful then about thine interests, but leave
them to God. For if thou art thoughtful about them, thou art thoughtful
as a man; but if God provide, He provides as God. Be not so thoughtful
about them as to let go the greater things, since then He will not much
provide for them. In order therefore that He may fully provide for
them, leave them to Him alone. For if thou also thyself takest them in
hand, having let go the things spiritual, He will not make much
provision for them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXV-p88">In order then that both these things may be well
disposed for thee, and that thou mayest be freed from all anxiety,
cleave to the things spiritual, overlook the things of the world; for
in this way thou shalt have earth also with heaven, and shalt attain
unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.LXVI-p7"><span class="c11" id="iii.LXVI-p7.1">Seest</span> thou both in the former
parable and in this the difference between the Son and the servants?
Seest thou at once the great affinity between both parables, and the
great difference also? For this also indicates God’s

<pb n="403" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_403.html" id="iii.LXVI-Page_403" />

long-suffering, and His great providential
care, and the Jews’ ingratitude.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p8">But this parable hath something also more than the
other. For it proclaims beforehand both the casting out of the Jews,
and the calling of the Gentiles; and it indicates together with this
also the strictness of the life required, and how great the punishment
appointed for the careless.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p9">And well is this placed after the other. For since He
had said, “It shall be given to a nation bringing forth the
fruits thereof,” He declares next to what kind of nation; and not
this only, but He also again sets forth His providential care towards
the Jews as past utterance. For there He appears before His crucifixion
bidding them; but here even after He is slain, He still urges them,
striving to win them over. And when they deserved to have suffered the
most grievous punishment, then He both presses them to the marriage,
and honors them with the highest honor. And see how both there He calls
not the Gentiles first, but the Jews, and here again. But as there,
when they would not receive Him, but even slew Him when He was come,
then He gave away the vineyard; thus here too, when they were not
willing to be present at the marriage, then He called others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p10">What then could be more ungrateful than they, when being
bidden to a marriage they rush away? For who would not choose to come
to a marriage, and that a King’s marriage, and of a King making a
marriage for a Son?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p11">And wherefore is it called a marriage? one may say. That
thou mightest learn God’s tender care, His yearning towards us,
the cheerfulness of the state of things, that there is nothing
sorrowful there, nor sad, but all things are full of spiritual joy.
Therefore also John calls Him a bridegroom, therefore Paul again saith,
“For I have espoused you to one husband;”<note n="2586" id="iii.LXVI-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p12"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 2" id="iii.LXVI-p12.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.2">2 Cor. xi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p14">Why then is not the bride said to be espoused to Him,
but to the Son? Because she that is espoused to the Son, is espoused to
the Father. For it is indifferent in Scripture that the one or the
other should be said, because of the identity<note n="2588" id="iii.LXVI-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p15"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXVI-p15.1">ἀπαρλλακτον</span>
.</p></note>of the substance.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p16">Hereby He proclaimed the resurrection also. For since in
what went before He had spoken of the death, He shows that even after
the death, then is the marriage, then the bridegroom.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p17">But not even so do these become better men nor more
gentle, than which what can be worse? For this again is a third
accusation. The first that they killed the prophets; then the son;
afterwards that even when they had slain Him, and were bidden unto the
marriage of Him that was slain, by the very one that was slain, they
come not, but feign excuses, yokes of oxen, and pieces of ground, and
wives. And yet the excuses seem to be reasonable; but hence we learn,
though the things which hinder us be necessary, to set the things
spiritual at a higher price than all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p18">And He not suddenly, but a long time before. For,
“Tell,” He saith, “them that are bidden;” and
again, “Call them that were bidden;” which circumstance
makes the charge against them heavier. And when were they bidden? By
all the prophets; by John again; for unto Christ he would pass all on,
saying, “He must increase, I must decrease;”<note n="2589" id="iii.LXVI-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p19"><scripRef passage="John iii. 30" id="iii.LXVI-p19.1" parsed="|John|3|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.3.30">John iii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p22">But not by words only, but also by actions did He bid
them, after His ascension by Peter, and those with him. “For He
that wrought effectually in Peter,” it is said, “to the
apostleship of the circumcision, was mighty also in me towards the
Gentiles.”<note n="2592" id="iii.LXVI-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p23"><scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 8" id="iii.LXVI-p23.1" parsed="|Gal|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.8">Gal. ii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p24">For since on seeing the Son, they were wroth and slew
Him, He bids them again by His servants. And unto what doth He bid
them? Unto labors, and toils, and sweat? Nay but unto pleasure. For,
“My oxen,” He saith, “and my fatlings are
killed.” See how complete His banquet,<note n="2593" id="iii.LXVI-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p25"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXVI-p25.1">πση
πανδαισα</span>.</p></note>how great His munificence.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p26">And not even this shamed them, but the more
long-suffering He showed, so much the more were they hardened. For not
for press of business, but from “making light of it,” they
did not come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p27">“How then do some bring forward marriages, others
yokes of oxen? these things surely are of want of leisure.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p28">By no means, for when spiritual things call us, there is
no press of business that has the power of necessity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p29">And to me they seem moreover to make use of these
excuses, putting forward these things as cloke for their negligence.
And not this only is the grievous thing, that they came not, but also
that which is a far more violent

<pb n="404" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_404.html" id="iii.LXVI-Page_404" />

and furious act, to have even beaten them that came, and to
have used them despitefully, and to have slain them; this is worse than
the former. For those others came, demanding produce and fruits, and
were slain; but these, bidding them to the marriage of Him that had
been slain by them, and these again are murdered.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p30">What is equal to this madness? This Paul also was laying
to their charge, when he said, “Who both killed the Lord, and
their own prophets, and have persecuted us.”<note n="2594" id="iii.LXVI-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p31"><scripRef passage="1 Thess. ii. 15" id="iii.LXVI-p31.1" parsed="|1Thess|2|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.2.15">1 Thess.

adversary of God, and therefore we do not come,” hear what they
say who are bidding them; that it is the father who is making the
marriage, and that it is He who is bidding them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p33">What then did He after these things? Since they were not
willing to come, yea and also slew those that came unto them; He burns
up their cities, and sent His armies and slew them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p34">And these things He saith, declaring beforehand the
things that took place under Vespasian and Titus, and that they
provoked the father also, by not believing in Him; it is the father at
any rate who was avenging.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p35">And for this reason let me add, not straightway after
Christ was slain did the capture take place, but after forty years,
that He might show His long suffering, when they had slain Stephen,
when they had put James to death, when they had spitefully entreated
the apostles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p36">Seest thou the truth of the event, and its quickness?
For while John was yet living, and many other of them that were with
Christ, these things came to pass, and they that had heard these words
were witnesses of the events.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p37">See then care utterable. He had planted a vineyard; He
had done all things, and finished; when His servants had been put to
death, He sent other servants; when those had been slain, He sent the
son; and when He was put to death, He bids them to the marriage. They
would not come. After this He sends other servants, and they slew these
also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p38">Then upon this He slays them, as being incurably
diseased. For that they were incurably diseased, was proved not by
their acts only, but by the fact, that even when harlots and publicans
had believed, they did these things. So that, not by their own crimes
alone, but also from what others were able to do aright, these men are
condemned,</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p39">But if any one should say, that not then were they out
of the Gentiles called, I mean, when the apostles had been beaten and
had suffered ten thousand things, but straightway after the
resurrection (for then He said to them, “Go ye and make disciples
of all nations.”<note n="2595" id="iii.LXVI-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxviii. 19" id="iii.LXVI-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|28|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.28.19">Matt.
xxviii. 19</scripRef>.</p></note>) We would say, that both before the crucifixion, and after the
crucifixion, they addressed themselves to them first. For both before
the crucifixion, He saith to them, “Go to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel;”<note n="2596" id="iii.LXVI-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p41"><scripRef passage="Matt. x. 6" id="iii.LXVI-p41.1" parsed="|Matt|10|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.6">Matt. x.
6</scripRef>.</p></note>and after the crucifixion, so far from forbidding, He even commanded
them to address themselves to the Jews. For though He said, “Make
disciples of all nations,” yet when on the point of ascending
into Heaven, He declared that unto those first they were to address
themselves; For, “ye shall receive power,” saith He,
“after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judæa, and unto
the uttermost part of the earth;”<note n="2597" id="iii.LXVI-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p42"><scripRef passage="Acts i. 8" id="iii.LXVI-p42.1" parsed="|Acts|1|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.1.8">Acts i.
8</scripRef>.</p></note>and Paul again, “He that wrought effectually in Peter to the
apostleship of the circumcision, was mighty in me also toward the
Gentiles.”<note n="2598" id="iii.LXVI-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p43"><scripRef passage="Gal. ii. 8" id="iii.LXVI-p43.1" parsed="|Gal|2|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.8">Gal. ii.
8</scripRef>. [Comp. note 7, p.
421.]</p></note> Therefore the apostles also went first unto the Jews, and when they had
tarried a long time in Jerusalem, and then had been driven away by
them, in this way they were scattered abroad unto the Gentiles.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p44">2. And see thou even herein His bounty; “As many
as ye shall find,” saith He, “bid to the marriage.”
For before this, as I said, they addressed themselves both to Jews and
Greeks, tarrying for the most part in Judæa; but since they
continued to lay plots against them, hear Paul interpreting this
parable, and saying thus, “It was necessary that the word of God
should first have been spoken to you, but since ye judge yourselves
unworthy, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.”<note n="2599" id="iii.LXVI-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p45"><scripRef passage="Acts xiii. 46" id="iii.LXVI-p45.1" parsed="|Acts|13|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.13.46">Acts xiii.
46</scripRef>. [Slightly abridged.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p46">Therefore Christ also saith, “The wedding is
ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p47">He knew this indeed even before, but that He might leave
them no pretext of a shameless sort of contradiction, although He knew
it, to them first He both came and sent, both stopping their mouths,
and teaching us to fulfill all our parts, though no one should derive
any profit.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p48">Since then they were not worthy, go ye, saith He, into
the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid; both the common sort,
and the outcasts. For because He had said in every way,<note n="2600" id="iii.LXVI-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p49">Or, “repeatedly.”</p></note>“The harlots and publicans shall inherit heaven;” and,
“The first shall

<pb n="405" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_405.html" id="iii.LXVI-Page_405" />

be last,
and the last first;” He shows that justly do these things come to
pass; which more than anything stung the Jews, and goaded them far more
grievously than their overthrow, to see those from the Gentiles brought
into their privileges, and into far greater than theirs.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p50">Then in order that not even these should put confidence
in their faith alone, He discourses unto them also concerning the
judgment to be passed upon wicked actions; to them that have not yet
believed, of coming unto Him by faith, and to them that have believed,
of care with respect to their life. For the garment is life and
practice.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p51">And yet the calling was of grace; wherefore then doth He
take a strict account? Because although to be called and to be cleansed
was of grace, yet, when called and clothed in clean garments, to
continue keeping them so, this is of the diligence of them that are
called.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p52">The being called was not of merit, but of grace. It was
fit therefore to make a return for the grace, and not to show forth
such great wickedness after the honor. “But I have not
enjoyed,” one may say, “so much advantage as the
Jews.” Nay, but thou hast enjoyed far greater benefits. For what
things were being prepared for them throughout all their time, these
thou hast received at once, not being worthy. Wherefore Paul also
saith, “And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His
mercy.”<note n="2601" id="iii.LXVI-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p53"><scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 9" id="iii.LXVI-p53.1" parsed="|Rom|15|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.9">Rom. xv.
9</scripRef>.</p></note> For what things were due to them, these thou hast received.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p54">Wherefore also great is the punishment appointed for
them that have been remiss. For as they did despite by not coming, so
also thou by thus sitting down with a corrupt life. For to come in with
filthy garments is this namely, to depart hence having one’s life
impure; wherefore also he was speechless.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p55">Seest thou how, although the fact was so manifest, He
doth not punish at once, until he himself, who has sinned, has passed
the sentence? For by having nothing to reply he condemned himself, and
so is taken away to the unutterable torments.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p56">For do not now, on hearing of darkness, suppose he is
punished by this, by sending into a place where there is no light only,
but where “there is” also “weeping and gnashing of
teeth.”<note n="2602" id="iii.LXVI-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p57"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 13" id="iii.LXVI-p57.1" parsed="|Matt|22|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.13">Matt. xxii.
13</scripRef>.</p></note> And this He saith, indicating the intolerable pains.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p58">Hear ye, as many as having partaken of the mysteries,
and having been present at the marriage, clothe your souls with filthy
deeds. Hear whence ye were called.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p59">From the highway. Being what? Lame and halt in soul,
which is a much more grievous thing than the mutilation of the body.
Reverence the love of Him, who called you, and let no one continue to
have filthy garments, but let each of you busy himself about the
clothing of your soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p60">Hear, ye women; hear, ye men; we need not these garments
that are bespangled with gold, <i>that adorn our outward
parts</i>,<note n="2603" id="iii.LXVI-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p61">[The clause in italics is not found in the <span class="c20" id="iii.LXVI-p61.1">mss</span>. collated by Field, but occurs in the
Benedictine edition.—R.]</p></note>but those others, that adorn the inward. Whilst we have these former,
it is difficult to put on those latter. It is not possible at the same
time to deck both soul and body. It is not possible at the same time
both to serve mammon, and to obey Christ as we ought.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p62">Let us put off us therefore this grievous tyranny. For
neither if any one were to adorn thy house by hanging it with golden
curtains, and were to make thee sit there in rags, naked, wouldest thou
endure it with meekness. But lo, now thou doest this to thyself,
decking the house of thy soul, I mean the body, with curtains beyond
number, but leaving the soul itself to sit in rags. Knowest thou not
that the king ought to be adorned more than the city? so therefore
while for the city hangings are prepared of linen, for the king there
is a purple robe and a diadem. Even so do thou wrap the body with a
much meaner dress, but the mind do thou clothe in purple, and put a
crown on it, and set it on a high and conspicuous chariot. For now thou
art doing the opposite, decking the city in various ways, but suffering
the king, the mind, to be dragged bound after the brute passions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p63">Rememberest thou not, that thou art bidden to a
marriage, and to God’s marriage? Considerest thou not how the
soul that is bidden ought to enter into those chambers, clad, and
decked with fringes of gold.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p64">3. Wilt thou that I show thee them that are clad thus,
them that have on a marriage garment?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p65">Call to mind those holy persons, of whom I discoursed to
you of late, them that wear garments of hair, them that dwell in the
deserts. These above all are the wearers of the garments of that
wedding; this is evident from hence, that how many soever purple robes
thou wert to give them, they would not choose to receive them; but much
as a king, if any one were to take the beggar’s rags, and exhort
him to put them on, would abhor the clothing, so would those persons
also his purple robe. And from no other cause have they this feeling,
but because of knowing the beauty of their own raiment. Therefore even

<pb n="406" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_406.html" id="iii.LXVI-Page_406" />

that purple robe they spurn like
the spider’s web. For these things hath their sackcloth taught
them; for indeed they are far more exalted and more glorious than the
very king who reigns.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p66">And if thou wert able to open the doors of the mind, and
to look upon their soul, and all their ornaments within, surely thou
wouldest fall down upon the earth, not bearing the glory of their
beauty, and the splendor of those garments, and the lightning
brightness of their conscience.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p67">For we could tell also of men of old, great and to be
admired; but since visible examples lead on more those of grosser
souls, therefore do I send you even to the tabernacles of those holy
persons. For they have nothing sorrowful, but as if in heaven they had
pitched their tents, even so are they encamped far off the wearisome
things of this present life, in campaign against the devils; and as in
choirs, so do they war against him. Therefore I say, they have fixed
their tents, and have fled from cities, and markets, and houses. For he
that warreth cannot sit in a house, but he must make his habitation of
a temporary kind, as on the point of removing straightway, and so
dwell. Such are all those persons, contrary to us. For we indeed live
not as in a camp, but as in a city at peace.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p68">For who in a camp ever lays foundation, and builds
himself a house, which he is soon after to leave? There is not one; but
should any one attempt it, he is put to death as a traitor. Who in a
camp buys acres of land, and makes for himself trades? There is not
one, and very reasonably. “For thou art come here,” they
would say, “to fight, not to traffic; why then dost thou trouble
thyself about the place, which in a little time thou wilt leave? When
we are gone away to our country, do these things.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p69">The same do I now say to thee also. When we have removed
to the city that is above, do these things: or rather thou wilt have no
need of labors there; after that the king will do all things for thee.
But here it is enough to dig a ditch round only, and to fix a palisade,
but of building houses there is no need.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p70">Hear what was the life of the Scythians, that lived in
their wagons, such, as they say, are the habits of the shepherd tribes.
So ought Christians to live; to go about the world, warring against the
devil, rescuing the captives held in subjection by him, and to be in
freedom from all worldly things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p71">Why preparest thou a house, O man, that thou mayest bind
thyself more? Why dost thou bury a treasure, and invite the enemy
against thyself? Why dost thou compass thyself with walls, and prepare
a prison for thyself?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p72">But if these things seem to thee to be hard, let us go
away unto the tents of those men, that by their deeds we may learn the
easiness thereof. For they having set up huts, if they must depart from
these, depart like as soldiers, having left their camp in peace. For so
likewise are they encamped, or rather even much more beautifully.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p73">For indeed it is more pleasant to behold a desert
containing huts of monks in close succession, than soldiers stretching
the canvas in a camp, and fixing spears, and suspending from the point
of the spears saffron garments,<note n="2604" id="iii.LXVI-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p74"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXVI-p74.1">φρη
κροκωτ</span>.</p></note>and a multitude of men having heads of brass, and the bosses of the
shields glistening much, and men armed all throughout with steel, and
royal courts hastily made, and ground levelled far, and men dining and
piping. For neither is this spectacle so delightful as that of which I
now speak.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p75">For if we were to go away into the wilderness, and look
at the tents of Christ’s soldiers, we shall see not canvas
stretched, neither points of spears, nor golden garments making a royal
pavilion; but like as if any one upon an earth much larger than this
earth, yea infinite, had stretched out many heavens, strange and awful
would be the sight he showed; even so may one see here.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p76">For in nothing are their lodging-places in a condition
inferior to the heavens; for the angels lodge with them, and the Lord
of the angels. For if they came to Abraham, a man having a wife, and
bringing up children, because they saw him hospitable; when they find
much more abundant virtue, and a man delivered from the body, and in
the flesh disregarding the flesh, much more do they tarry there, and
celebrate the choral feast that becomes them. For there is moreover a
table amongst them pure from all covetousness, and full of
self-denial.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p77">No streams of blood are amongst them, nor cutting up of
flesh, nor heaviness of head, nor dainty cooking, neither are there
unpleasing smells of meat amongst them, nor disagreeable smoke, neither
runnings and tumults, and disturbances, and wearisome clamors; but
bread and water, the latter from a pure fountain, the former from
honest labor. But if any time they should be minded to feast more
sumptuously, their sumptuousness consists of fruits, and greater is the
pleasure there than at royal tables. There is no fear there, or
trembling; no ruler accuses, no wife provokes, no child casts into
sadness, no dis

<pb n="407" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_407.html" id="iii.LXVI-Page_407" />

orderly mirth
dissipates, no multitude of flatterers puffs up; but the table is an
angel’s table free from all such turmoil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p78">And for a couch they have grass only beneath them, like
as Christ did when making a dinner in the wilderness. And many of them
do this, not being even under shelter, but for a roof they have heaven,
and the moon instead of the light of a candle, not wanting oil, nor one
to attend to it; on them alone does it shine worthily from on high.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p79">4. This table even angels from heaven beholding are
delighted and pleased. For if over one sinner that repenteth they
rejoice, over so many just men imitating them, what will they not do?
There are not master and slave; all are slaves, all free men. And do
not think the saying to be a dark proverb, for they are indeed slaves
one of another, and masters one of another.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p80">They have no occasion to be in sadness when evening has
overtaken them, as many men feel, revolving the anxious thoughts that
spring from the evils of the day. They have no occasion after their
supper to be careful about robbers, and to shut the doors, and to put
bars against them, neither to dread the other ills, of which many are
afraid, extinguishing their candles with strict care, lest a spark
anywhere should set the house on fire.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p81">And their conversation again is full of the same calm.
For they talk not of these things, whereof we discourse, that are
nothing to us; such a one is made governor, such a one has ceased to be
governor; such a one is dead, and another has succeeded to the
inheritance, and all such like, but always about the things to come do
they speak and seek wisdom; and as though dwelling in another world, as
though they had migrated unto heaven itself, as living there, even so
all their conversation is about the things there, about Abraham’s
bosom, about the crowns of the saints, about the choiring with Christ;
and of things present they have neither any memory nor thought, but
like as we should not deign to speak at all of what the ants do in
their holes and clefts; so neither do they of what we do; but about the
King that is above, about the war in which they are engaged, about the
devil’s crafts, about the good deeds which the saints have
achieved.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p82">Wherein therefore are we different from ants, when
compared with them? For like as they care for the things of the body,
so also do we; and would it were for these alone: but now it is even
for things far worse. For not for necessary things only do we care like
them, but also for things superfluous. For those insects pursue a
business free from all blame, but we follow after all covetousness, and
not even the ways of ants do we imitate, but the ways of wolves, but
the ways of leopards, or rather we are even worse than these. For to
them nature has assigned that they should be thus fed, but us God hath
honored with speech, and a sense of equity,<note n="2605" id="iii.LXVI-p82.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p83"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXVI-p83.1">ἰσονομ</span>.</p></note>and we are become worse than the wild beasts.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p84">And whereas we are worse than the brutes, those men are
equal to the angels, being strangers and pilgrims as to the things
here; and all things in them are made different from us, clothing, and
food, and house, and shoes, and speech. And if any one were to hear
them conversing and us, then he would know full well, how they indeed
are citizens of heaven, but we are not worthy so much as of the
earth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p85">So that therefore, when any one invested with rank is
come unto them, then is all inflated pride found utterly vain. For the
laborer there, and he that hath no experience of worldly affairs, sits
near him that is a commander of troops, and prides himself on his
authority, upon the grass, upon a mean cushion. For there are none to
extol him, none to puff him up; but the same result takes place, as if
any one were to go to a goldsmith, and a garden of roses, for he
receives some brightness from the gold and from the roses; so they too,
gaining a little from the splendor of these, are delivered from their
former arrogance. And like as if any were to go upon a high place,
though he be exceedingly short, he appears high; so these too, coming
unto their exalted minds, appear like them, so long as they abide
there, but when they are gone down are abased again, on descending from
that height.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p86">A king is nothing amongst them, a governor is nothing;
but like as we, when children are playing at these things, laugh; so do
they also utterly spurn the inflamed pride of them who strut without.
And this is evident from hence, that if any one would give them a
kingdom to possess in security, they would never take it; yet they
would take it, unless their thoughts were upon what is greater than it,
unless they accounted the thing to be but for a season.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p87">What then? Shall we not go over unto blessedness so
great? Shall we not come unto these angels; shall we not receive clean
garments, and join in the ceremonies of this wedding feast; but shall
we continue begging, in no respect in a better condition than the poor
in the streets, or rather in a state far worse and more wretched? For
much worse

<pb n="408" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_408.html" id="iii.LXVI-Page_408" />

than these are they
that are rich in evil ways, and it is better to beg than to spoil, for
the one hath excuse, but the other brings punishment; and the beggar in
no degree offends God, but this other both men and God; and undergoes
the labors of rapine, but all the enjoyment thereof other men often
reap.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVI-p88">Knowing then these things, let us lay aside all
covetousness, and covet the things above, with great earnestness
“taking the kingdom by force.”<note n="2606" id="iii.LXVI-p88.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVI-p89"><scripRef passage="Matt. xi. 12" id="iii.LXVI-p89.1" parsed="|Matt|11|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.12">Matt. xi.

they ought to have been moved to compunction, when they should have

prepared for a revolt, they were minded to bring Him too by these words
into such a suspicion. Therefore they sent both their own disciples,
and Herod’s soldiers, digging, as they thought, a precipice on
either side, and in every direction setting the snare, so that,
whatever He should say, they might lay hold of it; and if He should
answer in favor of the Herodians, themselves might find fault with Him,
but if in their favor, the others should accuse Him. And yet He had
given the didrachmas,<note n="2609" id="iii.LXVII-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. xvii. 24, 25-27" id="iii.LXVII-p10.1">Matt. xvii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p11">And in either way indeed they expected to lay hold of
Him; but they desired rather that He should say something against the
Herodians. Wherefore they send their disciples also to urge Him thereto
by their presence, that they might deliver Him to the governor as an
usurper. For this Luke also intimates and shows, by saying, that they
asked also in the presence of the multitude, so that the testimony
should be the stronger.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p12">But the result was altogether opposite; for in a larger
body of spectators they afforded the demonstration of their folly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p13">And see their flattery, and their hidden craft.
“We know,” their words are, “that Thou art
true.” How said ye then, “He is a deceiver,” and
“deceiveth the people,” and “hath a devil,” and
“is not of God?”<note n="2610" id="iii.LXVII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p14"><scripRef passage="John vii. 12; viii. 48; ix. 16" id="iii.LXVII-p14.1" parsed="|John|7|12|0|0;|John|8|48|0|0;|John|9|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.7.12 Bible:John.8.48 Bible:John.9.16">John vii.

when a little before they had said in self

up by their flattery, and to persuade Him to say something against the
established laws, and opposed to the prevailing government.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p17">Wherefore also they testify the truth unto Him,
confessing what was really so, nevertheless, not with an upright mind,
nor willingly; and add thereto, saying, “Thou carest not for any
man.” See how plainly they are desiring to urge Him to these
sayings, that would make Him both offend Herod, and incur the suspicion
of being an usurper, as standing up against the laws, so that they
might punish Him, as a mover of sedition, and an usurper. For in
saying, “Thou carest not for any man,” and, “Thou
regardest not the person of man,” they were hinting at Herod and
Cæsar.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p18">“Tell us therefore, what thinkest Thou?” Now
ye honor Him, and esteem Him a Teacher, having despised and insulted
Him oftentimes, when He was discoursing of the things that concern your
salvation. Whence also they are become confederates.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p19">And see their craftiness. They say not, Tell us what is
good, what is expedient, what is lawful? but, “What thinkest
Thou?” So much did they look to this one object, to betray Him,
and to set Him at enmity with the rulers. And Mark declaring this, and
more plainly discovering their self-will, and their murderous
disposition, affirms them to have said, “Shall we give Cæsar
tribute, or shall we not give?”<note n="2612" id="iii.LXVII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p20"><scripRef passage="Mark xii. 15" id="iii.LXVII-p20.1" parsed="|Mark|12|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.12.15">Mark xii.
15</scripRef>.</p></note> So that they were breathing anger, and travailing with a plot against
Him, yet they feigned respect.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p21">What then saith He? “Why tempt ye me, ye
hypocrites?” Seest thou how He talks with them with more than
usual severity? For since their wickedness was now complete and
manifest, He cuts the deeper, first confounding and silencing them, by
publishing their secret thoughts, and making it manifest to all with
what kind of intent they are coming unto Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p22">And these things He did, repulsing their wickedness, so
that they might not suffer hurt in attempting the same things again.
And yet their words were full of much respect, for they both called Him
Master, and bore witness to His truth, and that He was no respecter of
persons; but being God, He was deceived by none of these things.
Wherefore they also ought to have conjectured, that the rebuke was not
the result of conjecture, but a sign of His knowing their secret
thoughts.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p23">2. He stopped not, however, at the rebuke, although it
was enough merely to have convicted them of their purpose, and to have
put them to shame for their wickedness; but He stoppeth not at this,
but in another way closes their mouths; for, “Shew me,”
saith He, “the tribute money.” And when they had shown it,
as He ever doth, by their tongue He brings out the decision, and causes
them to decide, that it is lawful; which was a clear and plain victory.
So that, when He asks, not from ignorance doth He ask, but because it
is His will to cause them to be bound by their own answers. For when,
on being asked, “Whose is the image?” they said,
“Cæsar’s;” He saith, “Render unto
Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s.”<note n="2613" id="iii.LXVII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 20, 21" id="iii.LXVII-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|22|20|22|21" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.20-Matt.22.21">Matt. xxii.
20, 21</scripRef>. [Abridged.]</p></note> For this is not to give but to render, and this He shows both by the
image, and by the superscription.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p25">Then that they might not say, Thou art subjecting us to
men, He added, “And unto God the things that are
God’s.” For it is possible both to fulfill to men their
claims and to give unto God the things that are due to God from us.
Wherefore Paul also saith, “Render unto all their dues; tribute
to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom
fear.”<note n="2614" id="iii.LXVII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p26"><scripRef passage="Rom. xiii. 7" id="iii.LXVII-p26.1" parsed="|Rom|13|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.13.7">Rom. xiii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p27">But thou, when thou hearest, “Render unto
Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s,” know that He
is speaking only of those things, which are no detriment to godliness;
since if it be any such thing as this, such a thing is no longer
Cæsar’s tribute, but the devil’s.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p28">When they heard these things, their mouths were stopped,
and they “marvelled” at His wisdom. Ought they not then to
have believed, ought they not to have been amazed. For indeed, He gave
them proof of His Godhead, by revealing the secrets of their hearts,
and with gentleness did He silence them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p29">What then? did they believe? By no means, but they
“left Him, and went their way;” and after them, “came
to Him the Sadducees.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p30">O folly! When the others had been put to silence, these
made the attack, when they ought to have been the more backward. But
such is the nature of rashness, shameless, and importunate, and
attempting things impossible. Therefore the evangelist also, amazed at
their folly, signified this very thing, by saying, “On that day
came to Him.”<note n="2615" id="iii.LXVII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 22, 23" id="iii.LXVII-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|22|22|22|23" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.22-Matt.22.23">Matt. xxii.

the body. For there were many sects even amongst the Jews. Wherefore
Paul also saith, “I am a Pharisee, of the strictest sect amongst
us.”<note n="2617" id="iii.LXVII-p32.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p33"><scripRef passage="Acts 23.6; 26.5" id="iii.LXVII-p33.1" parsed="|Acts|23|6|0|0;|Acts|26|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.23.6 Bible:Acts.26.5">Acts xxiii. 6, and xxvi. 5</scripRef>.</p></note>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p34">And they say nothing indeed directly about a
resurrection; but they feign a story, and make up a case, which, as I
suppose, never so much as had an existence; thinking to drive Him to
perplexity, and desiring to overthrow both things, both the existence
of a resurrection, and of such a resurrection.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p35">And again, these too attack Him with a show of
moderation, saying, “Master, Moses said, If a man die, not having
children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
brother. Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
had married a wife, deceased; and, having no issue,<note n="2618" id="iii.LXVII-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p36">[R.V., “seed.”]</p></note>left his wife unto his brother. Likewise the second also, and the
third, unto the seventh. And last of all the woman died also.
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the
seven?”<note n="2619" id="iii.LXVII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 24-28" id="iii.LXVII-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|22|24|22|28" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.24-Matt.22.28">Matt. xxii.
24–28</scripRef>. [With the
trifling variations the Greek of these verses agrees with the received
text.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p38">See Him answering these like a teacher. For though out
of craft they came unto Him, yet was their question rather one of
ignorance. Therefore neither doth He say unto them, “Ye
hypocrites.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p39">Moreover, in order that He might not blame, saying,
“Wherefore had seven one wife?” they add the authority of
Moses; although, as I have said before, it was a fiction, in my
judgment at least. For the third would not have taken her, when he saw
the two bridegrooms dead; or if the third, yet not the fourth or the
fifth; and if even these, much more the sixth or the seventh would not
have come unto the woman, but have shrunk from her. For such is the
nature of the Jews. For if now many have this feeling, much more then
had they; when at least, even without this, they often avoided marrying
in this way, and that when the law was constraining them. Thus, at any
rate, Ruth, that Moabitish woman, was thrust off to him that was
further off from her kindred; and Tamar too was thus compelled to
obtain, by stealth, seed from her husband’s kinsman.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p40">And wherefore did they not feign two or three, but
seven? In order the more abundantly to bring derision, as they thought,
upon the resurrection. Wherefore they further say, “they all had
her,” as driving Him into some difficulty.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p41">What then saith Christ? He replies unto both, as taking
His stand not against the words, but the purpose, and on every occasion
revealing the secrets of their hearts; and at one time exposing them,
at another time leaving the refutation of them that question Him to
their conscience. See, at any rate here, how He proves both points, as
well that there will be a resurrection, as that it will not be such a
resurrection as they suspect.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p42">For what saith He? “Ye do err, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God.”<note n="2620" id="iii.LXVII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 29" id="iii.LXVII-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|22|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.29">Matt. xxii.
29</scripRef>.</p></note> For since, as if they knew them, they put forward Moses and the law, He
shows that this question is that of men very ignorant of the
Scriptures. For hence also arose their tempting Him, from their being
ignorant of the Scriptures, and from their not knowing the power of God
as they ought.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p44">“For what marvel then is it,” He saith,
“if ye tempt me, who am as yet unknown to you, when at least ye
know not so much as the power of God, of which ye have had so much
experience, and neither from common sense nor from the Scriptures have
become acquainted with it;” if indeed even common sense causes us
to know this, that to God all things are possible. And in the first
place He answers to the question asked. For since this was the cause
for their not believing a resurrection, that they think the order of
things is like this, He cures the cause, then the symptom also (for
thence arose the disease too), and shows the manner of the
resurrection. “For in the resurrection,” saith He,
“they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels
of God in Heaven.”<note n="2621" id="iii.LXVII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 30" id="iii.LXVII-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|22|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.30">Matt. xxii.

peculiar, but conveys the same sense as the received

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p47">If then they marry not, the question is vain. But not
because they do not marry, therefore are they angels, but because they
are as angels, therefore they do not marry. By this He removed many
other difficulties also, all which things Paul intimated by one word,
saying, “For the fashion of this world passeth away.”<note n="2623" id="iii.LXVII-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p48"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 31" id="iii.LXVII-p48.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.31">1 Cor. vii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p49">And by these words He declared how great a thing the
resurrection is; and that moreover there is a resurrection, He proves.
And indeed this too was demonstrated at the same time by what He had
said, nevertheless over and above He adds again to His word by what He
saith now. For neither at their question only did He stop, but at their

<pb n="411" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_411.html" id="iii.LXVII-Page_411" />

thought. Thus when they are not
dealing with great craft, but are asking in ignorance, He teaches even
over and above, but when it is of wickedness only, not even to their
question doth He answer.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p50">And again by Moses doth He stop their mouths, since they
too had brought forward Moses; and He saith, “But as touching the
resurrection of the dead, have ye not read, I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the
dead, but of the living.”<note n="2624" id="iii.LXVII-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 31, 32" id="iii.LXVII-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|22|31|22|32" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.31-Matt.22.32">Matt. xxii.

R.V. follows a slightly different reading: “God is not the
God,” etc.—R.]</p></note> Not of them that are not His meaning is, and that are utterly blotted
out, and are to rise no more. For He said not, I was, but, I am; of
them that are, and them that live. For like as Adam, although he lived
on the day that he ate of the tree, died in the sentence: even so also
these, although they had died, lived in the promise of the
resurrection.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p52">How then doth He say elsewhere, “That He might be
Lord both of the dead and of the living?”<note n="2625" id="iii.LXVII-p52.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p53"><scripRef passage="Rom. xiv. 9" id="iii.LXVII-p53.1" parsed="|Rom|14|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.9">Rom. xiv.

are also themselves to live. And moreover too, “I am the God of
Abraham,” is another thing from, “That He might be Lord
both of the dead and of the living.” He knew of another death
too, concerning which He saith, “Let the dead bury their
dead.”<note n="2626" id="iii.LXVII-p53.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p54"><scripRef passage="Matt. viii. 22" id="iii.LXVII-p54.1" parsed="|Matt|8|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.8.22">Matt. viii.

all things, that we may obtain the first honors there. But, if ye will,
let us show you some even before the resurrection here pursuing and
reaping these blessings, again having made our resort to the deserts.
For again will I enter upon the same discourse, since I see you
listening with more pleasure.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p58">Let us behold then to-day also the spiritual camps, let

gluttony. And their table proves it, and the trophy that is set
thereon. For drunkenness and gluttony lie dead, put to the rout by the
drinking of water, though this be multiform, and a many-headed monster.
For like as in the fabled Scylla and Hydra, so in drunkenness may one
see many heads, on one side fornication growing up, on another wrath;
on one hand sloth, on another lawless lusts; but all these things are
taken away. And yet all those other armies, though they get the better
in ten thousand wars, are taken captive by these; and neither arms, nor
spears, nor whatever else there may be, is able to stand against these
phalanxes; but the very giants, the heroes, those that do countless
brave deeds, thou wilt find without bonds bound by sleep and
drunkenness, without slaughter or wounds lying like the wounded, or
rather in more grievous case. For those at least struggle; but these do
not even this, but straightway give up.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p62">Seest thou that this host is greater and more to be
admired? For the enemies that got the better of the others it destroys
by its mere will. For they do so weaken the mother of all their evils,
that she cannot even trouble them any more; and the leader being
overthrown, and the head removed, the rest of the body also lies
still.</p>

there, achieving. For it is not as in these wars of ours, where, if any

monster; and he that hath not smitten and overthrown her, is surely
troubled by her.</p>

hosts in all parts of the world having met together have not power to

the lusts that arise from luxurious living, those that are cherished by
the makers of sauces, by the cooks, the furnishers of feasts, the
confectioners. For I am ashamed indeed to speak of all; however, I will
tell of the birds from Phasis, the soups that are mixed from various
things: the moist, the dry dishes, the laws made about these things.
For like as if ordering some city and marshalling hosts, even so these
too make laws, and ordain such a thing first, and such a thing second,
and some bring in first birds roasted on the embers, filled within with
fish; and others make of other material the beginnings of these
unlawful feasts; and there is much rivalry about these things, about
quality, and about order, and about quantity; and they take a pride in
the things, for which they ought to bury themselves for shame; some
saying that they have spent the half of the day, some all of it, some
that they have added the night too. Behold, O wretched man, the measure
of thy belly, and be ashamed of thy unmeasured earnestness!</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p67">But there is nothing like this amongst those angels; but
all these desires also are dead. For their meals are not unto fullness,

the house and from the body, and great is the haven, but amongst these
great the tempest.</p>

such things, and thou wilt see the vast refuse, and the unclean
channel, and the whited sepulchre.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p69">But what come after these I am even ashamed to tell, the
disagreeable eructations, the vomitings, the discharges downwards and
upwards.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p70">But go and see even these desires dead there, and those
more violent lusts that spring from these; I mean, those of impurity.
For these too thou wilt see all overthrown, with their horses, with
their beasts of burden. For the beast of burden, and the weapon, and
the horse of a filthy deed, is a filthy word. But thou wilt see such
like horse and rider together, and their weapons thrown down; but here
quite the contrary, and souls cast down dead. But not at their meal
only is the victory of these holy men glorious, but in the other things
also, in money, in glory, in envy, in all diseases of the soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p71">Surely does not this host seem to thee mightier than
that, and the meal better? Nay, who will gainsay it? None, not even of
those persons themselves, though he be very mad. For this guides us on
to Heaven, that drags to hell; this the devil lays out, that Christ;
for this luxury gives laws, and intemperance, for that self-denial and
sobriety, here Christ is present, there the devil. For where there is
drunkenness, the devil is there; where there are filthy words, where
there is surfeiting, there the devils hold their choirs. Such a table
had that rich man, therefore not even of a drop of water was he
master.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p72">But these have not such a table, but they already
practise the ways of the angels. They marry not, they are not given in
marriage, neither do they sleep excessively, nor live luxuriously, but
except a few things they are even bodiless.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p73">Now who is there that so easily overcomes his enemies as
he that sets up a trophy while at his dinner? Therefore also the
prophet saith, “Thou hast prepared a table before me, in the
presence of them that trouble me.”<note n="2630" id="iii.LXVII-p73.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVII-p74"><scripRef passage="Ps. xxiii. 5" id="iii.LXVII-p74.1" parsed="|Ps|23|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.23.5">Ps. xxiii.
5</scripRef>. [<span class="c20" id="iii.LXVII-p74.2">LXX</span>.]</p></note> One could not be wrong in repeating this oracle about this table. For
nothing so troubles a soul as disorderly concupiscence, and luxury, and
drunkenness, and the evils that spring from these; and this they know
full well who have had experience thereof.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p75">And if thou wast to learn also, whence this table is
procured, and whence that; then thou wouldest see well the difference
between each. Whence then is this procured. From countless tears, from
widows defrauded, from orphans despoiled; but the other from honest
labor. And this table is like to a fair and well-favored woman, needing
nothing external, but having her beauty from nature; but that to some
ugly and ill-favored harlot, wearing much paint, but not able to
disguise her deformity, but the nearer she is, the more convicted. For
this too, when it is nearer to him that is at it, then shows its
ugliness more. For look not I tell thee, at the banqueters, as they
come only, but also as they go away, and then thou wilt see its
ugliness. For that, as being free, suffers them that come unto it to
say nothing shameful; but this nothing seemly, as being a harlot, and
dishonored. This seeks the profit of him that is at it, that the hurt.
And one permits not to offend God, the other permits not but that we
must offend Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p76">Let us go away therefore unto those men. Thence we shall
learn with how many bonds we are encompassed. Thence shall we learn to
set before ourselves a table full of countless blessings, most sweet,
without cost, delivered from care, free from envy and jeal

<pb n="413" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_413.html" id="iii.LXVII-Page_413" />

ousy and every disease, and full of good hope,
and having its many trophies. No turmoil of soul there, no sorrow, no
wrath; all is calm, all is peace.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p77">For tell me not of the silence of them that serve in the
houses of the rich, but of the clamor of them that dine; I mean, not
that which they make one to another (for this too is worthy of
derision), but that within, that in the soul, that brings on them a
great captivity, the tumults of the thoughts, the sleet, the darkness,
the tempest, by which all things are mingled and confused, and are like
to some night battle. But not in the monks’ tents are such things
as these; but great is the calm, great the quietness. And that table is
succeeded by a sleep that is like death, but this by sobriety and
wakefulness; that by punishment, this by the kingdom of heaven, and the
immortal rewards.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVII-p78">This then let us follow, that we may enjoy also the
fruits thereof; unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ to whom be glory and
might world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.LXVIII-p3">“But when the Pharisees had heard that He had put
the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together; and one of them,

Master, which is the great commandment in the law?”</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.LXVIII-p4"><span class="c11" id="iii.LXVIII-p4.1">Again</span> doth the evangelist
express the cause, for which they ought to have held their peace, and
marks their boldness by this also. How and in what way? Because when
those others were put to silence, these again assail Him. For when they
ought even for this to hold their peace, they strive to urge further
their former endeavors,<note n="2631" id="iii.LXVIII-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p5"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXVIII-p5.1">ἐπαγωνζονται

of Him, and ask, “What is the first commandment?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p6">For since the first commandment was this, “Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God,” thinking that He would afford them
some handle, as though He would amend it, for the sake of showing that
Himself too was God, they propose the question. What then saith Christ?
Indicating from what they were led to this; from having no charity,
from pining with envy, from being seized by jealousy, He saith,
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God. This is the first and great
commandment.<note n="2632" id="iii.LXVIII-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p7">[R.V., following a different reading, “great

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p15">But His commandments, and the sum of them, are,
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and thy neighbor as
thyself.” If therefore to love God is to love one’s
neighbor, “For if thou lovest me,” He saith, “O
Peter, feed my sheep,”<note n="2639" id="iii.LXVIII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p16"><scripRef passage="John xxi. 16, 17" id="iii.LXVIII-p16.1" parsed="|John|21|16|21|17" osisRef="Bible:John.21.16-John.21.17">John xxi.
16, 17</scripRef>.</p></note>but to love one’s neighbor worketh a keeping of the commandments,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p18">So therefore what He did before, this He doth here also.
I mean, that both there, when asked about the manner of the
resurrection, He also taught a resurrection, instruct

ing them beyond what they inquired; and here,
being asked the first commandment, He rehearses the second also, which
is not much inferior to that (for though second, it is like that),
intimating to them, whence the question had arisen, that it was from
hatred. “For charity envieth not.”<note n="2641" id="iii.LXVIII-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p19"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 4" id="iii.LXVIII-p19.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.4">1 Cor.
xiii. 4</scripRef>.</p></note> By this He shows Himself to be submissive both to the law and to the
prophets.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p20">But wherefore doth Matthew say that he asked, tempting
Him, but Mark the contrary? “For when Jesus,” he saith,
“saw that he answered discreetly, He said unto him, Thou art not
far from the kingdom of God.”<note n="2642" id="iii.LXVIII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p21"><scripRef passage="Mark xii. 34" id="iii.LXVIII-p21.1" parsed="|Mark|12|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.12.34">Mark xii.
34</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p22">They are not contradicting each other, but indeed fully
agreeing. For he asked indeed, tempting, at the beginning, but being
benefitted by the answer, was commended. For not at the beginning did
He commend him, but when he had said, “That to love his neighbor
is more than whole burnt sacrifices,” then He saith, “Thou
art not far from the kingdom;” because he overlooked low things,
and embraced the first principle of virtue. For indeed all those are
for the sake of this, as well the Sabbath as the rest.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p23">And not even so did He make His commendation perfect,
but yet deficient. For His saying, “Thou art not far off,”
indicates that he is yet falling short, that he might seek after what
was deficient.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p24">But if, when He said, “There is one God, and there
is none other but He,” He commended him, wonder not, but by this
too observe, how He answers according to the opinion of them that come
unto Him. For although men say ten thousand things about Christ
unworthy of His glory, yet this at any rate they will not dare to say,
that He is not God at all. Wherefore then doth He praise him that said,
that beside the Father, there is no other God?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p25">Not excepting Himself from being God; away with the
thought; but since it was not yet time to disclose His Godhead, He
suffers him to remain in the former doctrine, and praises him for
knowing well the ancient principles, so as to make him fit for the
doctrine of the New Testament, which He is bringing in its season.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p26">And besides, the saying, “There is one God, and
there is none other but He,” both in the Old Testament and
everywhere, is spoken not to the rejection of the Son, but to make the
distinction from idols. So that when praising this man also, who had
thus spoken, He praises him in this mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p27">Then since He had answered, He asks also in turn,
“What think ye of Christ, whose Son is He? They say unto Him, The
Son of David.”<note n="2643" id="iii.LXVIII-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 42" id="iii.LXVIII-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|22|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.42">Matt. xxii.
42</scripRef>. [R.V., “the
Christ.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p29">See after how many miracles, after how many signs, after
how many questions, after how great a display of His unanimity with the
Father, as well in words, as in deeds; after having praised this man
that said, that there is one God, He asks the question, that they may
not be able to say, that He did miracles indeed, yet was an adversary
to the law, and a foe to God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p30">Therefore, after so many things, He asks these
questions, secretly leading them on to confess Him also to be God. And
the disciples He asked first what the others say, and then themselves;
but these not so; for surely they would have said a deceiver, and a
wicked one, as speaking all things without fear. So for this cause He
inquires for the opinion of these men themselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p31">For since He was now about to go on to His passion, He
sees forth the prophecy that plainly proclaims Him to be Lord; and not
as having come to do this without occasion, nor as having made this His
aim, but from a reasonable cause.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p32">For having asked them first, since they answered not the
truth concerning Him (for they said He was a mere man), to overthrow
their mistaken opinion, He thus introduces David proclaiming His
Godhead. For they indeed supposed that He was a mere man, wherefore
also they said, “the Son of David;”<note n="2644" id="iii.LXVIII-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p33">It may be in this view that it is said of St. Paul,
immediately on his conversion, that “he preached Christ in the
synagogues, that He is the Son of God.” <scripRef passage="Acts ix. 20" id="iii.LXVIII-p33.1" parsed="|Acts|9|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.20">Acts ix. 20</scripRef>.</p></note>but He to correct this brings in the prophet witnessing to His being
Lord, and the genuineness of His Sonship, and His equality in honor
with His Father.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p34">And not even at this doth He stop, but in order to move
them to fear, He adds what followeth also, saying, “Till I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool;”<note n="2645" id="iii.LXVIII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p35"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 43" id="iii.LXVIII-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|22|43|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.43">Matt. xxii.
43</scripRef>. [The form is that of the
received text. R.V., following strongly preponderant authority,
“underneath thy feet.”—R.]</p></note>that at least in this way He might gain them over.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p36">And that they may not say, that it was in flattery he so
called Him, and that this was a human judgment, see what He saith,
“How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord?” See how
submissively He introduces the sentence and judgment concerning
Himself. First, He had said, “What think ye? Whose Son is
He?” so by a question to bring them to an answer. Then since they
said, “the Son of David,” He said not, “And yet David
saith these things,” but again in this order of a question,
“How then

<pb n="415" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_415.html" id="iii.LXVIII-Page_415" />

doth David in
spirit call Him Lord?” in order that the sayings might not give
offense to them. Wherefore neither did He say, What think ye of me, but
of Christ. For this reason the apostles also reasoned submissively,
saying, “Let us speak freely of the Patriarch David, that he is
both dead and buried.”<note n="2646" id="iii.LXVIII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p37"><scripRef passage="Acts ii. 29" id="iii.LXVIII-p37.1" parsed="|Acts|2|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.29">Acts ii.
29</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p38">And He Himself too in like manner for this cause
introduces the doctrine in the way of question and inference, saying,
“How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord
said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thy foes Thy
footstool;”<note n="2647" id="iii.LXVIII-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 44" id="iii.LXVIII-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|22|44|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.44">Matt. xxii.
44</scripRef>.</p></note>and again, “If David then call Him Lord, how is He then his
Son,”<note n="2648" id="iii.LXVIII-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 45" id="iii.LXVIII-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|22|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.45">Matt. xxii.
45</scripRef>.</p></note>not taking away the fact that He is his Son, away with the thought; for
He would not then have reproved Peter for this,<note n="2649" id="iii.LXVIII-p40.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p41">For being unwilling to admit what belonged to His
Humanity; <scripRef passage="Matt. xvi. 22, 23" id="iii.LXVIII-p41.1" parsed="|Matt|16|22|16|23" osisRef="Bible:Matt.16.22-Matt.16.23">Matt. xvi. 22,
23</scripRef>.</p></note>but to correct their secret thoughts. So that when He saith, “How
is He his Son?” He meaneth this, not so as ye say. For they said,
that He is Son only, and not also Lord. And this after the testimony,
and then submissively, “If David then call Him Lord, how is He
his Son?”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p42">But, nevertheless, even when they had heard these
things, they answered nothing, for neither did they wish to learn any
of the things that were needful. Wherefore He Himself addeth and saith,
that “He is his Lord.” Or rather not even this very thing
doth He say without support, but having taken the prophet with Him,
because of His being exceedingly distrusted by them, and evil reported
of amongst them. To which fact we ought to have especial regard, and if
anything be said by Him that is lowly and submissive, not to be
offended, for the cause is this, with many other things also, that He
talks with them in condescension.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p43">Wherefore now also He delivers His doctrine in the
manner of question and answer; but He darkly intimates even in this way
His dignity. For it was not as much to be called Lord of the Jews, as
of David.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p44">But mark thou also, I pray thee, how seasonable it is.
For when He had said, “There is one Lord,” then He spake of
Himself that He is Lord, and showed it by prophecy, no more by His
works only. And He showeth the Father Himself taking vengeance upon
them in His behalf, for He saith, “Until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool,” and great unanimity even hereby on the part of Him
that begat Him towards Himself, and honor. And upon His reasonings with
them He doth set this end high and great, and sufficient to close fast
their mouths.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p45">For they were silent from thenceforth, not willingly,
but from their having nothing to say; and they received so deadly a
blow, as no longer to dare to attempt the same things any more. For,
“no one,” it is said, “durst from that day forth ask
Him any more questions.”<note n="2650" id="iii.LXVIII-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 46" id="iii.LXVIII-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|22|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.46">Matt. xxii.
46</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p47">And this was no little advantage to the multitude.<note n="2651" id="iii.LXVIII-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p48">See the parallel place, <scripRef passage="Mark xii. 37" id="iii.LXVIII-p48.1" parsed="|Mark|12|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.12.37">Mark xii. 37</scripRef>, where it is added, “The common
people heard Him gladly.” [R.V., margin, “or, the great
multitude,” etc.]</p></note> Therefore also unto them doth He henceforth direct His word, having
removed the wolves, and having repulsed their plots.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p49">For those men gained nothing, taken captive by
vainglory, and having fallen upon this terrible passion. For terrible
is this passion and many-headed, for some set their heart upon power
for the sake of this, some on wealth, some on strength. But proceeding
in order it goes on unto almsgiving also, and fasting, and prayers, and
teaching, and many are the heads of this monster.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p50">But to be vainglorious indeed about those other things
is nothing wonderful; but to be so about fasting and prayer, this is
strange and lamentable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p51">But that we may not again blame only, come and let us
tell the means, by which we shall avoid this. Against whom shall we
prepare to contend first, against those that are vainglorious of money,
or those of dress, or those of places of power, or those of sciences,
or those of art, or those of their person, or those of beauty, or those
of ornaments, or those of cruelty, or those of humanity and almsgiving,
or those of wickedness, or those of death, or those after death? For
indeed, as I have said, this passion hath many links,<note n="2652" id="iii.LXVIII-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p52"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXVIII-p52.1">πλεκτνα</span>.</p></note>and goes on beyond our life. For such a one, it is said, is dead, and
that he may be held in admiration, hath charged that such and such
things be done; and therefore such a one is poor, such a one rich.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p53">For the grievous thing is this, that even of opposite
things is it made up.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p54">Against whom then shall we stand, and let ourselves in
array first? For one and the same discourse suffices not against all.
Will ye then that it be against them that are vainglorious about
almsgiving?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p55">To me at least it seems well; for exceedingly do I love
this thing, and am pained at seeing it marred, and vainglory plotting
against it, like a pandering nurse against some royal damsel. For she

deed, but for disgrace
and mischief, prostituting her and commanding her to despise her
father; but to deck herself to please unholy and often despicable men;
and invests her with such a dress, as strangers wish, disgraceful, and
dishonorable, not such as the father.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p56">Come now, then, let us take our aim against these; and
let there be an almsgiving made in abundance for display to the
multitude. Surely then, first vainglory leads her out of her
Father’s chamber. And whereas her Father requires not to appear
so much as to the left hand,<note n="2653" id="iii.LXVIII-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p57"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 3" id="iii.LXVIII-p57.1" parsed="|Matt|6|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.3">Matt. vi.
3</scripRef>.</p></note>she displays her to the slaves, and to the vulgar, that have not even
known her.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p58">Seest thou a harlot, and pander, casting her into the
love of foolish men, that according as they require, so she may order
herself? Dost thou desire to see how it renders such a soul not a
harlot only, but insane also?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p59">Mark then her mind. For when she lets go heaven and runs
after fugitives and menial slaves, pursuing through streets and lanes
them that hate her, the ugly and deformed, them that are not willing so
much as to look at her, them that, when she burns with love towards
them, hate her, what can be more insane than this? For no one do the
multitude hate so much, as those that want the glory they have to
bestow. Countless accusations at least do they frame against them, and
the result is the same, as if any one were to bring down a virgin
daughter of the king from the royal throne, and to require her to
prostitute herself to gladiators, who abhorred her. These then, as much
as thou pursuest them, so much do they turn away from thee; but God, if
thou seek the glory that cometh from Him, so much the more both draws
thee unto Himself, and commends thee, and great is the reward He
renders unto thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p60">But if thou art minded in another way also to discern
the mischief thereof, when thou givest for display and ostentation,
consider how great the sorrow that then comes upon thee, and how
continual the desponding, while Christ’s voice is heard in thine
ears, saying,<note n="2654" id="iii.LXVIII-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXVIII-p61"><scripRef passage="Matt. vi. 1" id="iii.LXVIII-p61.1" parsed="|Matt|6|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.6.1">Matt. vi.
1</scripRef>.</p></note>“Thou hast lost all thy reward.” For in every matter indeed
vainglory is a bad thing, yet most of all in beneficence, for it is the
utmost cruelty, making a show of the calamities of others, and all but
upbraiding those in poverty. For if to mention one’s own good
actions is to upbraid, what dost thou think it is to publish them even
to many others.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p62">How then shall we escape the danger? If we learn how to
give alms, if we see after whose good report we are to seek. For tell
me, who has the skill of almsgiving? Plainly, it is God, who hath made
known the thing, who best of all knows it, and practises it without
limit. What then? If thou art learning to be a wrestler, to whom dost
thou look? or to whom dost thou display thy doings in the wrestling
school, to the seller of herbs, and of fish, or to the trainer? And yet
they are many, and he is one. What then, if while he admires thee,
others deride thee, wilt thou not with him deride them?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p63">What, if thou art learning to box, wilt thou not look in
like manner to him who knows how to teach this? And if thou art
practising oratory, wilt thou not accept the praise of the teacher of
rhetoric, and despise the rest.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p64">How then is it other than absurd, in other arts to look
to the teacher only, but here to do the contrary? although the loss be
not equal. For there, if you wrestle according to the opinion of the
multitude, and not that of the teacher, the loss is in the wrestling;
but here it is in eternal life. Thou art become like to God in giving
alms; be thou then like Him in not making a display. For even He said,
when healing, that they should tell no man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p65">But dost thou desire to be called merciful amongst men?
And what is the gain? The gain is nothing; but the loss infinite. For
these very persons, whom thou callest to be witnesses, become robbers
of thy treasures that are in the heavens; or rather not these, but
ourselves, who spoil our own possessions, and scatter what we have laid
up above.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p66">O new calamity! this strange passion. Where moth
corrupteth not, nor thief breaketh through, vainglory scattereth. This
is the moth of those treasures there; this the thief of our wealth in
heaven; this steals away the riches that cannot be spoiled; this mars
and corrupts all. For because the devil saw that that place is
impregnable to thieves and to the worm, and the other plots against
them, he by vainglory steals away the wealth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p67">But dost thou desire glory? Doth not then that suffice
thee which is given by the receiver himself, that from our gracious
God, but dost thou set thine heart on that from men also? Take heed,
lest thou undergo the contrary, lest some condemn thee as not showing
mercy, but making a display, and seeking honor, as making a show of the
calamities of others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p68">For indeed the showing of mercy is a mystery. Shut
therefore the doors, that none may see what it is not pious to display.
For our mysteries too are above all things, a

<pb n="417" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_417.html" id="iii.LXVIII-Page_417" />

showing of God’s mercy and
loving-kindness. According to His great mercy, He had mercy on us being
disobedient.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p69">And the first prayer too is full of mercy, when we
entreat for the energumens; and the second again, for others under
penance seeking for much mercy; and the third also for ourselves, and
this puts forward the innocent children of the people entreating God
for mercy. For since we condemn ourselves for sins, for them that have
sinned much and deserve to be blamed we ourselves cry; but for
ourselves the children; for the imitators of whose simplicity the
kingdom of heaven is reserved. For this image shows this, that they who
are like those children, lowly and simple, these above all men are able
to deliver the guilty by their prayers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p70">But the mystery itself, of how much mercy, of how much
love to man it is full, the initiated know.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p71">Do thou then, when according to thy power thou art
showing mercy to a man, shut the doors, let the object of thy mercy see
it only; but if it be possible, not even he. But if thou set them open,
thou art profanely exposing thy mystery.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p72">Consider that the very person, whose praise thou
seekest, even himself will condemn thee; and if he be a friend, will
accuse thee to himself; but if an enemy, he will deride thee unto
others also. And thou wilt undergo the opposite of what thou desirest.
For thou indeed desirest that he should call thee the merciful man; but
he will not call thee this, but the vainglorious, the man-pleaser, and
other names far more grievous than these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p73">But if thou shouldest hide it, he will call thee all
that is opposite to this; the merciful, the kind. For God suffers it
not to be hidden; but if thou conceal it, the other will make it known,
and greater will be the admiration, and more abundant the gain. So that
even for this very object of being glorified, to make a display is
against us; for with respect to the thing unto which we most hasten and
press, as to this most especially is this thing against us. For so far
from obtaining the credit of being merciful, we obtain even the
contrary, and besides this, great is the loss we undergo.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXVIII-p74">For every motive then let us abstain from this, and set
our love on God’s praise alone. For thus shall we both attain to
honor here, and enjoy the eternal blessings, by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might world
without end. Amen.</p>

4</scripRef>.</p></note> But Scripture calls the whole Old Testament the law.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p9">But these things He saith, showing by all things His
full agreement with Him that begat Him. For if He were opposed, He
would have said the opposite about the law; but now He commands so
great reverence to be shown towards it, that, even when they that teach
it are depraved, He charges them to hold to it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p10">But here He is discoursing about their life

<pb n="418" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_418.html" id="iii.LXIX-Page_418" />

and morals, since this was chiefly the cause of
their unbelief, their depraved life, and the love of glory. To amend
therefore His hearers; that which in the first place most contributes
to salvation, not to despise our teachers, neither to rise up against
our priests, this doth He command with superabundant earnestness. But
He does not only command it, but also Himself doth it. For though they
were depraved, He doth not depose them from their dignity; to them
rendering their condemnation heavier, and to His disciples leaving no
cloke for disobedience.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p11">I mean, that lest any one should say, that because my
teacher is bad, therefore am I become more remiss, He takes away even
this pretext. So much at any rate did He establish their authority,
although they were wicked men, as even after so heavy an accusation to
say, “All whatsoever they command you to do, do.” For they
speak not their own words, but God’s, what He appointed for laws
by Moses. And mark how much honor He showed towards Moses, again
showing His agreement with the Old Testament; since indeed even by this
doth He make them objects of reverence. “For they sit,” He
saith, “on Moses’ seat.” For because He was not able
to make them out worthy of credit by their life, He doth it from the
grounds that were open to Him, from their seat, and their succession
from him. But when thou hearest all, do not understand all the law, as,
for instance, the ordinances about meats, those about sacrifices, and
the like; for how was He to say so of these things, which He had taken
away beforehand? but He meant all things that correct the moral
principle, and amend the disposition, and agree with the laws of the
New Testament, and suffer them not any more to be under the yoke of the
law.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p12">Wherefore then doth He give these things divine
authority, not from the law of grace, but from Moses? Because it was
not yet time, before the crucifixion, for these things to be plainly
declared.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p13">But to me He seems, in addition to what has been said,
to be providing for another object, in saying these things. For since
He was on the point of accusing them, that He might not seem in the
sight of the foolish to set His heart on this authority of theirs, or
for enmity to be doing these things, first He removed this thought, and
having set himself clear from suspicion, then begins His accusation.
And for what intent doth He convict them, and run out into a long
discourse against them? To set the multitude on their guard, so that
they might not fall into the same sins. For neither is dissuading like
pointing out those that have offended; much as recommending what is
right, is not like bringing forward those that have done well. For this
cause also He is beforehand in saying, “Do not after their
works.” For, lest they should suppose, because of their listening
to them, they ought also to imitate them, He uses this means of
correction, and makes what seems to be their dignity a charge against
them. For what can be more wretched than a teacher, when the
preservation of his disciples is, not to give heed to his life? So that
what seemeth to be their dignity is a most heavy charge against them,
when they are shown to live such a life, as they that imitate are
ruined.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p14">For this cause He also falls upon His accusations
against them, but not for this only, but that He might show, that both
their former unbelief wherewith they had not believed, and the
crucifixion after this, which they dared to perpetrate, were not a
charge against Him who was crucified and disbelieved, but against their
perverseness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p15">But see whence He begins, and whence He aggravates His
blame of them. “For they say,” He saith, “and do
not.” For every one is worthy of blame in transgressing the law,
but especially he that bears the authority of teaching, for doubly and
triply doth he deserve to be condemned. For one cause, because he
transgresses; for another, that as he ought to amend others, and then
halteth, he is worthy of a double punishment, because of his dignity;
and in the third place, that he even corrupts the more, as committing
such transgression in a teacher’s place.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p16">And together with these He mentions also another charge
against them, that they are harsh to those accountable to them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p17">“For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be
borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they will not move
them with their finger.”<note n="2658" id="iii.LXIX-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p18"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 4" id="iii.LXIX-p18.1" parsed="|Matt|23|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.4">Matt.
xxiii. 4</scripRef>. [“For,”
as in rec. text.]</p></note> He mentions here a twofold wickedness, their requiring great and
extreme strictness of life, without any indulgence, from those over
whom they rule, and their allowing to themselves great security; the
opposite to which the truly good ruler ought to hold; in what concerns
himself, to be an unpardoning and severe judge, but in the matters of
those whom he rules, to be gentle and ready to make allowances; the
contrary to which was the conduct of these men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p19">2. For such are all they who practise self restraint in
mere words, unpardoning and grievous to bear as having no experience of

<pb n="419" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_419.html" id="iii.LXIX-Page_419" />

the difficulty in actions. And
this itself too is no small fault, and in no ordinary way increases the
former charge.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p20">But do thou mark, I pray thee, how He aggravates this
accusation also. For He did not say, “they cannot,” but,
“they will not.” And He did not say, “to bear,”
but, “to move with a finger,” that is, not even to come
near them, nor to touch them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p21">But wherein are they earnest, and vigorous? In the
things forbidden. For, “all their works they do,” He saith,
“to be seen of men.”<note n="2659" id="iii.LXIX-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 5" id="iii.LXIX-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|23|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.5">Matt.
xxiii. 5</scripRef>.</p></note> These things He saith, accusing them in respect of vainglory, which
kind of thing was their ruin. For the things before were signs of
harshness and remissness, but these of the mad desire of glory. This
drew them off from God, this caused them to strive before other
spectators, and ruined them. For whatever kind of spectators any one
may have, since it hath become his study to please these, such also are
the contests he exhibits. And he that wrestles among the noble, such
also are the conflicts he takes in hand, but he among the cold and
supine, himself also becomes more remiss. For instance, hath any one a
beholder that delights in ridicule? he himself too becomes a mover of
ridicule, that he may delight the spectator: hath another one who is
earnest minded, and practises self-government? he endeavors himself to
be such as he is, since such is the disposition of him who praises
him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p23">But see again that here too the charge is with
aggravation. For neither is it that they do some things in this way,
some in another way, but all things absolutely this way.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p24">Then, having blamed them for vainglory, He shows that it
is not even about great and necessary things they are vainglorious (for
neither had they these, but were destitute of good works), but for
things without warmth or worth, and such as were certain proofs of
their baseness, the phylacteries, the borders; of their garments.
“For they make broad their phylacteries,” He saith,
“and enlarge the borders of their garments.”<note n="2660" id="iii.LXIX-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p25"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 5" id="iii.LXIX-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|23|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.5">Matt.
xxiii. 5</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p26">And what are these phylacteries, and these borders?
Since they were continually forgetting God’s benefits, He
commanded His marvellous works to be inscribed on little tablets, and
that these should be suspended from their hands (wherefore also He
said, “They shall be immoveable in thine eyes”),<note n="2661" id="iii.LXIX-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p27"><scripRef passage="Deut. vi. 8" id="iii.LXIX-p27.1" parsed="|Deut|6|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Deut.6.8">Deut. vi.

hung from their necks. And in order that by another thing again they
may be reminded, like as many often do, binding round their finger with
a piece of linen or a thread, as being likely to forget, this God
enjoined them as children to do, “to sew a ribbon of blue on
their garments, upon the fringe that hung round their feet, that they
might look at it, and remember the commandments;”<note n="2662" id="iii.LXIX-p27.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p28"><scripRef passage="Numb. xv. 38, 39" id="iii.LXIX-p28.1" parsed="|Num|15|38|15|39" osisRef="Bible:Num.15.38-Num.15.39">Numb. xv.
38, 39</scripRef>. [The passage is
freely given from the <span class="c20" id="iii.LXIX-p28.2">LXX</span>.]</p></note>and they were called “borders.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p29">In these things then they were diligent, making wide the
strips of the tablets, and enlarging the borders of their garments;
which was a sign of the most extreme vanity. For wherefore art thou
vainglorious, and dost make these wide? what, is this thy good work?
what doth it profit thee at all, if thou gain not the good results from
them. For God seeks not the enlarging of these and making them wide,
but our remembering His benefits. But if for almsgiving and prayer,
although they be attended with labor, and be good deeds on our parts,
we must not seek vainglory, how dost thou, O Jew, pride thyself in
these things, which most of all convict thy remissness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p30">But they not in these only, but in other little things,
suffered from this disease.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p31">For, “they love,” He saith, “the
uppermost rooms<note n="2663" id="iii.LXIX-p31.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p32">[R.V., “the chief place.”]</p></note>at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the
markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi.”<note n="2664" id="iii.LXIX-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p33">[With the oldest New Testament <span class="c20" id="iii.LXIX-p33.1">mss</span>. the word “Rabbi” is not
repeated.—R.]</p></note> For these things, although one may think them small, yet are they a
cause of great evils. These things have overthrown both cities and
churches.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p34">And it comes upon me now even to weep, when I hear of
the first seats, and the greetings, and consider how many ills were
hence engendered to the churches of God, which it is not necessary to
publish to you now; nay rather as many as are aged men do not even need
to learn these things from us.<note n="2665" id="iii.LXIX-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p35">This passage has afforded grounds for a conjecture
as to the date of the Homily, but the language is too general to prove
anything; see Montfaucon’s Preface.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p36">But mark thou, I pray thee, how vainglory prevailed;
when they were commanded not to be vainglorious, even in the
synagogues, where they had entered to discipline others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p37">For to have this feeling at feasts, to howsoever great a
degree, doth not seem to be so dreadful a thing; although even there
the teachers ought to be held in reverence, and not in the church only,
but everywhere. And like as a man, wherever he may appear, is
manifestly distinguished from the brutes; so also ought the teacher,
both speaking and

<pb n="420" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_420.html" id="iii.LXIX-Page_420" />

holding his
peace, and dining, and doing whatever it may be, to be distinguished as
well by his gait, as by his look, and by his garb, and by all things
generally. But they were on every account objects of ridicule, and in
every respect disgraced themselves, making it their study to follow
what they ought to flee. For they love them, it is said; but if the
loving them be a matter of blame, what a thing must the doing them be;
and to hunt and strive after them, how great an evil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p38">3. The other things then He carried no further than to
accuse them, as being small and trifling, and as though His disciples
needed not at all to be corrected about these matters; but what was a
cause of all the evils, even ambition, and the violent seizing of the
teacher’s chair, this He brings forward, and corrects with
diligence, touching this vehemently and earnestly charging them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p39">For what saith He? “But be not ye called
Rabbi.” Then follows the cause also; “For one is your
master, and all ye are brethren;”<note n="2666" id="iii.LXIX-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 8" id="iii.LXIX-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|23|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.8">Matt.

call Father, in the highest sense. For like as the master is not a
master principally; so neither is the father. For He is cause of all,
both of the masters, and of the fathers.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p43">And again He adds, “Neither be ye called guides,
for one is your guide, even Christ;”<note n="2669" id="iii.LXIX-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p44"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 10" id="iii.LXIX-p44.1" parsed="|Matt|23|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.10">Matt.

rendered “Master” in our English versions, but
“guide” is more literal; “the Christ” (R.V.),
is preferable, especially in view of the context here.—R.]</p></note>and He said not, I. For like as above He said, “What think ye of
Christ?”<note n="2670" id="iii.LXIX-p44.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 42" id="iii.LXIX-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|22|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.42">Matt. xxii.
42</scripRef>. [R.V., “the
Christ.”]</p></note>and He said not, “of me,” so here too.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p46">But I should be glad to ask here, what they would say,
who are repeatedly applying the term one, one, to the Father alone, to
the rejection of the Only-begotten. Is the Father guide? All would
declare it, and none would gainsay it. And yet “one,” He
saith, “is your guide, even Christ.” For like as Christ,
being called the one guide, casts not out the Father from being guide;
even so the Father, being called Master, doth not cast out the Son from
being Master. For the expression, one, one, is spoken in
contradistinction to men, and the rest of the creation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p47">Having warned them therefore against this grievous pest,
and amended them, He instructs also how they may escape it; by
humility. Wherefore He adds also, “He that is greatest among you
shall be your servant. For whosoever shall exalt himself shall be
abased, and whosoever shall abase himself shall be exalted.”<note n="2671" id="iii.LXIX-p47.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p48"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 11, 12" id="iii.LXIX-p48.1" parsed="|Matt|23|11|23|12" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.11-Matt.23.12">Matt.

both “abase” and “humble.”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p49">For nothing is equal to the practice of modesty,
wherefore He is continually reminding them of this virtue, both when He
brought the children into the midst, and now. And, when on the mount,
beginning the beatitudes, He began from hence. And in this place, He
plucks it up by the roots hereby, saying, “He that abaseth
himself shall be exalted.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p50">Seest thou how He draws off the hearer right over to the
contrary thing. For not only doth He forbid him to set his heart upon
the first place, but requires him to follow after the last. For so
shalt thou obtain thy desire, He saith. Wherefore he that pursues his
desire for the first, must follow after the last place. “For he
that abaseth himself shall be exalted.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p51">And where shall we find this humility? Will ye that we
go again to the city of virtue, the tents of the holy men, the
mountains, I mean, and the groves? For there too shall we see this
height of humility.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p52">For men, some illustrious from their rank in the world,
some from their wealth, in every way put themselves down, by their
vesture, by their dwelling, by those to whom they minister; and, as in
written characters, they throughout all things inscribe humility.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p53">And the things that are incentives of arrogance, as to
dress well, and to build houses splendidly, and to have many servants,
things which often drive men even against their will to arrogance;
these are all taken away. For they themselves light their fire, they
themselves cleave the logs, themselves cook, themselves minister to
those that come there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p54">No one can be heard insulting there, nor seen insulted,
nor commanded, nor giving commands; but all are devoted to those that
are waited on, and every one washes the strangers’ feet, and
there is much contention about this. And he doeth it, not inquiring who
it is, neither if he be a slave, nor if he be free; but in the case of
every one fulfills this service. No man there is great nor mean. What
then? Is there confusion? Far from it, but the highest order. For if
any one be mean, he that is great seeth not this, but hath accounted
himself again to be inferior even to him, and so becomes great.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p55">There is one table for all, both for them that are
served, and for them that serve; the

<pb n="421" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_421.html" id="iii.LXIX-Page_421" />

same food, the same clothes, the same
dwellings, the same manner of life. He is great there, who eagerly
seizes the mean task. There is not mine and thine, but this expression
is exterminated, that is a cause of countless wars.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p56">4. And why dost thou marvel, if there be one manner of
life and table and dress for all, since indeed there is even one soul
to all, not in substance only (for this is with all men also), but in
love? how then should it ever be lifted up itself against itself? There
is no wealth and poverty there, honor and dishonor; how then should
haughtiness and arrogance find an entrance? For they are indeed little
and great in respect of their virtue; but, as I have said, no one seeth
this. He that is little, feels not pain, as despised; for neither is
there any one to despise him; and should any one spurn him, this above
all are they taught, to be despised, to be spurned, to be set at
nought, in word and in deed. And with the poor and maimed do they
associate, and their tables are full of these guests; so that for this
are they worthy of the heavens. And one tends the wounds of the
mutilated, another leads the blind by the hand, a third bears him that
is lamed of his leg.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p57">There is no multitude of flatterers or parasites there;
or rather they know not even what flattery is; whence then could they
be lifted up at any time? For there is great equality amongst them,
wherefore also there is much facility for virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p58">For by these are they of an inferior sort better
instructed, than if they were compelled to give up the first place to
them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p59">For like as the impetuous man derives instruction from
him that is smitten, and submits to it; so the ambitious from him that
claims not glory, but despises it. This they do there abundantly, and
as the strife is great with us to obtain the first place, so great is
it with them not to obtain it, but utterly to refuse it; and great is
their earnest desire who shall have the advantage in honoring, not in
being honored.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p60">And besides, even their very employments persuade them
to practise moderation, and not to be high-swollen. For who, I pray
thee, digging in the earth, and watering, and planting, or making
baskets, or weaving sackcloth, or practising any other handy works,
will ever be proud? Who dwelling in poverty and wrestling with hunger,
will ever be sick of this disease? There is not one. Therefore humility
is easy to them. And like as here, it is a hard thing to be lowly
minded, for the multitude of them who applaud and admire us, so there
it is exceedingly easy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p61">And that man gives heed only to the wilderness, and sees
birds flying, and trees waving, and a breeze blowing, and streams
rushing through glens. Whence then should he be lifted up who dwells in
solitude so great?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p62">Not however that therefore we have from this an excuse,
in that we are proud when living in the midst of men. For surely
Abraham, when amidst Canaanites, said, “I am but dust and
ashes;”<note n="2672" id="iii.LXIX-p62.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXIX-p63"><scripRef passage="Gen. xviii. 27" id="iii.LXIX-p63.1" parsed="|Gen|18|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.18.27">Gen. xviii.

great examples, we do not practise moderation? For even as they are
worthy of countless crowns, having been the first that went the way of
virtue, even so are we deserving of countless punishments, who not even
after those that are departed, and are set before us in books, no nor
even after these that are living, and held in admiration through their
deeds, are drawn on to the like emulation.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p67">For what couldest thou say, for not being amended? Art
thou ignorant of letters, and hast not looked into the Scriptures that
thou mightest learn the virtues of them of old? To say the truth, this
is itself blameworthy, when the church is constantly standing open, not
to enter in, and partake of those sacred streams.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p68">However, although thou know not the departed by the
Scriptures, these living men thou oughtest to see. But is there no one
to lead thee? Come to me, and I will show thee the places of refuge of
these holy men; come and learn thou of them something useful. Shining
lamps are these in every part of the earth; as walls are they set about
the cities. For this cause have they occupied the deserts, that they
may instruct thee to despise the tumults in the midst of the world.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXIX-p69">For they, as being strong, are able even in the midst of
the raging of the waters to enjoy a calm; but thou, who art leaky on
every side, hast need of tranquility, and to take breath a little,
after the successive waves. Go then there continually, that, having
purged away the abiding stain by their prayers and admonitions, thou
mayest both pass in the best manner the present life, and attain unto
the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, be unto the Father, together with
the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.LXX-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.LXX-p5.1">After</span> this, next He derides
them for gluttony: and the grievous thing was, that not from rich
men’s goods, but from the poor they indulged their own belly, and
aggravated their poverty, which they should have relieved. For neither
did they merely eat, but devoured.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p6">Moreover also the manner of their overreaching was yet
more grievous, “for a pretense making long prayers.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p7">For every one is worthy of vengeance who doeth any evil
thing; but he that is deriving even the reason for so doing from
godliness, and is using this cloke for his wickedness, is justly liable
to a far more grievous punishment. And wherefore did He not depose
them? Because the time suffered it not as yet. So therefore He lets
them alone for a time, but by His sayings, He secures that the people
be not deceived, lest, through the dignity of those men, they be drawn
on to the same emulation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p8">For as He had said, “Whatsoever they bid you do,
that do;” He shows how many things they do amiss, lest from
thence He should be supposed amongst the unwise to commit all to

hinder, what plea hath that? But what means, “them that are
entering in?” Them that are fit for it. For when they were to lay
injunctions on others, they used to make the burdens intolerable, but
when they themselves were to do any of the things required, on the
contrary, so far from doing anything, they went much beyond this in
wickedness, they even used to corrupt others. These are they that are
called pests,<note n="2678" id="iii.LXX-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p11"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXX-p11.1">λοιμο</span>.</p></note>who make their employment the ruin of others, standing right contrary
to teachers. For if it be the part of a teacher to save that which is
perishing, to destroy that which is on the point of being saved is that
of a destroyer.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p12">After this, again another charge: “Ye compass sea
and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him
twofold more the child of hell than yourselves;”<note n="2679" id="iii.LXX-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p13"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 15" id="iii.LXX-p13.1" parsed="|Matt|23|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.15">Matt.

son of hell,” with the margin, “Greek, Gehenna.”]</p></note>that is, not even the fact that hardly ye have taken him, and with
endless toils, induces you to be sparing towards him, although of the
things we have hardly acquired, we are more sparing, but you not even
this renders more gentle.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p14">Here He lays to their charge two things; one, that they
are unprofitable for the salvation of the many, and need much toil in
order to win over even one; another, that they were remiss in the
preservation of him whom they had gained, or rather that they were not
only careless, but even traitors, by their wickedness in their life
corrupting him, and making him worse. For when the disciple sees his
teachers to be such as these, he becomes worse than they. For he stops
not at his teacher’s wickedness; but as when his teacher is
virtuous, he imitates him, so when he is bad, he even goes beyond him,
by reason of our proneness to what is evil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p15">And He calls him “a child of hell,” that is,
a very hell. And He said “twofold more than you,” that He
might both alarm those, and make these feel the more severely, because
they are teachers of wickedness. And not this only, but because they
labor to instill into their disciples a greater wickedness, hardening
them to a much greater depravity than they have, and this is above all
a mark of a depraved soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p16">Then He derides them for folly also, because they bade
them disregard the greater commandments. And yet before He had said the
opposite, that “they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be
borne.” But these things too they did again and were doing
everything for the corruption of those

<pb n="423" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_423.html" id="iii.LXX-Page_423" />

who were subject to them, in little things
requiring strictness, and despising the great.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p17">“For ye pay tithe,” He saith, “of mint
and anise, and have omitted<note n="2680" id="iii.LXX-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p18">[R.V., “have left undone.”]</p></note>the weightier matters of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith. These
ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others undone.”<note n="2681" id="iii.LXX-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p19"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 23" id="iii.LXX-p19.1" parsed="|Matt|23|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.23">Matt.
xxiii. 23</scripRef>. [R.V., “to
have left the others undone.” “And cummin” is
omitted.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p20">Here then He naturally saith it, where it is tithe and
almsgiving, for what doth it hurt to give alms? But not to keep the
law; for neither doth it say thus. Therefore here indeed He saith,
“These ought ye to have done;” but where He is speaking
about clean and unclean, He no longer adds this, but makes a
distinction, and shows that the inward purity is necessarily followed
by the outward, but the converse is no longer so.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p21">For where there is a plea of love to man, He passes it
over lightly, for this very reason, and because it was not yet time
expressly and plainly to revoke the things of the law. But where it is
an observance of bodily purification, He overthrows it more
plainly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p22">So, therefore, while with respect to alms He saith,
“These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others
undone,” touching purifications He speaks not on this wise, but
what? “Ye make clean,” He saith, “the outside of the
cup and the platter, but within they are full of extortion, and
injustice. Cleanse that which is within the cup, that the outside may
be clean also.”<note n="2682" id="iii.LXX-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p23"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 25, 26" id="iii.LXX-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|23|25|23|26" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.25-Matt.23.26">Matt.
xxiii. 25, 26</scripRef>. [The minor
textual variations appear in the above English rendering.]</p></note> And He took it from a thing confessed and manifest, from a cup and
platter.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p24">2. Then, to show that there is no harm arising from
despising bodily cleansings, but very great vengeance from not
regarding the purifications of the soul, which is virtue, He called
these “a gnat,” for they are small and nothing, but those
other a camel, for they were beyond what men could bear. Wherefore also
He saith, “Straining at the gnat, and swallowing the
camel.”<note n="2683" id="iii.LXX-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p25">[<scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 24" id="iii.LXX-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|23|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.24">Matt.
xxiii. 24</scripRef>. R.V., correctly,
“strain out the gnat,” etc.]</p></note> For indeed the one were enacted for the sake of the other, I mean of
mercy and judgment; so that not even then did they profit being done
alone. For whereas the little things were mentioned for the sake of the
great, and after that these last were neglected, and labor was spent on
those alone, nothing was gained even then by this. For the greater
followed not the lesser, but the lesser were sure to follow these
greater.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p26">But these things He saith to show, that even before
grace was come, these were not among the principal things, or amongst
those upon which men should spend their labor, but the matters required
were different. But if before the grace they were so, much more when
high commandments had come, were these things unprofitable, and it was
not meet to practise them at all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p27">In every case then is vice a grievous thing, but
especially when it does not so much as think it needs amendment; and it
is yet more grievous, when it thinks itself sufficient even to amend
others; to express which Christ calls them “blind guides.”
For if for a blind man not to think he needs a guide be extreme misery
and wretchedness; when he wishes himself to guide others, see to what a
gulf it leads.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p28">But these things He said, by all intimating their mad
desire of glory, and their exceeding frenzy concerning this pest. For
this became a cause to them of all their evils, namely, that they did
all things for display. This both led them away from the faith, and
caused them to neglect what really is virtue, and induced them to busy
themselves about bodily purifyings only, neglecting the purifications
of the soul. So therefore to lead them into what really is virtue, and
to the purifyings of the soul, He makes mention of mercy, and judgment,
and faith. For these are the things that comprise our life, these are
what purify the soul, justice, love to man, truth; the one inclining us
to pardon<note n="2684" id="iii.LXX-p28.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p29">[The Oxford edition has “candor,”

that sin (for then shall we gain doubly, both becoming kind to man, and
hence meeting also ourselves with much kindness from the God of all),
and causing us both to sympathize with them that are despitefully
entreated, and to assist them; the other not suffering them to be
deceitful, and crafty.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p30">But neither when He saith, “These ought ye to have
done, and not to leave the others undone,” doth He say it as

“Cleanse that which is within the cup and platter, that the
outside of them may be clean also,” doth He bring us unto the old
regard for little things, but on the contrary indeed, He doth all
things to show it to be superfluous. For He said not, Cleanse the
outside of them also, but that which is within, and the outside is sure
to follow.</p>

he is speaking, but of soul and body, by the outside meaning the body,

of that which is within much more with regard to thee.</p>

cause of all their evils, and the origin of their ruin. And He did not
merely call them whited sepulchers, but said, that they were full of
uncleanness and hypocrisy. And these things He spake, indicating the
cause wherefore they did not believe, because they were full of
hypocrisy and iniquity.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p36">But these things not Christ only, but the prophets also
constantly lay to their charge, that they spoil, that their rulers
judge not according to the rule of justice, and every where you may
find the sacrifices indeed refused, but these things required. So that
there is nothing strange, nothing new, neither in the lawgiving, nor in
the accusation, nay not even in the comparison of the sepulchre. For
the prophet makes mention thereof, neither did he call them merely a
sepulchre, “but their throat an open sepulchre.”<note n="2687" id="iii.LXX-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p37"><scripRef passage="Ps. v. 9" id="iii.LXX-p37.1" parsed="|Ps|5|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.5.9">Ps. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p38">Such are many men now also, decking themselves indeed
outwardly, but full of iniquity within. For now too there is many a
mode, and many a care for outward purifications, but of those in the
soul not so much as one. But if indeed any one should tear open each
man’s conscience, many worms and much corruption would he find,
and an ill savor beyond utterance; unreasonable and wicked lusts I
mean, which are more unclean than worms.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p39">3. But that “they” should be such persons is
not “so” dreadful a thing (although it be dreadful), but
that “you,” that have been counted worthy to become temples
of God, should of a sudden have become sepulchers, having as much ill
savor, this is extreme wretchedness. He in whom Christ dwells, and the
Holy Spirit hath worked, and such great mysteries, that this man should
be a sepulchre, what wretchedness is this? What mournings and
lamentations doth this call for, when the members of Christ have become
a tomb of uncleanness? Consider how thou wast born, of what things thou
hast been counted worthy, what manner of garment thou hast received,
how thou wast built a temple without a breach! how fair! not adorned
with gold, neither with pearls, but with the spirit that is more
precious than these.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p40">Consider that no sepulchre is made in a city, so then
neither shalt thou be able to appear in the city above. For if here
this is forbidden, much more there. Or rather even here thou art an
object of scorn to all, bearing about a dead soul, and not to be
scorned only, but also to be shunned. For tell me, if any one were to
go round, bearing about a dead body, would not all have rushed away?
would not all have fled? Think this now likewise. For thou goest about,
bearing a spectacle far more grievous than this, a soul deadened by
sins, a soul paralyzed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p41">Who now will pity such a one? For when thou dost not
pity thine own soul, how shall another pity him that is so cruel, such
an enemy to himself?<note n="2688" id="iii.LXX-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p42">[<span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXX-p42.1">πολμιον ντα

what wouldest thou not have done? but thou art burying a dead soul, not
where thou dinest, nor where thou sleepest, but in the members of
Christ: and art thou not afraid lest a thousand lightnings and
thunderbolts be hurled from above upon thine head?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p43">And how dost thou even dare to set foot in the churches
of God, and in holy temples, having within thee the savor of so much
abomination? For if one bearing a dead body into the king’s
courts and burying it would have suffered the utmost punishment, thou
setting thy foot in the sacred courts, and filling the house with so
much ill savor, consider what a punishment thou wilt undergo.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p44">Imitate that harlot who anointed with ointment the feet
of Christ, and filled the whole house with the odor, the opposite to
which thou doest to His house! For what though thou be not sensible of
the ill savor? For this most of all is the grievous part of the
disease; wherefore also thou art incurably diseased, and more
grievously than they that are maimed in their bodies, and become fetid.
For that disease indeed is both felt by the sick and is without any
blame, nay even is deserving of pity; but this of hatred and
punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p45">Since then both in this respect it is more grievous, and

it as he ought to be; come, give thyself to my words, that I may teach
thee plainly the mischief of it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p46">But first listen to what thou sayest in the Psalm,
“Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as incense.”<note n="2689" id="iii.LXX-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p47"><scripRef passage="Ps. cxli. 2" id="iii.LXX-p47.1" parsed="|Ps|41|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.41.2">Ps. cxli.

thy deeds, what punishment dost thou not deserve to undergo?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p48">What then is the stinking smoke? Many come in gazing
about at the beauty of women; others curious about the blooming youth
of boys. After this, dost thou not marvel, how bolts are not launched,
and all things are not plucked up from their foundations? For worthy
both of thunderbolts and hell are the things that are done; but God,
who is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forbears awhile His wrath,
calling thee to repentance and amendment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p49">What doest thou, O man? Art thou curiously looking after
women’s beauty, and dost thou not shudder at thus doing despite
unto the temple of God? Doth the church seem to thee a brothel, and
less honorable than the market-place. For in a market-place indeed thou
art afraid and ashamed to appear to be looking after any woman, but in
God’s temple, when God Himself is discoursing unto thee, and
threatening about these things, thou art committing whoredom and
adultery at the very time in which thou art being told not to do this.
And dost thou not shudder, nor stand amazed?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p50">These things do the spectacles of wantonness teach you,
the pest that is so hard to put down, the deleterious sorceries, the
grievous snares of the thoughtless, the pleasurable destruction of the
unchaste.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p51">Therefore the prophet also blaming thee, said,
“Thine eyes are not good, neither is thine heart.”<note n="2690" id="iii.LXX-p51.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p52"><scripRef passage="Jer. xxii. 17" id="iii.LXX-p52.1" parsed="|Jer|22|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.22.17">Jer. xxii.

Because the men were men, and the women women, but now altogether the
contrary; the women have urged themselves into the manners of
courtezans, but the men are in no better state than frantic horses.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p57">Heard ye not, that the men and women were gathered
together in the upper room, and that congregation was worthy of the
heavens? And very reasonably. For even women then practised much
self-denial, and the men gravity and chastity. Hear, for instance, the
seller of purple saying, “If ye have judged me to be faithful to
the Lord, come in, and abide with me.”<note n="2693" id="iii.LXX-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p58"><scripRef passage="Acts xvi. 15" id="iii.LXX-p58.1" parsed="|Acts|16|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.15">Acts xvi.

themselves manly courage, Priscilla, Persis, and the rest; from whom
our present women are as far removed as our men from their men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p59">4. For then indeed even travelling into far countries
women brought not on themselves evil report; but now even though
brought up in a chamber, they hardly escape this suspicion. But these
things arise from their decking of themselves, and their luxury. Then
the business of those women was to spread the word; but now to appear
beauteous, and fair, and comely in countenance. This is glory to them,
this salvation; but of lofty and great works they do not even
dream.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p60">What woman exerts herself to make her husband better?
what man hath taken to himself this care to amend his wife? There is
not one: but the woman’s whole study is upon the care of
ornaments of gold, and raiment, and the other adornments of the person,
and how to increase their substance; but the man’s both this, and
others more than this, all however worldly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p61">Who, when about to marry, inquires about the disposition
and nurture of the damsel? No one; but straightway about money, and
possessions, and measures of property of various and different kinds;
like as if he were about to buy something, or to settle some common
contract.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p62">Therefore they do even so call marriage. For I have
heard many say, such a man has contracted with such a woman, that is,
has married. And they offer insult to the gifts of God, and as though
buying and selling, so do they marry, and are given in marriage.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p63">And writings there are, requiring greater security than
those about buying and selling. Learn how those of old married, and
imitate them. How then did they marry? They inquired about ways of
life, and morals, and virtue of the soul. Therefore they had no need of
writings, nor of security by parch

ment and ink; for the bride’s disposition
sufficed them in the place of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p64">I therefore entreat you likewise not to seek after
wealth and affluence, but a good disposition, and gentleness. Seek for
a pious and self-denying damsel, and these will be to thee better than
countless treasures. If thou seek the things of God, these others will
come also; but if thou pass by those, and hasten unto these, neither
will these follow.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p65">But such a man, one will say, became rich by his wife!
Art thou not ashamed of bringing forward such examples? I had ten
thousand times sooner become a poor man, as I have heard many say, than
gain wealth from a wife. For what can be more unpleasing than that
wealth? What more painful than the abundance? What more shameful than
to be notorious from thence, and for it to be said by all, such a man
became rich by a wife? For the domestic discomforts I pass by, all that
must needs result from hence, the wife’s pride, the servility,
the strifes, the reproaches of the servants. “The beggar,”
“the ragged one,” “the base one, and sprung of
base.” “Why, what had he when he came in?” “Do
not all things belong to our mistress?” But thou dost not care at
all about these sayings, for neither art thou a freeman. Since the
parasites likewise hear worse things than these, and are not pained
wherefore neither are these, but rather pride themselves in their
disgrace; and when we tell them of these things, “Let me
have,” saith one of them, “something pleasant and sweet,
and let it choke me.” Alas! the devil, what proverbs hath he
brought into the world, of power to overturn the whole life of such
persons. See at least this self-same devilish and pernicious saying; of
how much ruin it is full. For it means nothing else than these words,
Have thou no regard to what is honorable; have thou no regard to what
is just; let all those things be cast aside, seek one thing alone,
pleasure. Though the thing stifle thee, let it be thy choice; though
all that meet thee spurn thee, though they smear thy face with mire,
though they drive thee away as a dog, bear all. And what else would
swine say, if they had a voice? What else would filthy dogs? But
perhaps not even they would have said such things, as the devil hath
persuaded men to rave.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p66">Wherefore I entreat you, being conscious of the
senselessness of such words as these, to flee such proverbs, and to
choose out those in the Scriptures that are contrary to them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p67">But what are these? “Go not,” it is said,
“after thy lusts, and refrain thyself from thine
appetites.”<note n="2694" id="iii.LXX-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p68"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 18.30" id="iii.LXX-p68.1" parsed="|Sir|18|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.18.30">Ecclus. xviii. 30</scripRef>.</p></note> And, touching an harlot again, it is said in opposition to this
proverb, “Give not heed to a bad woman: for honey droppeth from
the lips of a woman that is an harlot, which, for a season, is luscious
unto thy throat; but afterwards thou shalt find it more bitter than
gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword.”<note n="2695" id="iii.LXX-p68.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXX-p69"><scripRef passage="Prov. v. 2-4" id="iii.LXX-p69.1" parsed="|Prov|5|2|5|4" osisRef="Bible:Prov.5.2-Prov.5.4">Prov. v.

spring our mean, hence our slavish thoughts, hence men become brutes,
because in everything they will follow after pleasure according to this
proverb, which, even without arguments of ours, is of itself
ridiculous. For after one is choked, what is the gain of sweetness?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXX-p70">Cease, therefore, to set up such great absurdity, and to
kindle hell and unquenchable fire; and let us look steadfastly (at
length though late) as we ought, unto the things to come, having put
away the film on our eyes, that we may both pass the present life
honestly, and with much reverence and godly fear, and attain unto the
good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

both thus, and by what they say, they are pretending to condemn their
fathers, they do worse. For in proof that the condemnation was a
pretense, Luke saith, ye do allow because ye build; for, “Woe
unto you,” saith He, “for ye build the sepulchers of the
prophets, and your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witness, and ye
allow the deeds of your fathers, for they indeed killed them, and ye
build their sepulchers.”<note n="2697" id="iii.LXXI-p4.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p5"><scripRef passage="Luke xi. 47, 48" id="iii.LXXI-p5.1" parsed="|Luke|11|47|11|48" osisRef="Bible:Luke.11.47-Luke.11.48">Luke xi.

not for the honoring of them that were slain, but as making a show of
the murders, and afraid, lest, when the tombs had perished by time, the
proof and memory of such daring should fade away, setting up these
glorious buildings, as a kind of trophy, and priding themselves in the
daring deeds of those men, and displaying them.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p6">For the things that ye now dare to do, show that ye do
these things also in this spirit. For, though ye speak the contrary,
saith He, as condemning them, as, for instance, “We should not,
if we had been in their days, have been partakers with them;” yet
the disposition is evident wherewith ye say these things. Wherefore
also unfolding it, though darkly, still He hath expressed it. For when
He had said, ye say, “If we had been in the days of our fathers,
we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets;” He added, “Wherefore ye be witnesses unto
yourselves, that ye are the children of them that slew the
prophets.” And what blame is it to be a murderer’s son, if
one partake not in the mind of one’s father? None. Whence it is
evident, that for this same thing He brings it forward against them,
hinting at their affinity in wickedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p7">And this is manifest too by what comes after; He adds at
least, “Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers.”<note n="2698" id="iii.LXXI-p7.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p8"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 33" id="iii.LXXI-p8.1" parsed="|Matt|23|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.33">Matt.

their venom, so also are ye like your fathers in murderousness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p9">Then, because He was searching their temper of mind,
which is to the more part obscure, He doth, from those things also
which they were about to perpetrate, which would be manifest to all,
establish His words. For, because He had said, “Wherefore ye be
witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed
the prophets,” making it evident, that of their affinity in
wickedness He is speaking, and that it was a pretense to say, “We
should not have been partakers with them,” He added, “Fill
ye up therefore the measure of your fathers,”<note n="2699" id="iii.LXXI-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 32" id="iii.LXXI-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|23|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.32">Matt.

having shown that they were pretenses which they said in their own
defense, as, for instance, “We would not have been partakers with
them,” (for they who refrain not from the Lord, how should they
have refrained from the servants), He makes after this His language

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p14">Then rebuking them more exceedingly from another cause
also, He saith, “I will send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
scribes, and some of them shall ye kill and crucify, and some of them
shall ye scourge in your synagogues.”<note n="2702" id="iii.LXXI-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p15"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiii. 34" id="iii.LXXI-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|23|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.34">Matt.

“Behold,” He saith, “I send servants also to you,

But these things He saith, showing that it was nothing strange, that He
should

be murdered by those sons,
being both murderous and deceitful, and having much guile, and
surpassing their fathers in their outrages.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p16">And besides what hath been said, He shows them to be
also exceedingly vainglorious. For when they say, “If we had been
in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with
them,” they spake out of vainglory, and were practising virtue in
words only, but in their works doing the contrary.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p17">Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, that is, wicked
sons of wicked men, and more wicked than those who begat them. For He
showeth that they are committing greater crimes, both by their
committing them after those others, and by their doing much more
grievous things than they, and this, while positively affirming that
they never would have fallen into the same. For they add that which is
both the end and the crown of their evil deeds. For the others slew
them that came to the vineyard, but these, both the son, and them that
were bidding them to the wedding.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p18">But these things He saith, to separate them off from the
affinity to Abraham, and to show that they had no advantage from
thence, unless they followed his works; wherefore also He adds,
“How can ye flee<note n="2703" id="iii.LXXI-p18.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p19">[“escape,” as before, the verb being the

committed such acts?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p20">And here He recalls to their remembrance John’s
accusation, for he too called them by this name, and reminded them of
the judgment to come. Then, because they are nothing alarmed by
judgment and hell, by reason of their not believing them, and because
the thing is future, He awes them by the things present, and saith,

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p24">2. See by how many things He has warned them. He said,
Ye condemn your fathers, in that ye say, “We would not have been
partakers with them;” and this is no little thing to shame them.
He said, While ye condemn them, ye do worse things, even ye yourselves;
and this is sufficient to cover them with disgrace. He said, These
things shall not be without punishment; and hence he implants in them
fear beyond words. He hath reminded them at least of hell. Then because
that was to come, He brought home to them the terrors as even present.
“For all these things shall come,” He saith, “upon
this generation.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p25">He added also unspeakable severity to the vengeance,
saying, that they shall suffer more grievous things than all; yet by
none of these things did they become better. But if any one say, And
why do they suffer more grievously than all? we would say, Because they
have first committed more grievous things than all, and by none of the
things that have been done to them have they been brought to a sound
mind.</p>

your fathers suffered, when they slew the prophets; were they not
delivered over to punishments, and inflictions of vengeance without

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p33">But do thou mark this, that the outrage was twofold. For
not only did they slay holy men, but also in a holy place. And saying
these things, He did not only alarm them, but also comfort His
disciples, showing that the righteous men also who were before them
suffered these things. But these He alarmed, foretelling that like as
they paid their penalty, even so should these too suffer the utmost
extremities. Therefore He calls them<note n="2711" id="iii.LXXI-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p34">[That is, “His disciples.”]</p></note>“prophets, and wise men, and scribes,” even hereby again
taking away every plea of theirs. “For ye cannot say,” He
saith, “Thou didst send from among the Gentiles, and therefore we
were offended;” but they were led on unto this by being
murderous, and thirsting for blood. Wherefore He also said beforehand,
“For this cause do I send prophets and scribes.” This did
the prophets also lay to their charge, saying, “They mingle blood
with blood,”<note n="2712" id="iii.LXXI-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p35"><scripRef passage="Hosea iv. 2" id="iii.LXXI-p35.1" parsed="|Hos|4|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.4.2">Hosea iv.

to be offered to Him, showing that if in a brute it be thus precious,
much more in a man. Which He saith to Noah likewise, “I will
require all blood that is shed.”<note n="2713" id="iii.LXXI-p35.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p36"><scripRef passage="Gen. ix. 5" id="iii.LXXI-p36.1" parsed="|Gen|9|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.9.5">Gen. ix.

regard to their not committing murder; wherefore He commanded them not
even to eat that which was strangled.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p37">Oh the love of God towards man! that though He foreknew
they would profit nothing, He still doeth His part. For I will send, He
saith, and this knowing they would be slain. So that even hereby they
were convicted of saying vainly, “We should not have been
partakers with our fathers.” For these too slew prophets even in
their synagogues, and reverenced neither the place, nor the dignity of
the persons. For not merely ordinary persons did they slay, but
prophets and wise men, such that they had nothing to lay to their
charge. And by these He meaneth the apostles, and those after them,
for, indeed, many prophesied. Then, willing to aggravate their fears,
He saith, “Verily, verily I say unto you, All these things shall
come upon this generation;” that is, I will bring all upon your
heads, and will make the vengeance sore. For he that knew many to have
sinned, and was not sobered, but himself hath committed the same sins
again, and not the same only, but also far more grievous, would justly
deserve to suffer a far more grievous punishment than they. For like
as, if he had been minded, he would have gained greatly, had he grown
better by their examples, even so, since he continued without
amendment, he is liable to a heavier vengeance, as having had the
benefit of more warning by them who had sinned before and been
punished, and having reaped no advantage.</p>

about to inflict the punishment. Which He doth in the prophets also,
using these words, “I said, Turn thou unto me, and she returned
not.”<note n="2715" id="iii.LXXI-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p40"><scripRef passage="Jer. iii. 7" id="iii.LXXI-p40.1" parsed="|Jer|3|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.3.7">Jer. iii.

I have gathered thy children together, and ye would not,” in this
way also pleading for His own dealings; not even with these things hast
thou turned me aside, nor withdrawn me from my great affection toward
thee, but it was my desire even so, not once or twice, but often to
draw thee unto me. “For how often would I have gathered your
children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would

indeed the creature is warm in its love towards its brood. And
everywhere in the prophets is this same image of the wings, and in the

care.</p>

warning them by the past; for of the future day
of His second coming doth He here speak.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p47">What then? Did they not see Him from that time? But it
is not that hour which He meaneth in saying, Henceforth, but the time
up to His crucifixion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p48">For since they were forever accusing Him of this, that
He was a kind of rival God, and a foe to God, He moves them to love Him
by this, namely, by showing Himself to be of one accord with His
Father; and He indicates Himself to be the same that was in the
prophets. Wherefore also He uses the same words as did the
prophets.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p49">And by these He intimated both His resurrection, and His
second coming, and made it plain even to the utterly unbelieving, that
then most surely they should worship Him. And how did He make this
plain? By speaking of many things that were first to be, that He should
send prophets, that they should kill them; that it should be in the
synagogues; that they should suffer the utmost extremities; that their
house should be left desolate; that they should undergo things more
grievous than any, and such as never were undergone before. For all
these things are enough to furnish even to the most senseless and
contentious a clear proof of that which should come to pass at His
coming.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p50">For I will ask them, Did He send the prophets and wise
men? Did they slay them in their synagogue? Was their house left
desolate? Did all the vengeance come upon that generation? It is quite
plain that it was so, and no man gainsays it. As then all these things
came to pass, so shall those also come to pass, and most surely they
shall submit then.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p51">But they shall derive thence no advantage in the way of
defense, as neither will they who repent of their course of life
then.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p52">Wherefore let us, while it is time, practise what is
good. For like as they henceforth derived no advantage from their
knowledge, even so neither shall we ourselves from our repentance for
our wickedness. For neither to the pilot, when the bark is sunk in the
sea from his remissness, will there remain anything more; nor to the
physician, when the sick man is gone; but each of these must before the
end devise, and execute all things, so as to be involved in no danger,
nor shame; but after this, all is unprofitable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p53">Let us also then, while in sickness, send for
physicians, and lay out money, and exert unceasing diligence, that
having risen up from our affliction, we may depart hence in health.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p54">And as much care as we exert about our servants, when
their bodies are sick, so much let us show forth upon ourselves, when
our soul is diseased. And indeed we are nearer to ourselves than our
servants, and our souls are more necessary than those bodies, but
nevertheless it were well if we exert at least an equal diligence. For
if we do not this now, when gone, thenceforth we may obtain nothing
more in the way of plea.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p55">4. Who is so wretched, one may say, as not to show even
as much thought as this? Why this is the marvellous thing, that we are
held in so little esteem with our ownselves, that we despise ourselves
more than our servants. For when our servants are sick of a fever, we
send for physicians, and make a separation in the house, and compel
them to obey the laws of that art; and if these are neglected, we are
displeased with them, and set persons to watch them, who will not, even
should they wish them, suffer them to satiate their desire; and if they
who have the care of these persons should say, that medicines must be
procured at great cost, we yield; and whatsoever they may enjoin, we
obey, and we pay them hire for these injunctions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p56">But when we are sick (or rather there is no time when we
are not sick), we do not so much as call in the physician, we do not
lay out money, but as though some ruffian,<note n="2720" id="iii.LXXI-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p57">Lit., “executioner.”</p></note>and enemy, and foes were concerned, so do we disregard our soul. And
these things I say, not finding fault with our attention towards our
servants, but thinking it meet to take at least as much care of our
souls. And how should we do? one may say. Show it to Paul when ill;
call in Matthew; let John sit by it. Hear from them, what we ought to
do that is thus ill, they will surely tell, and will not conceal. For
they are not dead, but live and speak. But doth the soul take no heed
to them, being weighed down by the fever? Do thou compel it, and awaken
its reasoning power. Call in the prophets. There is no need to pay
money to these physicians, for neither do they themselves demand hire
for themselves, nor for the medicines which they prepare do they drive
thee to the necessity of expense, except for almsgiving; but in
everything else they even add to thy possessions; as, for instance,
when they require thee to be temperate, they deliver thee from
unseasonable and wrong expenses; when they tell thee to abstain from
drunkenness, they make thee wealthier. Seest thou the skill of
physicians, who besides health, are supplying thee also with riches?
Sit down therefore by

<pb n="431" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_431.html" id="iii.LXXI-Page_431" />

them, and
learn of them the nature of thy disease. For instance, dost thou love
wealth, and greedy gain, like as the fevered love water? Listen at any
rate to their admonitions. For like as the physician saith to thee, If
thou wilt gratify thy desire, thou wilt perish, and undergo this or
that; even so also Paul: “They that will be rich, fall into
temptation, and a snare of the devil, and into foolish and hurtful
lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.”<note n="2721" id="iii.LXXI-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p58"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 9" id="iii.LXXI-p58.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.9">1 Tim. vi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p65">And like as the physician saith, that what is cold is
hurtful to teeth, to nerves, to bones; so he too, more briefly indeed,
as heedful of brevity, yet far more, clearly and more powerfully,
saith, “For the love of money is the root of all
evils.”<note n="2726" id="iii.LXXI-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p66"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. vi. 10" id="iii.LXXI-p66.1" parsed="|1Tim|6|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.10">1 Tim. vi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p67">Of what then should one make use? He tells this also: of

to cast away all superfluous things, he tells also him that is thus
diseased, how he ought to handle these things too. “That they

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p70">Seest thou what manner of things he enjoins? Wilt thou
call in also another physician besides? To me at least it seems well.
For neither are these physicians like those of the body, who often,
while vying one with another, overwhelm the sick man. But not so these,
for they have regard to the health of the sick, not to their own
vainglory. Be not then afraid of the number of them; one Master speaks
in all, that is, Christ.</p>

For neither was it wealth that He took away, but to be slave of riches,
and a lover of greedy gain.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p81">How then is it possible for the rich man to be saved. By
possessing his goods in common with them that are in need, being such
as Job was, and exterminating out of his soul the desire of more, and
in no points going beyond real need.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p82">He shows thee together with these this selfsame publican
also, that was grievously oppressed by the fever of covetousness,
quickly set free from it. For what more sordid than a publican?
Nevertheless, the man became indifferent to wealth from obeying the
laws of the physician. For indeed He hath for His disciples such
persons as these, that were sick of the same diseases as we are, and
have recovered their health quickly. And He shows us each, in order we
may not despair. See at least this publican. Mark again another, a
chief of the publicans, who promised four fold indeed for all that he
had extorted, and

the half of all
that he possessed, that he might receive Jesus.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p83">But art thou on fire with exceeding desire for riches.
Have the possessions of all men instead of thine own. For indeed I give
thee, He saith, more than thou seekest, in opening to thee the houses
of the wealthy throughout the world. “For whosoever hath forsaken
father or mother, or lands, or house, shall receive an
hundredfold.”<note n="2736" id="iii.LXXI-p83.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXI-p84"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 29" id="iii.LXXI-p84.1" parsed="|Matt|19|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.29">Matt. xix.

even remove this grievous thirst altogether, and wilt endure all things
easily, so far from desiring more, not seeking often even necessary
things. Thus doth Paul suffer hunger, and is held in honor more than
when he ate. Forasmuch as a wrestler also, when striving, and winning
crowns, would not choose to give up and to be in repose; and a merchant
who hath entered on sea voyages would not desire to be afterwards in
idleness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p85">And we therefore, if we should taste as we ought of
spiritual fruits, shall thenceforth not even account the things present
to be anything, being seized by the desire of the things to come as
with some most noble intoxication.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXI-p86">Let us taste of them, therefore, that we may both be
delivered from the turmoil of the things present, and may attain the
good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the might, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.</p>

temple. And He answered and said unto them, See ye not all these
things? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone
upon another, that shall not be thrown down.”</i></p>
 
<p class="c12" id="iii.LXXII-p5"><span class="c11" id="iii.LXXII-p5.1">For</span> inasmuch as He said,
“Your house is left desolate,” and had previously
forewarned them of many grievous things; therefore the disciples having
heard these things, as though marvelling at it, came unto Him, showing
the beauty of the temple, and wondering, if so much beauty was to be
destroyed, and materials so costly, and variety of workmanship past
utterance; He no longer thenceforth talks to them of desolation merely,
but foretells an entire destruction. “See ye not all these
things,” saith He, and do ye marvel, and are ye amazed?
“There shall not remain one stone upon another.” How then
did it remain? one may say. But what is this? For neither so hath the
prediction fallen to the ground. For He said these things either
indicating its entire desolation, or at that spot where He was. For
there are parts of it destroyed unto the foundations.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p6">And together with its we would say another thing also,
that from what hath been done, even the most contentious ought to
believe concerning the remains, that they are utterly to be
destroyed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p7">“And as He sat upon the mount of Olives, the
disciples came unto Him privately, saying, Tell us when shall these
things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p9">Therefore did they come unto Him privately, as it was of
such matters they meant to inquire. For they were in travail to know
the day of His coming, because of their eager desire to behold that
glory, which is the cause of countless blessings. And these two things
do they ask him, when shall these things be? that is, the overthrow of
the temple; and, what is the sign of thy coming? But Luke saith,<note n="2739" id="iii.LXXII-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p10"><scripRef passage="Luke xxi. 6, 7" id="iii.LXXII-p10.1" parsed="|Luke|21|6|21|7" osisRef="Bible:Luke.21.6-Luke.21.7">Luke xxi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p15">For since they felt as being told of vengeance falling
on others when hearing of that which was to be brought upon Jerusalem
and as though they were to be out of the turmoils, and were dreaming of
good things only, and looked for these to befall them quite
immediately; for this cause He again foretells to them grievous things,
making them earnest, and commanding them on two grounds to watch, so as
neither to be seduced by the deceit of them that would beguile them,
nor to be overpowered by the violence of ills that should overtake
them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p16">For the war, saith He, shall be twofold that of the
deceivers, and that of the enemies, but the former far more grievous,
as coming upon them in the confusion and turmoils, and when men were
terrified and troubled. For indeed great was the storm then, when the
Roman power was beginning to flourish, and cities were taken, and camps
and weapons were set in motion, and many were readily believed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p17">But of wars in Jerusalem is He speaking; for it is not
surely of those without, and everywhere in the world; for what did they
care for these? And besides, He would thus say nothing new, if He were
speaking of the calamities of the world at large, which are happening
always. For before this, were wars, and tumults, and fightings; but He
speaks of the Jewish wars coming upon them at no great distance, for
henceforth the Roman arms were a matter of anxiety. Since then these
things also were sufficient to confound them, He foretells them
all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p18">Then to show that He Himself also will assail the Jews
with them, and war on them, He speaks not of battles only, but also of
plagues sent from God, famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,
showing that the wars also He Himself permitted to come upon them, and
that these things do not happen for no purpose according to what has
been before the accustomed course of things amongst men, but proceed
from the wrath on high.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p19">Therefore He saith, they shall come not by themselves or
at once, but with signs. For that the Jews may not say, that they who
then believed were the authors of these evils, therefore hath He told
them also of the cause of their coming upon them. “For verily I
say unto you,” He said before, “all these things shall come
upon this generation,” having made mention of the stain of blood
on them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p20">Then lest on hearing of the showers of evils, they
should suppose the gospel to be broken through, He added,
“See,<note n="2743" id="iii.LXXII-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p21">[The Oxford translator renders “Take
heed,” but <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXII-p21.1">ὀρτε</span> is rendered “See” above; so
A.V. and R.V.—R.]</p></note>be not troubled, for all things must come to pass,” <i>i.e.</i>
which I foretold, and the approach of the temptations will set aside
none of the things which I have said; but there shall indeed be tumults
and confusion, but nothing shall shake my predictions.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p22">Then since He had said to the Jews, “Ye shall not
see me, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord;” and the disciples supposed that together with the
destruction would be the end also; to set right this secret thought of
theirs, He said, “But the end is not yet.” For that they
did suspect even as I said, you may learn from their question. For,
what did they ask? When shall these things be? <i>i.e</i>. when shall
Jerusalem be destroyed? And what is the sign of Thy coming, and of the
end of the world?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p23">But He answered nothing directly to this question, but
first speaks of those other things that are urgent, and which it was
needful for them to learn first. For neither concerning Jerusalem
straightway, nor of His own second coming, did He speak, but touching
the ills that were to meet them at the doors. Wherefore also He makes
them earnest in their exertions, by saying, “Take heed that no
man deceive you;<note n="2744" id="iii.LXXII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p24">[R.V., “lead you astray.”]</p></note>for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p25">Afterwards, when He hath roused them to listen about
these things (for, “take heed,” saith He, “that no
man deceive you”);<note n="2745" id="iii.LXXII-p25.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p26">[R.V., “lead you astray.”]</p></note>and having made them energetic, and prepared them to be watchful, and
hath spoken first of the false Christs, then He speaks of the ills of
Jerusalem, assuring them ever by the things already past, foolish and
contentious though they were, of those which were yet to come.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p27">2. But by “wars and rumors of wars,” He
meaneth, what I before said, the troubles coming upon them. After this,
because, as I have already said, they supposed after that war the end
would come, see how He warns them, saying, “But the end is not
yet. For nation,” He saith, “shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom.”<note n="2746" id="iii.LXXII-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 7" id="iii.LXXII-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|24|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.7">Matt. xxiv.

sake. Then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and
many false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall deceive
many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p37">After this again, what is more grievous than all, they
shall not have so much as the consolation from love. Then indicating,
that these things will in no degree harm the noble and the firm, He
saith, Fear not, neither be troubled. For if ye show forth the patience
that becomes you, the dangers will not prevail over you. And it is a
plain proof of this, that the word shall surely be preached everywhere
in the world, so much shall ye be above the things that alarm you. For,
that they may not say, how then shall we live? He said more, Ye shall
both live and preach everywhere. Therefore He added moreover,
“And this gospel shall be preached in the whole world for a
witness to all nations, and then shall the end come,”<note n="2753" id="iii.LXXII-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 14" id="iii.LXXII-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|24|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.14">Matt. xxiv.

so large a portion, consider what the rest also wrought. For writing to
others also, Paul again saith concerning the gospel, that “it is
bringing forth fruit, and growing up in every creature which is under
Heaven.”<note n="2756" id="iii.LXXII-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p42"><scripRef passage="Col. 1.6,23" id="iii.LXXII-p42.1" parsed="|Col|1|6|0|0;|Col|1|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.6 Bible:Col.1.23">Col. i. 6. [Combined with Col. i. 23.</scripRef>]</p></note>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p43">But what meaneth, “For a witness to all
nations?” Forasmuch as though it was everywhere preached, yet it
was not everywhere believed. It was for a witness, He saith, to them
that were disbelieving, that is, for conviction, for accusation, for a
testimony; for they that believed will bear witness against them that
believed not, and will condemn them. And for this cause, after the
gospel is preached in every part of the world, Jerusalem is destroyed,
that they may not have so much as a shadow of an excuse for their
perverseness. For they that saw His power shine throughout every place,
and in an instant take the world captive, what excuse could they then
have for continuing in the same perverseness? For in proof that it was
everywhere preached at that time, hear what Paul saith, “of the
gospel which was preached to every creature which is under
Heaven.”<note n="2757" id="iii.LXXII-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p44"><scripRef passage="Col. i. 23" id="iii.LXXII-p44.1" parsed="|Col|1|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Col.1.23">Col. i.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p45">Which also is a very great sign of Christ’s power,
that in twenty or at most thirty years the word had reached the ends of
the world. “After this therefore,” saith He, “shall
come the end of Jerusalem.” For that He intimates this was
manifested by what follows.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p46">For He brought in also a prophecy, to confirm their
desolation, saying, “But when ye shall see the abomination of
desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy
place, let him that readeth understand.”<note n="2758" id="iii.LXXII-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p47"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 15" id="iii.LXXII-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|24|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.15">Matt. xxiv.

the statue of him who then took the city, which he who desolated the
city and the temple placed within the temple, wherefore Christ calleth
it, “of desolation.” Moreover, in order that they might
learn that these things will be while some of them are alive, therefore
He said, “When ye see the abomination of desolation.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p48">3. Whence one may most marvel at Christ’s power,
and their courage, for that they preached in such times, in which most

fellow-sailors were at strife above, and
monsters were rising up from beneath, and with the waves devouring the
mariners, and thunderbolts falling, and their being pirates, and those
in the vessel plotting one against another), were to command men
inexperienced in sailing, and who had not so much as seen the sea to
sit at the rudder, and to guide and fight the vessel, and when an
immense fleet was coming against them with a great array, making use of
a single bark, with her crew in this disturbed state, to sink and
subdue the fleet. For indeed by the heathens they were hated as Jews,
and by the Jews were stoned, as waging war against their laws; and
nowhere could they stand.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p50">Thus were all things, precipices, and reefs, and rocks,
the things in the cities, the things in the fields, the things in the
houses, and every single person was at war with them; generals and
rulers, and private persons, and all nations, and all people, and a
turmoil which cannot be set forth by words. For the Jewish race was
exceedingly detestable to the government of the Romans, as having
occasioned them endless trouble; and not even from this did the
preaching of the word take hurt; but the city was stormed and set on
fire, and involved its inhabitants in countless evils; but the apostles
that came from thence, introducing new laws, prevailed even over the
Romans.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p51">O strange and wonderful facts! Countless myriads of Jews
did the Romans then subdue, and they did not prevail over twelve men
fighting against them naked and unarmed. What language can set forth
this miracle? For they that teach need to have these two things, to be
worthy of credit, and to be beloved by them whom they are instructing;
and together with these, and besides them, that their sayings should be
easy of reception, and the time should be free from trouble and
tumults.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p52">But then were all the contraries to these. For while
they did not seem worthy of credit, they were withdrawing from such as
did seem worthy of it, those who had been deceived by them. So far from
being loved, they were even hated, and were taking men away from what
they loved, both habits, and hereditary customs, and laws.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p53">Again, their injunctions had great difficulty; but the
things, from which they were withdrawing men, much pleasure. And many
were the perils, many the deaths, both themselves and they that obeyed
them underwent, and together with all this, the time also occasioned
them much difficulty, teeming with wars, tumults, disturbance, so that,
even if there had been none of the things we have mentioned, it would
have quite thrown all things into confusion.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p54">We have good occasion to say, “Who shall tell the
mighty works of the Lord, and make all His praises to be
heard.”<note n="2760" id="iii.LXXII-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p55"><scripRef passage="Ps. cvi. 2" id="iii.LXXII-p55.1" parsed="|Ps|6|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.6.2">Ps. cvi.
2</scripRef>.</p></note> For if his own people amid signs hearkened not to Moses, because of the
clay only, and the bricks; who persuaded these that every day were
beaten and slain, and were suffering incurable evils, to leave a quiet
life, and to prefer thereto this which was teeming with blood and
death, and that when they who preached it were strangers to them, and
very hostile in every way? For I say not unto nations and cities and
people, but into a small house let one bring in him that is hated of
all that are in the house, and by him endeavor to bring them away from
those whom they love, from father, and wife, and child, will he not
surely be seen torn in pieces, before he hath opened his mouth? And if
there be added moreover a tumult and strife of husband and wife in the
house, will they not stone him to death before he steps on the
threshold? And if he also be one whom they may readily despise, and who
enjoins galling things, and commands them who are living in luxury to
practise self restraint, and together with this the conflict be against
those who are far more in numbers and who excel him, is it not quite
manifest that he will be utterly destroyed? Yet nevertheless, this,
which is impossible to be done in one house, this hath Christ
accomplished in all the world, through precipices and furnaces, and
ravines, and rocks, and land and sea at war with Him, bringing in the
healers of the world.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p56">And if thou art minded to learn these things more
distinctly, I mean, the famines, the pestilences, the earthquakes, the
other calamities, peruse the history about these things composed by
Josephus, and thou wilt know all accurately. Therefore Himself too
said, “Be not troubled, for all must be;” and, “He
that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved;” and,
“The gospel shall surely be preached in all the world.” For
when weakened and faint at the fear of what had been said, He braces
them up by saying, Though ten thousand things be done, the gospel must
be preached in every part of the world, and then shall the end
come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p57">4. Seest thou in what a state things were then, and how
manifold was the war? And this is the beginning, when each of the
things to be effected most required quiet. In what state then were
they? for nothing hinders us

from
resuming the same things again. The first war was that of the
deceivers; “For there shall come,” He saith, “false
Christs and false prophets:” the second, that of the Romans,
“For ye shall hear,” He saith, “of wars:” the
third, that which bringeth on the “famines:” the fourth,
“the pestilences” and “the earthquakes:” the
fifth, “they shall deliver you into afflictions:” the
sixth, “ye shall be hated of all men:” the seventh,
“They shall betray one another, and hate one another” (an
intestine war doth He here make known); then, “false
Christs,” and false brethren; then, “the love of the

Field rejects it. If accepted, it should be rendered “of the
many,” as in the R.V. But internal reasons are against it. It
would naturally be supplied from the New Testament passage. Moreover,
the briefer reading yields a better sense: “Love shall wax cold,
the cause of all these ills.”—R.]</p></note>shall wax cold,” which is the cause of all the ills.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p59">Seest thou numberless kinds of war, new and strange? Yet
nevertheless in the midst of these things, and much more (for with the
intestine wars was mingled also that of kinsmen), the gospel prevailed
over the whole earth. “For the gospel,” He saith,
“shall be preached in the whole world.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p60">Where then are they who set up the power of a nativity
and the cycle of times against the doctrines of the church? For who has
ever recorded that another Christ appeared; that such a thing took
place? Although they falsely affirm other things, that ten myriads of
years passed, yet this they cannot even feign. Of what kind of cycle
then would ye speak? For there was never another Sodom, nor another
Gomorrah, nor another flood. How long do ye trifle, talking of a cycle
and nativity?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p61">How then, it is said, do many of the things they say
come to pass? Because thou hast bereaved thyself of the help God
bestows, and didst betray thyself, and didst place thyself without His
providence; therefore doth the evil spirit turn and twist about thy
matters as he will.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p62">But not so among the saints, or rather not even amongst
us sinners, who utterly despise it. For although our practice is beyond
endurance, yet because by God’s grace we cling with much
exactness to the doctrines of the truth, we are above the malice of the
evil spirits.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p63">And altogether, what is a nativity? nothing else than
injustice, and confusion, and that all things are borne along at
random; or rather not at random only; but more than this, with
folly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p64">“And if there is not any nativity, whence is such
a one rich? whence is such a one poor?”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p65">I know not: for in this way I will for a time reason
with thee, instructing thee not to be curious about all things; neither
in consequence of this to go on at random and rashly. For neither
because thou art ignorant of this, oughtest thou to feign the things
that are not. It is better to be ignorant well, than to learn ill. For
he that knoweth not the cause, will come soon to the right one; but he
who because he does not know the real cause, feigns one that is untrue,
will not be able easily to receive the real; but he needs more both of
labors and toil, in order to take away the former. For indeed on a
tablet, if it have been wiped smooth, any one may easily write what he
will, but when it is written upon, no longer in the same way, for we
must first wipe out what has been ill written. And amongst physicians
again, he that applies nothing, is far better than he that applies
hurtful things; and he who builds unsoundly, is worse than he who doth
not so much as build at all; like as the land is far better that bears
nothing, than that which bears thorns.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p66">Let us not then be impatient to learn all things, but
let us endure to be even ignorant of some things, that when we have
found a teacher, we may not afford him double toil. Or rather many
oftentimes have remained even incurably diseased, by carelessly
entangling themselves in evil opinions. For neither is the toil the
same to pluck up first what hath taken root amiss, and then to sow, as
to plant a clear ground. For in that case, he must overthrow first, and
then put in other things; but in this, the hearing is ready.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p67">Whence then is such a one rich? I will say, now; many
acquire wealth, by God’s gift; and many by His permission. For
this is the short and simple account.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p68">What then? it is said, doth He make the whoremongers to
be rich, and the adulterers, and him that hath abused himself with
mankind, and him that hath made a bad use of his possessions? He doth
not make them, but permits them to be rich; and great is the
difference, and quite infinite between making and permitting. But
wherefore doth He suffer it at all? Because it is not yet the time for
judgment, that every one may receive according to his merits.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p69">For what more worthless than that rich man, who giveth
not to Lazarus so much as of his crumbs? Nevertheless, he was more
wretched than all, for he came to be possessed not even of a drop of
water, and for this very cause most especially, that being rich he was
cruel. For if there are two

<pb n="437" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_437.html" id="iii.LXXII-Page_437" />

wicked
men, who have not had the same portion here, but one in wealth, the
other in poverty, they will not be similarly punished there, but the
wealthier more grievously.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p70">5. Dost thou not see at least even this man, suffering
more fearfully because he had “received his good things?”
Do thou also therefore, when thou seest in prosperity one who is become
rich by injustice, groan, weep; for indeed this wealth is to him an
addition of punishment. For like as they who sin much, and are not
minded to repent, treasure up to themselves a treasure of wrath; even
so they, who, besides not being punished, are even enjoying prosperity,
will undergo the greater punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p71">And the proof of this, if thou wilt, I will show thee,
not from the things to come only, but also from the present life. For
the blessed David, when he sinned that sin of Bathsheba, and was
convicted by the prophet, for this cause most of all was he more
severely reproved, that even when he had enjoyed such security, he was
like this. Hear at least God upbraiding him with this especially.
“Did not I anoint thee for a king, and delivered thee from the
hand of Saul, and give thee all that pertained to thy master, and all
the house of Israel and Judah, and if it had been little for thee, I
would have added thus and thus; and wherefore hast thou done that which
was evil in my sight?”<note n="2762" id="iii.LXXII-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p72"><scripRef passage="2 Sam. xii. 7-9" id="iii.LXXII-p72.1" parsed="|2Sam|12|7|12|9" osisRef="Bible:2Sam.12.7-2Sam.12.9">2 Sam. xii.

diverse, according to the times, according to the persons, according to
their rank, according to their understanding, according to other things
besides. And that what I say may be more clear, let one sin be set
forth, fornication; and mark how many different punishments I find not
from myself, but from the divine Scriptures. Did any one commit
fornication before the law, he is differently punished; and this Paul
showeth, “For as many as have sinned without law, shall also
perish without law.”<note n="2763" id="iii.LXXII-p72.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p73"><scripRef passage="Rom. ii. 12" id="iii.LXXII-p73.1" parsed="|Rom|2|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.2.12">Rom. ii.

grievous things. “For as many as have sinned in the law shall be

occur, either here or in the text of the New Testament. R.V.,

dignity a very great addition to his punishment. So for this cause,
whereas the other women were slain for fornication, the daughters of
the priests were burnt; the lawgiver showing the more amply, how great
punishment await the priest if he commits this sin. For if on the
daughter he inflicts a greater punishment, because of her being a
priest’s daughter, much more on the man himself who bears the
priest’s office. Was fornication committed with any violence? she
is even freed from punishment. Did one play the harlot being rich, and
another being poor? Here again also is a difference. And this is
evident from what we have said before concerning David. Was any one
guilty of fornication after Christ’s coming? Should he depart
uninitiated, he will suffer a punishment more sore than all those. Was
any guilty of fornication after the laver? in this case not even a
consolation is left for the sin any more. And this selfsame thing Paul
declared when he said, “He that despised Moses’ law dieth
without mercy, under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer
punishment suppose ye shall he be counted worthy, who hath trodden
underfoot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant an
unholy thing, and hath done despite to the grace of the Spirit?<note n="2765" id="iii.LXXII-p74.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXII-p75"><scripRef passage="Heb. x. 28, 29" id="iii.LXXII-p75.1" parsed="|Heb|10|28|10|29" osisRef="Bible:Heb.10.28-Heb.10.29">Heb. x. 28,

now? this above all is the crown of the evil deeds.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXII-p76">Seest thou of one sin how many different forms? one that
before the law, another that after the law, another that of him who
bears the priest’s office; that of the rich woman, and that of
the poor woman, of her that is a catechumen, and of the believing
woman, of the daughter of the priest.</p>

were to overtake the city, and of the trials of the apostles, and that

without end, and that it must needs be that he that was involved

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p12">Seest thou that His discourse is addressed to the Jews,
and that He is speaking of the ills that should overtake them? For the
apostles surely were not to keep the Sabbath day, neither to be there,
when Vespasian did those things. For indeed the most part of them were
already departed this life. And if any was left, he was dwelling then
in other parts of the world.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p13">But wherefore neither “in the winter, nor on the
Sabbath day?”<note n="2780" id="iii.LXXIII-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p14">[There is a curious variation in the Greek text
here.

σαββτ</span>, but here <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXIII-p14.7">σαββτου</span>, without any
preposition.—R.]</p></note> Not in the winter, because of the difficulty arising from the season;
not on the Sabbath day, because of the absolute authority exercised by
the law. For since they had need of flight, and of the swiftest flight,
but neither would the Jews dare to flee on the Sabbath day, because of
the law, neither in winter was such a thing easy; therefore,
“Pray ye,” saith He; “for then shall be tribulation,
such as never was, neither shall be.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p15">And let not any man suppose this to have been spoken
hyperbolically; but let him study the writings of Josephus, and learn
the truth of the sayings. For neither can any one say, that the man
being a believer, in order to establish Christ’s words, hath
exaggerated the tragical history. For indeed He was both a Jew, and a
determined Jew, and very zealous, and among them that lived after
Christ’s coming.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p16">What then saith this man? That those terrors surpassed
all tragedy, and that no such had ever overtaken the nation. For so
great was the famine, that the very mothers fought about the devouring
of their children, and that there were wars about this; and he saith
that many when they were dead had their bellies ripped up.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p17">I should therefore be glad to inquire of the Jews.
Whence came there thus upon them wrath from God intolerable, and more
sore than all that had befallen aforetime, not in Judæa only, but
in any part of the world? Is it not quite clear, that it was for the
deed of the cross, and for this rejection? All would say it, and with
all and before all the truth of the facts itself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p18">But mark, I pray thee, the exceeding greatness of the
ills, when not only compared with the time before, they appear more
grievous, but also with all the time to come. For not in all the world,
neither in all time that is past, and that is to come, shall any one be
able to say such ills have been. And very naturally; for neither had
any man perpetrated, not of those that ever have been, nor of those to
come hereafter, a deed so wicked and horrible. Therefore He saith,
“there shall be tribulation such as never was, nor shall
be.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p19">“And except those days should be shortened, there
should no flesh be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days
shall be shortened.”<note n="2781" id="iii.LXXIII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 22" id="iii.LXXIII-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|24|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.22">Matt. xxiv.
22</scripRef>. [R.V., “And except
those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved:
but,” etc.]</p></note> By these things He shows them to be deserving of a more grievous
punishment than had been mentioned, speaking now of the days of the war
and of that siege. But what He saith is like this. If, saith He, the
war of the Romans against the city had prevailed further, all the Jews
had perished (for by “no flesh” here, He meaneth no Jewish
flesh), both those abroad, and those at home. For not only against
those in Judæa did they war, but also those that were dispersed
everywhere they outlawed and banished, because of their hatred against
the former.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p21">2. But whom doth He here mean by the elect? The
believers that were shut up in the midst of them. For that Jews may not
say that because of the gospel, and the worship of Christ, these ills
took place, He showeth, that so far from the believers being the cause,
if it had not been for them, all had perished utterly. For if God had
permitted the war to be protracted, not so much as a remnant of the
Jews had remained, but lest those of them who had become believers
should perish together with the unbelieving Jews, He quickly put down
the fighting, and gave an end to the war. Therefore He saith,
“But for the elect’s sake they shall be shortened.”
But these things He said to leave an encouragement to those of them who
were

<pb n="440" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_440.html" id="iii.LXXIII-Page_440" />

shut up in the midst of them,
and to allow them to take breath, that they might not be in fear, as
though they were to perish with them. And if here so great is His care
for them, that for their sakes others also are saved, and that for the
sake of Christians remnants were left of the Jews, how great will be
their honor in the time for their crowns?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p22">By this He also encouraged them not to be distressed at
their own dangers, since these others are suffering such things, and
for no profit, but for evil upon their own head.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p23">But He not only encouraged them, but also led them off
secretly and unsuspectedly from the customs of the Jews. For if there
is not to be a change afterwards, and the temple is not to stand, it is
quite evident that the law also shall be made to cease.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p24">However, He spake not this openly, but by their entire
destruction He darkly intimated it. But He spake it not openly, lest He
should startle them before the time. Wherefore neither at the beginning
did He of Himself fall into discourse touching these things; but having
first lamented over the city, He constrained them to show Him the
stones, and question Him, in order that as it were in answering them
their question, He might declare to them beforehand all the things to
come.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p25">But mark thou, I pray thee, the dispensation of the
Spirit, that John wrote none of these things, lest he should seem to
write from the very history of the things done (for indeed he lived a
long time after the taking of the city), but they, who died before the
taking, and had seen none of these things, they write it, in order that
every way the power of the prediction should clearly shine forth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p26">“Then, if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is
Christ, or there; believe it not: for there shall arise false Christs,
and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, so as to deceive,
if possible, the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.<note n="2782" id="iii.LXXIII-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p27">[R.V., “to lead astray, if possible, even the

not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers, believe it not. For as
the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west,
so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be. For wheresoever the
carcase is, there shall the eagles be gathered together.”<note n="2783" id="iii.LXXIII-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p28"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 23-28" id="iii.LXXIII-p28.1" parsed="|Matt|24|23|24|28" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.23-Matt.24.28">Matt. xxiv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p29">Having finished what concerned Jerusalem, He passes on
to His own coming, and tells the signs of it, not for their use only,
but for us also, and for all that shall come after us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p30">“Then.” When? Here, as I have often said,
the word, “then,” relates not to the connection in order of
time with the things before mentioned. At least, when He was minded to
express the connection of time, He added, “Immediately after the
tribulation of those days,”<note n="2784" id="iii.LXXIII-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 29" id="iii.LXXIII-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|24|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.29">Matt. xxiv.
29</scripRef>.</p></note>but here not so, but, “then,” not meaning what should
follow straightway after these things, but what should be in the time,
when these things were to be done, of which He was about to speak. So
also when it is said, “In those days cometh John the
Baptist,”<note n="2785" id="iii.LXXIII-p31.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p32"><scripRef passage="Matt. iii. 1" id="iii.LXXIII-p32.1" parsed="|Matt|3|1|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.1">Matt. iii.
1</scripRef>. See the comment on that
place.</p></note>he is not speaking of the time that should straightway follow, but that
many years after, and that in which these things were done, of which He
was about to speak. For, in fact, having spoken of the birth of Jesus,
and of the coming of the magi, and of the death of Herod, He at once
saith, “In those days cometh John the Baptist;” although
thirty years had intervened. But this is customary in the Scripture, I
mean, to use this manner of narration. So then here also, having passed
over all the intermediate time from the taking of Jerusalem unto the
preludes of the consummation, He speaketh of the time just before the
consummation. “Then,” He saith therefore, “if any man
shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, believe it
not.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p33">Awhile He secures them by the place, mentioning the
distinguishing marks of His second coming, and the indications of the
deceivers. For not, as when at His former coming He appeared in
Bethlehem, and in a small corner of the world, and no one knew Him at
the beginning, so doth He say it shall be then too; but openly and with
all circumstance, and so as not to need one to tell these things. And
this is no small sign that He will not come secretly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p34">But mark how here He saith nothing of war (for He is
interpreting the doctrine concerning His advent), but of them that
attempt to deceive. For some in the days of the apostles deceived the
multitude, “for they shall come,” saith He, “and
shall deceive many;”<note n="2786" id="iii.LXXIII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p35"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 11" id="iii.LXXIII-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|24|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.11">Matt. xxiv.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>and others shall do so before His second coming, who shall also be more
grievous than the former. “For they shall show,” He saith,
“signs and wonders, so as to deceive if possible the very
elect:”<note n="2787" id="iii.LXXIII-p35.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p36"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 24" id="iii.LXXIII-p36.1" parsed="|Matt|24|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.24">Matt. xxiv.

minister to him. Of him

<pb n="441" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_441.html" id="iii.LXXIII-Page_441" />

Paul too
speaks on this wise. Having called him “man of sin,” and
“son of perdition,” He added, “Whose coming is after
the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders; and
with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.”<note n="2788" id="iii.LXXIII-p36.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p37"><scripRef passage="2 Thess. ii. 9, 10" id="iii.LXXIII-p37.1" parsed="|2Thess|2|9|2|10" osisRef="Bible:2Thess.2.9-2Thess.2.10">2 Thess.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p38">And see how He secures them; “Go not forth into
the deserts, enter not into the secret chambers.” He did not say,
“Go, and do not believe;” but, “Go not forth, neither
depart thither.” For great then will be the deceiving, because
that even deceiving miracles are wrought.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p39">3. Having told them how Antichrist cometh, as, for
instance, that it will be in a place; He saith how Himself also cometh.
How then doth He Himself come? “As the lightning cometh out of
the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming of
the Son of Man be. For wheresoever the carcase is, there also will the
eagles be gathered together.”<note n="2789" id="iii.LXXIII-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p40"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 27, 28" id="iii.LXXIII-p40.1" parsed="|Matt|24|27|24|28" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.27-Matt.24.28">Matt. xxiv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p41">How then shineth the lightning? It needs not one to talk
of it, it needs not a herald, but even to them that sit in houses, and
to them in chambers it shows itself in an instant of time throughout
the whole world. So shall that coming be, showing itself at once
everywhere by reason of the shining forth of His glory. But He mentions
also another sign, “where the carcase is, there also shall the
eagles be;” meaning the multitude of the angels, of the martyrs,
of all the saints.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p42">Then He tells of fearful prodigies. What are these
prodigies? “Immediately after the tribulation of those
days,” saith He, “the sun shall be darkened.”<note n="2790" id="iii.LXXIII-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p43"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 29" id="iii.LXXIII-p43.1" parsed="|Matt|24|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.29">Matt. xxiv.
29</scripRef>.</p></note> Of the tribulation of what days doth He speak? Of those of Antichrist
and of the false prophets? For there shall be great tribulation, there
being so many deceivers. But it is not protracted to a length of time.
For if the Jewish war was shortened for the elect’s sake, much
more shall this temptation be limited for these same’s sake.
Therefore, He said not, “after the tribulation,” but <span class="c20" id="iii.LXXIII-p43.2">Immediately</span> “after the tribulation of those
days shall the sun be darkened,” for almost at the same time all
things come to pass. For the false prophets and false Christs shall
come and cause confusion, and immediately He Himself will be here.
Because no small turmoil is then to prevail over the world.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p44">But how doth He come? The very creation being then
transfigured, for “the sun shall be darkened,” not
destroyed, but overcome by the light of His presence; and the stars
shall fall, for what shall be the need of them thenceforth, there being
no night? and “the powers of Heaven shall be shaken,” and
in all likelihood, seeing so great a change come to pass. For if when
the stars were made, they trembled and marvelled (“for when the
stars were made, all angels,” it is said, “praised Me with
a loud voice”);<note n="2791" id="iii.LXXIII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p45"><scripRef passage="Job xxxviii. 7" id="iii.LXXIII-p45.1" parsed="|Job|38|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Job.38.7">Job

servants giving account, and the whole world standing by that awful
judgment-seat, and those who have lived from Adam unto His coming,
having an account demanded of them of all that they did, how shall they
but tremble, and be shaken?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p46">“Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in
Heaven;”<note n="2792" id="iii.LXXIII-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p47"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 30" id="iii.LXXIII-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|24|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.30">Matt. xxiv.

darkened, and hide himself, and that will appear when it would not
appear, unless it were far brighter than the beams of the sun. But
wherefore doth the sign appear? In order that the shamelessness of the
Jews may be more abundantly silenced. For having the cross as the
greatest plea, Christ thus cometh to that judgment-seat, showing not
His wounds only, but also the death of reproach. “Then shall the
tribes mourn,” for there shall be no need of an accusation, when
they see the cross; and they shall mourn, that by His death they are
nothing benefited; because they crucified Him whom they ought to have
adored.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p48">Seest thou how fearfully He has pictured His coming? how
He has stirred up the spirits of His disciples? For this reason, let me
add, He puts the mournful things first, and then the good things, that
in this way also He may comfort and refresh them. And of His passion He
suggests to them the remembrance, and of His resurrection, and with a
display of glory,<note n="2793" id="iii.LXXIII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p49"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXIII-p49.1">μετ

whereas indeed He cometh then setting it forth for His sign. And
another saith, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”
Therefore it is that they shall mourn, when they see that this is
He.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p50">And forasmuch as He had made mention of the cross, He
added, “They shall see the Son of Man coming,” no longer on
the cross, but “in the clouds of Heaven, with power and great
glory.”<note n="2794" id="iii.LXXIII-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 30" id="iii.LXXIII-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|24|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.30">Matt. xxiv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p52">For think not, He meaneth, because thou hearest of the
cross, that it is again anything

<pb n="442" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_442.html" id="iii.LXXIII-Page_442" />

mournful, for He shall come with power and
great glory. But He bringeth it, that their sin may be self-condemned,
as if any one who had been struck by a stone, were to show the stone
itself, or his garments stained with blood. And He cometh in a cloud as
He was taken up, and the tribes seeing these things mourn. Not however
that the terrors shall with them proceed no further than mournings; but
the mourning shall be, that they may bring forth their sentence from
within, and condemn themselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p53">And then again, “He will send His angels with a
great trumpet,<note n="2795" id="iii.LXXIII-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p54">[So Tischendorf, and R.V. margin.—R.]</p></note>and they shall gather the elect from the four winds, from one end of

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p56">But when thou hast heard of this, consider the
punishment of them that remain. For neither shall they suffer that
former penalty only, but this too. And as above He said, that they
should say, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord,”<note n="2797" id="iii.LXXIII-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p57"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 39" id="iii.LXXIII-p57.1" parsed="|Matt|22|39|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.39">Matt. xxii.
39</scripRef>.</p></note>so here, that they shall mourn. For since He had spoken unto them of
grievous wars, that they might learn, that together with the fearful
things here, the torments there also await them, He brings them in
mourning and separated from the elect, and consigned to hell; by this
again rousing the disciples, and indicating from how many evils they
should be delivered, and how many good things they shall enjoy.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p58">4. And why now doth He call them by angels, if He comes
thus openly? To honor them in this way also. But Paul saith, that they
“shall be caught up in clouds.” And He said this also, when
He was speaking concerning a resurrection. “For<note n="2798" id="iii.LXXIII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p59"><scripRef passage="1 Thess. iv. 16" id="iii.LXXIII-p59.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|16|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.16">1 Thess.

with a shout, with the voice of an archangel.” So that when risen
again, the angels shall gather them together, when gathered together
the clouds shall catch them up; and all these things are done in a
moment, in an instant. For it is not that He abiding above calleth
them, but He Himself cometh with the sound of a trumpet. And what mean
the trumpets and the sound? They are for arousing, for gladness, to set
forth the amazing nature of the things then doing, for grief to them
that are left.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p60">Woe is me for that fearful day! For though we ought to
rejoice when we hear these things, we feel pain, and are dejected, and
our countenance is sad. Or is it I only that feel thus, and do ye
rejoice at hearing of these things? For upon me at least there comes a
kind of shudder when these things are said, and I lament bitterly, and
groan from the very depth of my heart. For I have no part in these
things, but in those that are spoken afterwards, that are said unto the
virgins, unto him that buried the talents he had received, unto the
wicked servant. For this cause I weep, to think from what glory we are
to be cast out, from what hope of blessings, and this perpetually, and
forever, to spare ourselves a little labor. For if indeed this were a
great toil, and a grievous law, we ought even so to do all things;
nevertheless many of the remiss would seem to have at least some
pretext, a poor pretext indeed, yet would they seem to have some, that
the toil was great, and the time endless, and the burden intolerable;
but now we can put forward no such objection; which circumstance most
of all will gnaw<note n="2799" id="iii.LXXIII-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p61"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXIII-p61.1">διατργειν</span>
.</p></note>us no less than hell at that time, when for want of a slight endeavor,
and a little toil, we shall have lost Heaven, and the unspeakable
blessings. For both the time is short, and the labor small, and yet we
faint and are supine. Thou strivest on earth, and the crown is in
Heaven; thou art punished of men, and art honored of God; the race is
for two days, and the reward for endless ages; the struggle is a
corruptible body, and the rewards in an incorruptible.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p62">And apart from these things, we should consider another
point also, that even if we do not choose to suffer any of the things
that are painful for Christ’s sake, we must in other ways most
assuredly endure them. For neither, though thou shouldest not have died
for Christ, wilt thou be immortal; neither though thou shouldest not
have cast away thy riches for Christ, wilt thou go away hence with
them. These things He requires of thee, which although He should not
require them, thou wilt have to give up, because thou art mortal; He
willeth thee to do these by thy choice, which thou must do by
necessity. So much only He requires to be added, that it be done for
His sake; since that these things befall men and pass away, cometh to
pass of natural necessity. Seest thou how easy the conflict? What it is
altogether necessary for thee to suffer, that choose to suffer for my
sake; let this only be added, and I have sufficient obedience. The gold
which thou intendest to lend to another, this lend to me, both at more
profit, and in greater security. Thy body, wherewith thou art going to
warfare for another, make it to war for me, for indeed I surpass thy
toils with recompenses in the most abundant excess. Yet thou in all
other matters preferrest him

<pb n="443" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_443.html" id="iii.LXXIII-Page_443" />

that
giveth thee more as well in loans, as in marketing and in warfare; but
Christ alone, when giving more, and infinitely more than all, thou dost
not receive. And what is this so great hostility? What is this so great
enmity? Where will there be any excuse or defense left for thee, when
the reasons for which thou preferrest man to man avail not to induce
thee to prefer God to man?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p63">Why dost thou commit thy treasure to the earth?
“Give it into my hand,” He saith. Doth not the
earth’s Lord seem to thee more worthy of trust than the earth?
This indeed restoreth that which thou laidest in it, though oftentimes
not even this, but He gives thee also recompense for His keeping of it?
For indeed He doth exceedingly love us. Therefore if thou shouldest
wish to lend, He stands ready; or to sow, He receives it; or if thou
shouldest wish to build, He draws thee unto Himself, saying, Build in
my regions. Why runnest thou unto poor, unto beggarly men, who also for
little gains occasion thee great trouble? Nevertheless, not even on
hearing these things, do we make up our minds to it, but where are
fightings and wars, and wild struggles,<note n="2800" id="iii.LXXIII-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p64"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXIII-p64.1">παγκρτια</span>.</p></note>and trials and suits of law, and false accusations, thither do we

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p65">5. Doth He not justly turn away from us, and punish us,
when He is giving up Himself unto us for all things, and we are
resisting Him? It is surely plain to all. For whether thou art desirous
to adorn thyself, “Let it, He saith, be with my ornaments;”
or to arm thyself, “with my arms,” or to clothe thyself,
“with my raiment;” or to feed thyself, “at my
table;” or to journey, “on my way;” or to inherit,
“my inheritance;” or to enter into a country, “the
city of which I am builder and maker;” or to build a house,
“amongst my tabernacles.” “For I, so far from asking
thee for a recompense of the things that I give thee, to even make
myself owe thee a recompense for this very thing, if thou be willing to
use all I have.” What can be equal to this munificence, “I
am Father, I am brother, I am bridegroom, I am dwelling place, I am
food, I am raiment, I am root, I am foundation, all whatsoever thou
willest, I am.” “Be thou in need of nothing, I will be even
a servant, for I came to minister, not to be ministered unto; I am
friend, and member, and head, and brother, and sister, and mother; I am
all; only cling thou closely<note n="2801" id="iii.LXXIII-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p66"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXIII-p66.1">οκεω

thee, in the tomb for thee, above I intercede for thee to the Father;
on earth I am come for thy sake am ambassador from my Father. Thou art
all things to me, brother, and joint heir, and friend, and
member.” What wouldest thou more? Why dost thou turn away from
Him, who loveth thee? Why dost thou labor for the world? Why dost thou
draw water into a broken cistern? For it is this to labor for the
present life. Why dost thou comb wool into the fire? Why dost thou
“beat the air?”<note n="2802" id="iii.LXXIII-p66.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIII-p67"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. ix. 26" id="iii.LXXIII-p67.1" parsed="|1Cor|9|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.9.26">1 Cor. ix.

minded? I see nothing but bones, and a worm, and a spider’s web;
all those things are earth, all those a fable, all a dream, and a
shadow, and a bare relation, and a picture, or rather not so much as a
picture. For the picture we see at least in a likeness, but here not so
much as a likeness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p72">And would that the evils stop with this. For now the
honor, and the luxury, and the distinction, end with a shadow, with
words; but the consequences of them, are no longer limited to a shadow
and to words, but continue, and will pass over with us elsewhere, and
will be manifest to all, the rapine, the covetousness, the
fornications, the adulteries, the dreadful things beyond number; these
not in similitude, neither in ashes, but written above, both words and
deeds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p73">With what eyes then shall we behold Christ? For if any
one could not bear to see his father, when conscious to himself that he
had sinned against him, upon Him who infinitely exceeds a father in
forbearance how shall we then look? how shall we bear it? For indeed we
shall stand at Christ’s judgment-seat, and there will be a strict
inquiry into all things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p74">But if any man disbelieve the judgments to come, let him
look at the things here, at those in the prisons, those in the mines,
those on the dunghills, the possessed, the frantic, them that are
struggling with incurable diseases, those that are fighting against
continual poverty, them that live in famine, them that are pierced with
irremediable woes, those in captivity. For these persons would not
suffer these things here, unless vengeance and

<pb n="444" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_444.html" id="iii.LXXIII-Page_444" />

punishments were to await all the others also
that have committed such sins. And if the rest have undergone nothing
here, you ought to regard this very fact as a sign that there is surely
something to follow after our departure here. For the self-same God of
all would not take vengeance on some, and leave others unpunished, who
have committed the same or more grievous offenses, unless He designed
to bring some punishments upon them there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIII-p75">By these arguments then and these examples let us also
humble ourselves; and let them who are obstinate unbelievers of the
judgment believe it henceforth, and become better men; that having
lived here in a manner worthy of the kingdom, we may attain unto the
good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p8">But not for this intent only did He put forward this

For thus, wherever He is minded to speak of that which will assuredly
come to pass, He brings forward the necessary courses of nature, both
Himself, and the blessed Paul imitating Him. Therefore also when

then, one may ask, did He say, “This generation?” Speaking
not of the generation then living, but of that of the believers. For He
is wont to distinguish a generation not by times only,

perish, and the more part of the Jews shall be destroyed, but over this
generation shall nothing prevail, not famine, not pestilence, not

hath found them true (for so he surely will find them) from what is
past, let him believe also the things to come, and let him search out
all things with diligence, and he will see the actual events bearing
witness to the truth of the prophecy. And the elements He hath brought
forward, at once to declare, that the church is of more honor than
Heaven and earth, and at the same time to indicate Himself by this also
to be maker of all. For since He was speaking of the end, a thing
disbelieved by many, He brought forward Heaven and earth, indicating
His unspeakable power, and showing with great authority, that He is
Lord of all, and by these things rendering His sayings deserving of

mouths, that they should not seek to learn what these angels know not;
and by saying, “neither the Son,” forbids them not only to
learn, but even to inquire. For in proof that therefore He said this,
see after His resurrection, when He saw they were become over curious,
how He stopped their mouths more decidedly. For now indeed He hath
mentioned infallible signs, many and endless; but then He saith merely,
“It is not for you to know times or seasons.” And then that
they might not say, we are driven to perplexity, we are utterly
scorned, we are not held worthy so much as of this, He says,

to make the thing awful, and to exclude that of which He had spoken

when will He know it? Will it be together with us? But who would say
this? And the Father He knoweth clearly, even as clearly as He knoweth

the times and the seasons, and had brought it to the very doors
(“for it is near,” He saith, “even at the
doors”), He was silent as to the day. For if thou seek after the
day and hour, thou shalt not hear them of me, saith He; but if of times
and preludes, without hiding anything, I will tell thee all
exactly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p31">For that indeed I am not ignorant of it, I have shown by
many things; having mentioned intervals, and all the things that are to
occur, and how short from this present time until the day itself (for
this did the parable of the fig tree indicate), and I lead thee to the
very vestibule; and if I do not open unto thee the doors, this also I
do for your good.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p32">And that thou mayest learn by another thing also, that
the silence is not a mark of ignorance on His part, see, together with
what we have mentioned, how He sets forth another sign also. “But
as in the days of Noe they were eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day that the flood came, and took all
away; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.”<note n="2824" id="iii.LXXIV-p32.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p33"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 38, 39" id="iii.LXXIV-p33.1" parsed="|Matt|24|38|24|39" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.38-Matt.24.39">Matt. xxiv.
38, 39</scripRef>. [The passage is
abridged.]</p></note> And these things He spake, showing that He should come on a sudden, and
unexpectedly, and when the more part were living luxuriously. For Paul
too saith this, writing on this wise, “When they shall speak of
peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them;” and
to show how unexpected, He said, “as travail upon a woman with
child.”<note n="2825" id="iii.LXXIV-p33.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p34"><scripRef passage="1 Thess. v. 3" id="iii.LXXIV-p34.1" parsed="|1Thess|5|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.3">1 Thess. v.
3</scripRef>.</p></note> How then doth He say, “after the tribulation of those
days?” For if there be luxury then, and peace, and safety, as
Paul saith, how doth He say, “after the tribulation of those
days?” If there be luxury, how is there tribulation? Luxury for
them that are in a state of insensibility and peace. Therefore He said
not, when there is peace, but “when they speak of peace and
safety,” indicating their insensibility to be such as of those in
Noah’s time, for that amid such evils they lived in luxury.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p35">But not so the righteous, but they were passing their
time in tribulation and dejection. Whereby He shows, that when
Antichrist is come, the pursuit of unlawful pleasures shall be more
eager among the transgressors, and those that have learnt to despair of
their own salvation. Then shall be gluttony, then revellings, and
drunkenness. Wherefore also most of all He puts forth an example
corresponding to the thing. For like as when the ark was making, they
believed not, saith He; but while it was set in the midst of them,
proclaiming beforehand the evils that are to come, they, when they saw
it, lived in pleasure, just as though nothing dreadful were about to
take place; so also now, Antichrist indeed shall appear, after whom is
the end, and the punishments at the end, and vengeance intolerable; but
they that are held by the intoxication of wickedness shall not so much
as perceive the dreadful nature of the things that are on the point of
being done. Wherefore also Paul saith, “as travail upon a woman
with child,” even so shall those fearful and incurable evils come
upon them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p36">And wherefore did He not speak of the ills in Sodom? It
was His will to introduce an example embracing all men,<note n="2826" id="iii.LXXIV-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p37"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXIV-p37.1">καθολικν</span>.</p></note>and disbelieved after it was foretold. So therefore, as by the more
part the things to come are disbelieved, He confirms those things by
the past, terrifying their minds. And together with the points I have
mentioned, He shows this also, that of the former things also He was
the doer. Then again He sets another sign, by all which things He makes
it evident, that He is not ignorant of the day. And what is the sign?
“Then shall two be in the field; one shall be taken, and one

turn them from their inquiry. So for this cause He spake also of the

unexpectedly, when they were thus without thought, and “two women
grinding at the mill,” which also of itself is not the employment

servants as masters should be both taken and left, both those who are
at ease, and those in toil, as well from the one rank as from the

nigh to the very hour, and had placed them there, again He deters them
from the inquiry, from a desire that they should be striving always.

this, He did not tell it.</p>

may watch, that they may be always ready; therefore He saith, When ye
look not for it, then He will come, desiring that they should be
anxiously waiting, and continually in virtuous action.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p48">But His meaning is like this: if the common sort of men
knew when they were to die, they would surely strive earnestly at that
hour.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p49">3. In order therefore that they may strive, not at that
hour only, therefore He tells them not either the common hour, or the
hour of each, desiring them to be ever looking for this, that they may
be always striving. Wherefore He made the end of each man’s life
also uncertain.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p50">After this, He openly calls Himself Lord, having nowhere
spoken so distinctly. But here He seems to me also to put to shame the
careless, that not even as much care as they that expect a thief have
taken for their money, not even this much do these take for their own
soul. For they indeed, when they expect it, watch, and suffer none of
the things in their house to be carried off; but ye, although knowing
that He will come, and come assuredly, continue not watching, saith He,
and ready so as not to be carried away hence unprepared. So that the
day cometh unto destruction for them that sleep. For as that man, if he
had known, would have escaped, so also ye, if ye be ready, escape
free.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p51">Then, as He had fallen upon the mention of the judgment,
He directs His discourse to the teachers next, speaking of punishment

that continue in sin, making His discourse to close with that which is
alarming.</p>

these things, but as compassing objects such as became Him: in the case
of Adam, that He might drive him to make an excuse for his sin: in that
of the Sodomites, that He might teach us never to be positive, till we
are present at the very deeds; in that of the prophet, that the
prediction might not appear in the judgment of the foolish a kind of
compulsion to disobedience; and in the parable in the gospel, that He
might show that they ought to have done this, and to have reverenced
the Son: but here, as well that they may not be curious, nor over busy
again, as that He might indicate that this was a rare and precious
thing. And see of what great ignorance this saying is indicative, if at
least He know not even him that is set over. For He blesses him indeed,
“For blessed,” saith He, “is that servant;” but
He saith not who this is. “For who is he,” He saith,
“whom His Lord shall set over?” and, “Blessed is he
whom He shall find so doing.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p64">But these things are spoken not of money

only, but also of speech, and of power, and of
gifts, and of every stewardship, wherewith each is entrusted. This
parable would suit rulers in the state also, for every one is bound to
make full use of what he hath for the common advantage. If it be wisdom
thou hast, if power, if wealth, if what it may, let it not be for the
hurt of thy fellow-servants, neither for thine own ruin. For this
cause, therefore, He requires both things of him, wisdom, and fidelity:
for sin arises from folly also. He calls him faithful then, because he
hath purloined nothing, neither misspent his Lord’s goods without
aim or fruit; and wise, because he knew how to dispense the things
given him, according as was fit. For indeed we have need of both
things, as well not to purloin the goods of our Master, as also to
dispense them as is fit. But if the one be wanting, the other halteth.
For if he be faithful and steal not, yet were to waste and to spend
upon that which concerned him not, great were the blame; and if he
should know how to dispense it well, yet were to purloin, again there
is no common charge against him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p65">And let us also that have money listen to these things.
For not unto teachers only doth He discourse, but also unto the rich.
For either sort were entrusted with riches; those that teach with the
more necessary wealth, ye with what is inferior. When then at the time
that the teachers are scattering abroad the greater, ye are not willing
to show forth your liberality even in the less, or rather not
liberality but honesty (for ye give the things of another), what excuse
will you have? But now, before the punishment of them that do the
contrary things, let us hear the honor of him that approveth himself.
“For verily I say unto you, He will set him over all His
goods.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p66">What can be equal to this honor? what manner of speech
will be able to set forth the dignity, the blessedness, when the King
of Heaven, He that possesseth all things, is about to set a man over
“all His goods?” Wherefore also He calleth him wise,
because he knew, not to give up great things for small, but having been
temperate here, hath attained to Heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p67">4. After this, as He ever doth, not by the honor only
laid up for the good, but also by the punishment threatened against the
wicked, doth He correct the hearers. Wherefore also He added,
“But and if the evil servant say in his heart, my Lord delayeth
His coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and shall eat
and drink with the drunken: the Lord of that servant shall come in a

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p71">But if any one should say, Seest thou what a thought
hath entered into his mind, because of the day’s not being known,
“my Lord,” he saith, “delayeth His coming?” we
should affirm, that it was not because the day is not known, but
because the servant is evil. Else wherefore came not this thought into
the heart of the faithful and wise servant. For what, even though the
Lord tarry, O wretched man, surely thou lookest that He will come. Why
then dost thou not take care?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p72">Hence then we learn, that He doth not so much as tarry.
For this judgment is not the Lord’s, but that of the evil
servant’s mind, wherefore also he is blamed for this. For in
proof that He doth not tarry, hear Paul saying, “The Lord is at
hand, be careful for nothing;”<note n="2844" id="iii.LXXIV-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p73"><scripRef passage="Phil. iv. 5, 6" id="iii.LXXIV-p73.1" parsed="|Phil|4|5|4|6" osisRef="Bible:Phil.4.5-Phil.4.6">Phil. iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p75">But do thou hear also what followeth, and learn how
continually He reminds them of their ignorance of the day, showing that
this is profitable to the servants, and fitted to waken and thoroughly
to rouse them. For what though some gained nothing hereby? For neither
by other things profitable for them were some profited, but
nevertheless He ceaseth not to do His part.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p76">What then is the purport of that which followeth?
“For He shall come in a day when he looketh not for Him, and in
an hour that he is not aware of;”<note n="2846" id="iii.LXXIV-p76.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p77"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxiv. 50" id="iii.LXXIV-p77.1" parsed="|Matt|24|50|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.24.50">Matt. xxiv.
50</scripRef>.</p></note>and shall inflict upon him extreme punishment. Seest thou how even
everywhere He puts this, the fact of their ignorance, indicating that
it was profitable, and by this making them always earnest minded? For
this is the point at which He labors, that we should be always on the
watch; and since it is always in luxury that we are supine, but in
afflictions we are braced up, therefore everywhere He saith this, that
when there is relaxation, then come the terrors. And as further back He
showed this by the example of Noah, even so here He saith it is, when
that servant is drunken, when he is beating, and that his punishment
shall be intolerable.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p78">But let us not regard only the punishment appointed for
him, but let us look to this other point too, lest we ourselves also be
un

awares to ourselves doing the
same things. For to this servant are they like, who have money, and
give not to the needy. For thou too art steward of thine own
possessions, not less than he who dispenses the alms of the church. As
then he has not a right to squander at random and at hazard the things
given by you for the poor, since they were given for the maintenance of
the poor; even so neither mayest thou squander thine own. For even
though thou hast received an inheritance from thy father, and hast in
this way all thou possessest: even thus all are God’s. And then
thou for thy part desirest that what thou hast given should be thus
carefully dispensed, and thinkest thou not that God will require His
own of us with greater strictness, or that He suffers them to be wasted
at random? These things are not, they are not so. Because for this end,
He left these things in thine hand, in order “to give them their
meat in due season.” But what meaneth, “in due
season?” To the needy, to the hungry. For like as thou gavest to
thy fellow-servant to dispense, even so doth the Lord will thee too to
spend these things on what is needful. Therefore though He was able to
take them away from thee, He left them, that thou mightest have
opportunity to show forth virtue; that bringing us into need one of
another, He might make our love for one another more fervent.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p79">But thou, when thou hast received, so far from giving,
dost even beat. And yet if not to give be blame, what excuse is there
for beating? But this, it seems to me, He speaks, hinting at the
insolent, and the covetous, and indicating the charge to be heavy, when
they beat them, whom they were commanded to feed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p80">5. But He seemeth to be here hinting also at those that
live in luxury, since for luxury too there is laid up a great
punishment. “For He eateth and drinketh,” it is said,
“with the drunken,” pointing at gluttony. For not for this
purpose didst thou receive, that thou should spend it on luxury, but
that thou shouldest lay it out on alms. What! are they thine own things
which thou hast? With the goods of the poor hast thou been entrusted,
though thou be possessed of them by honest labor, or though it be by
inheritance from thy father. What, could not God have taken away these
things from thee? But He doth not this, to give thee power to be
liberal to the poor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p81">But mark thou, I pray thee, how throughout all the
parables He punishes them that lay not out their money upon the needy.
For neither had the virgins robbed other men’s goods, but they
had not given their own; neither had he that buried the one talent
embezzled, but he had not doubled; neither are they that overlooked the
hungry punished, because they seized the possessions of others, but
because they did not lay out their own, like as also this servant.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p82">Let us hearken, as many as please the belly, as many as
lay out on costly banquets the riches that pertain not at all to us,
but belong to the needy. For do not, because out of great love to man
thou art commanded to give as of thine, therefore suppose these things
to be indeed thine own. He lent them to thee, that thou mightest be
able to approve thyself. Do not then suppose them to be thine, when
giving Him His own. For neither, if thou hadst lent to any one, that he
might go and be able to find means of gain, wouldest thou say the money
was his. To thee then also hath God given, that thou mightest traffic
for Heaven. Make not then the exceeding greatness of His love to man a
cause of ingratitude.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p83">Consider of what prayer it were a worthy object, to be
able to find after baptism a way to do away one’s sins. If He had
not said this, Give alms, how many would have said, Would it were
possible to give money, and so be freed from the ills to come! But
since this hath become possible, again are they become supine.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p84">“But I give,” thou sayest. And what is this?
Thou hast not yet given as much as she, who cast in the two mites; or
rather not so much as the half, nor a very small part of what she gave,
but thou layest out the greater part on useless expenses, on banquets,
and drunkenness, and extreme extravagance; now bidding, now bidden; now
spending, now constraining others to spend; so that the punishment is
even rendered twofold for thee, both from what thyself doest, and what
thou movest others to do. See at any rate how He Himself blames His
servant for this. “For he eateth,” He saith, “and
drinketh with the drunken.” For not the drunken only, but those
that are with them, doth He punish, and very fitly, because (together
with corrupting their own selves) they make light also of the salvation
of others. But nothing does so much provoke God, as for us to be
inclined to overlook the things that concern our neighbor. Wherefore
showing His anger, He commands him to be cut asunder. Therefore He also
affirmed love to be a distinguishing mark of His disciples, since it is
altogether necessary that he who loveth should take thought for the
things of his beloved.</p>

<pb n="450" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_450.html" id="iii.LXXIV-Page_450" />

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p85">To this way then let us hold, for this is especially the
way that leads up to Heaven, which renders men followers of Christ,
which makes them, as far as possible, like God. See at any rate how
these virtues are more needful, which have their dwelling by this way.
And, if ye will, let us make an inquiry into them, and let us bring
forth the sentences from the judgment of God.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p86">Let there be then two ways of most holy life, and let
the one secure the goodness of him that practises it, but the other of
his neighbor also. Let us see whether is the more approved and leads us
to the summit of virtue. Surely he, who seeks his own things only, will
receive even from Paul endless blame, and when I say from Paul, I mean
from Christ, but the other commendations and crowns. Whence is this
evident? Hear what His language is to one, what to the other.
“Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s
wealth.”<note n="2847" id="iii.LXXIV-p86.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p87"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. x. 24" id="iii.LXXIV-p87.1" parsed="|1Cor|10|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.10.24">1 Cor. x.
24</scripRef>.</p></note> Seest thou he rejects the one, and brings in the other? Again,
“Let every one of you please his neighbor for good to
edification.” Then comes also the praise beyond words with an
admonition, “For even Christ pleased not Himself.”<note n="2848" id="iii.LXXIV-p87.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p88"><scripRef passage="Rom. xv. 2, 3" id="iii.LXXIV-p88.1" parsed="|Rom|15|2|15|3" osisRef="Bible:Rom.15.2-Rom.15.3">Rom. xv. 2,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p89">Even these judgments then are sufficient to show the
victory; but that this may be done even superabundantly, let us see
amongst good works, which are confined to ourselves, and which pass
over from us to others also. Fasting then, and lying on the bare
ground, and keeping virginity, and a self-denying life, these things
bring their advantage to the persons themselves who do them; but those
that pass from ourselves to our neighbors are almsgiving, teaching,
charity. Hear then Paul in this matter also saying, “Though I
bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be
burned, and have not charity, I am nothing profited.”<note n="2849" id="iii.LXXIV-p89.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p90"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. xiii. 3" id="iii.LXXIV-p90.1" parsed="|1Cor|13|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.3">1 Cor.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p92">But if ye be willing, from a third point also let us
compare them; and let the one fast, and deny himself, and be a martyr,
and be burnt to death, but let another delay his martyrdom for his
neighbor’s edification; and let him not only delay it, but let
him even depart without martyrdom; who will be the more approved after
his removal hence? We need not have many words, nor a long
circumlocution. For the blessed Paul is at hand, giving his judgment,
and saying, “To depart and to be with Christ is better,
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you;”<note n="2850" id="iii.LXXIV-p92.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p93"><scripRef passage="Philip. i. 23, 24" id="iii.LXXIV-p93.1" parsed="|Phil|1|23|1|24" osisRef="Bible:Phil.1.23-Phil.1.24">Philip. i.

edification. For this is in the highest sense to be with Christ, even
to be doing His will, but nothing is so much His will, as that which is
for one’s neighbor’s good.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p94">Wilt thou that I tell thee a fourth proof also of these
things? “Peter, lovest thou me,” saith He; “Feed my
sheep:”<note n="2851" id="iii.LXXIV-p94.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p95"><scripRef passage="John xxi. 15-17" id="iii.LXXIV-p95.1" parsed="|John|21|15|21|17" osisRef="Bible:John.21.15-John.21.17">John xxi.
15–17</scripRef>.</p></note>and having asked him a third time, declared this to be an infallible
proof of love. But not to priests only is this said, but to every one
of us also, who are also entrusted with a little flock. For do not
despise it, because it is a little flock: For “my Father,”
He saith, “hath pleasure in them.”<note n="2852" id="iii.LXXIV-p95.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p96"><scripRef passage="Luke xii. 32" id="iii.LXXIV-p96.1" parsed="|Luke|12|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.12.32">Luke xii.

let the man, as soon as he has risen from his bed, seek after nothing
else, but how he may do and say something whereby he may render his
whole house more reverent. The woman again, let her be indeed a good
housekeeper; but before attending to this, let her have another more
needful care, that the whole household may work the works of Heaven.
For if in worldly matters, before attending to the affairs of our
household, we labor diligently to pay public dues, that we may not for
our undutifulness in these matters be beaten and dragged to the market
places, and suffer ten thousand unseemly things; much more ought we to
do this in things spiritual, and to render what is due to God, the King
of all, first, that we may not come to that place, “where is
gnashing of teeth.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p97">And after these virtues let us seek, which together with
our own salvation will be able in the greatest degree to profit our
neighbor. Such is almsgiving, such is prayer, or rather even this
latter is by the former made efficacious, and furnished with wings.
“For thy prayers,” it is said, “and thine alms are
come up for a memorial before God.”<note n="2853" id="iii.LXXIV-p97.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p98"><scripRef passage="Acts x. 4" id="iii.LXXIV-p98.1" parsed="|Acts|10|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.10.4">Acts x.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> But not prayers only, but fasting also hath its strength from hence.
Shouldest thou fast without almsgiving; the act is not so much as
counted for fasting; but such a one is worse than a gluttonous man and
a drunkard; and so much worse, as cruelty is a more grievous thing than
luxury. And why do I speak of fasting? Though thou practise
self-denial, though thou practise virginity, thou art set without the
bridechamber, if thou hast not almsgiving. And yet what is equal to
virginity, which not even in the new dispensation hath come under the
compulsion of law, on account of its high excellence? but nevertheless
it is cast

<pb n="451" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_451.html" id="iii.LXXIV-Page_451" />

out, when it hath not
almsgiving. But if virgins are cast out, because they have not this in
due abundance, who will be able without this to obtain pardon? There is
no man, but he must quite of necessity perish, who hath not this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p99">For, if in worldly matters no man lives for himself, but
artisan, and soldier, and husbandman, and merchant, all of them
contribute to the common good, and to their neighbor’s advantage;
much more ought we to do this in things spiritual. For this is most
properly to live: since he at least who is living for himself only, and
overlooking all others, is useless, and is not so much as a human
being, nor of our race.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p100">What then, thou wouldest say, if I neglect my own
interests, while seeking after the good of the rest? It is not
possible, for one who seeks after the good of the rest to overlook his
own; for he who seeks after the good of the rest pains no man, but
pities all, helps them to the utmost of his powers; will rob no man,
will covet the goods of no man, will not steal, will not bear false
witness; will abstain from all wickedness, will apply himself to all
virtue, and will pray for his enemies, and do good to them that plot
against him, and will neither revile any, nor speak ill of them, though
he hear from them ten thousand evil things; but will speak the words of
the apostle: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended,
and I burn not?”<note n="2854" id="iii.LXXIV-p100.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIV-p101"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. xi. 29" id="iii.LXXIV-p101.1" parsed="|2Cor|11|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.11.29">2 Cor. xi.

the rest will follow.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIV-p102">By all which things being persuaded that it is not
possible for one to be saved, who hath not looked to the common good,
and seeing this man that was cut asunder, and him that buried his
talent, let us choose this way, that we may also attain unto eternal
life, unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, world without
end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c48" id="iii.LXXV-p4">“Then shall the kingdom of Heaven,” He
saith, “be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and
went forth to meet the bridegroom. But five of them were wise, and the
other five foolish, which took not,” He saith,
“oil.”</p>

<p class="c58" id="iii.LXXV-p5">“Then, while the bridegroom tarried, they all
slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet Him. And the five arose, and being
in perplexity, said to the wise, Give us of your oil. But they
consented not, saying, Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you;
go to them that sell, and buy.”</p>

<p class="c58" id="iii.LXXV-p6">“And while they were gone for this, the bridegroom
came, and those went in; but these came afterwards, saying, Lord, Lord,
open to us. But He answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
not. Watch therefore, for ye know not the day, nor the hour.”</p>

<p class="c59" id="iii.LXXV-p7"><i>“Then He spake again another parable. A man
travelling into a far country, called his own servants, and delivered
unto them his goods; to one five talents, to another two, to another
one, to every man according to his several ability, and took his
journey. Then, when the two had brought him the double, he that had
been entrusted with the one talent brought it alone, and being blamed
saith, I knew that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not
sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed; and I</i>

<pb n="452" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_452.html" id="iii.LXXV-Page_452" />

<i>was afraid, and hid thy talent; lo! there
thou hast that is thine. His Lord answered and said, Thou wicked
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I have not sown, and gather
where I have not strawed: thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and then at my coming I might have received mine own
with usury. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that
hath ten talents. For to him that hath shall be given, and he shall
have more abundantly; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away
even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into
outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.”</i></p>

<p class="c12" id="iii.LXXV-p8"><span class="c11" id="iii.LXXV-p8.1">These</span> parables are like the
former parable of the faithful servant, and of him that was ungrateful
and devoured his Lord’s goods. For there are four in all, in
different ways admonishing us about the same things, I mean about
diligence in almsgiving, and about helping our neighbor by all means
which we are able to use, since it is not possible to be saved in
another way. But there He speaks more generally of all assistance which
should he rendered to one’s neighbor; but as to the virgins, he
speaketh particularly of mercifulness in alms, and more strongly than
in the former parable. For there He punishes him that beats, and is
drunken, and scatters and wastes his lord’s goods, but here even
him that doth not help, nor spends abundantly his goods upon the needy.
For they had oil indeed, but not in abundance, wherefore also they are
punished.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p9">But wherefore doth He set forth this parable in the
person of the virgins, and doth not merely suppose any person whatever?
Great things had He spoken of virginity, saying, “There are
eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
Heaven’s sake;” and, “He that is able to receive, let
him receive it.”<note n="2856" id="iii.LXXV-p9.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 12" id="iii.LXXV-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|19|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.12">Matt. xix.
12</scripRef>.</p></note> He knew also that the generality of men would have a great opinion of
it. For indeed the work is by nature great, and is shown so by this,
that neither under the old dispensation was it fulfilled by these
ancient and holy men, nor under the new was it brought under the
compulsion of the law. For He did not command this, but left it to the
choice of his hearers. Wherefore Paul also said “Now, concerning
virgins I have no commandment of the Lord.”<note n="2857" id="iii.LXXV-p10.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p11"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 25" id="iii.LXXV-p11.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.25">1 Cor. vii.
25</scripRef>.</p></note>“For though I praise him that attains thereto, yet I constrain
not him that is not willing, neither do I make the thing an
injunction.” Since then the thing is both great in itself and
hath great honor with the multitude, lest any one attaining to this
should feel as though he had attained to all, and should be careless
about the rest, He putteth forth this parable sufficient to persuade
them, that virginity, though it should have everything else, if
destitute of the good things arising out of almsgiving, is cast out
with the harlots, and He sets the inhuman and merciless with them. And
most reasonably, for the one was overcome by the love of carnal
pleasure, but these<note n="2858" id="iii.LXXV-p11.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p12"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXV-p12.1">α δ</span>.</p></note>of money. But the love of carnal pleasure and of money are not equal,
but that of carnal pleasure is far keener and more tyrannical. And the
weaker the antagonist, the less excusable are these<note n="2859" id="iii.LXXV-p12.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p13"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXV-p13.1">α
νικηθεσαι</span>.</p></note>that are overcome thereby. Therefore also He calls them foolish, for
that having undergone the greater labor, they have betrayed all for
want of the less. But by lamps here, He meaneth the gift itself of
virginity, the purity of holiness; and by oil, humanity, almsgiving,
succor to them that are in need.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p14">“Then, while the bridegroom tarried, they all
slumbered and slept.” He shows that the time intervening will not
be short, leading His disciples away from the expectation that His
kingdom was quite immediately to appear. For this indeed they hoped,
therefore He is continually holding them back from this hope. And at
the same time He intimates this too, that death is a sleep. For they
slept, He saith.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p15">“And about midnight there was a cry made.”
Either He was continuing the parable, or again He shows that the
resurrection will be at night. But the cry Paul also indicates, saying,
“With a shout, with a voice of an archangel, with the last trump,
He shall come down from Heaven.”<note n="2860" id="iii.LXXV-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p16"><scripRef passage="1 Thess. 4.16; 1 Cor. 15.52" id="iii.LXXV-p16.1" parsed="|1Thess|4|16|0|0;|1Cor|15|52|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Thess.4.16 Bible:1Cor.15.52">1 Thess. iv. 16 (comp. 1 Cor. xv. 52</scripRef>).</p></note> And what mean the trumpets, and what saith the cry? “The
bridegroom cometh.” When therefore they had trimmed their lamps,
the foolish say unto the wise, “Give us of your oil.” Again
He calls them foolish, showing that nothing can be more foolish than
they who are wealthy here, and depart naked thither, where most of all
we have need of humanity, where we want much oil. But not in this
respect only were they foolish, but also because they looked to receive
it there, and sought it out of season; and yet nothing could be more
humane than those virgins,

<pb n="453" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_453.html" id="iii.LXXV-Page_453" />

who for
this especially were approved. Neither do they seek for it all, for,
“Give us,” they say, “of your oil;” and the
urgency of their need is indicated; “for our lamps,” they
say, “are going out.” But even so they failed, and neither
the humanity of those whom they asked, nor the easiness of their
request, nor their necessity and want, made them obtain.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p17">But what now do we learn from hence? That no man can
protect us there, if we are betrayed by our works, not because he will
not, but because he cannot. For these too take refuge in the
impossibility. This the blessed Abraham also indicated, saying,
“Between us and you there is a great gulf,”<note n="2861" id="iii.LXXV-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p18"><scripRef passage="Luke xvi. 26" id="iii.LXXV-p18.1" parsed="|Luke|16|26|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.26">Luke xvi.
26</scripRef>.</p></note>so that not even when willing is it permitted them to pass it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p19">“But go to them that sell, and buy.” And who
are they that sell? The poor. And where are these? Here, and then
should they have sought them, not at that time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p20">2. Seest thou what great profit arises to us from the
poor? shouldest thou take them away, thou wouldest take away the great
hope of our salvation. Wherefore here must we get together the oil,
that it may be useful to us there, when the time calls us. For that is
not the time of collecting it, but this. Spend not then your goods for
nought in luxury and vainglory. For thou wilt have need of much oil
there.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p21">Having heard these things, those virgins went their way;
but they profited nothing. And this He saith, either pursuing the
parable, and working it up; or also by these things showing, that
though we should become humane after our departure, we shall gain
nothing from thence towards our escape. Therefore neither did their
forwardness avail these virgins, because they went to them that sell
not here, but there; nor the rich man, when he became so charitable, as
even to be anxious about his relations. For he that was passing by him
that was laid at the gate, is eager to rescue from perils and from hell
them whom he did not so much as see, and entreats that some be sent to
tell them these things. But nevertheless, he derived no benefit from
thence, as neither did these virgins. For when they having heard these
things went their way, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready
went in with Him, but the others were shut out. After their many
labors, after their innumerable toils, and that intolerable fight, and
those trophies which they had set up over the madness of natural
appetite, disgraced, and with their lamps gone out, they withdrew,
bending down their faces to the earth. For nothing is more sullied than
virginity not having mercy; so that even the multitude are wont to call
the unmerciful dark. Where then was the profit of virginity, when they
saw not the bridegroom? and not even when they had knocked did they
obtain, but they heard that fearful saying, “Depart, I know you
not.”<note n="2862" id="iii.LXXV-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p22"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 12" id="iii.LXXV-p22.1" parsed="|Matt|25|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.12">Matt. xxv.

intolerable punishment; or rather, this word is more grievous even than
hell. This word He speaks to them also that work iniquity.<note n="2863" id="iii.LXXV-p22.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p23">See <scripRef passage="Matt. vii. 23" id="iii.LXXV-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|7|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.23">Matt.

ignorance concerning our departure hence? Where now are they, who
throughout all their life are remiss, but when they are blamed by us,
are saying, At the time of my death, I shall leave money to the poor.
Let them listen to these words, and be amended. For indeed at that time
many have failed of this, having been snatched away at once, and not
permitted so much as to give charge to their relations touching what
they wished to be done.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p26">This parable was spoken with respect to mercy in alms;
but the one that comes after this, to them that neither in money, nor
in word, nor in protection, nor in any other things whatever, are
willing to assist their neighbors, but withhold all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p27">And wherefore can it be that this parable brings forward
a king, but that a bridegroom? That thou mightest learn how close
Christ is joined unto the virgins that strip themselves of their
possessions; for this indeed is virginity. Wherefore Paul also makes
this as a definition of the thing. “The unmarried woman careth
for the things of the Lord;”<note n="2865" id="iii.LXXV-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p28"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 34, 35" id="iii.LXXV-p28.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|34|7|35" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.34-1Cor.7.35">1 Cor. vii.
34, 35</scripRef>.</p></note>such are his words: and, “For that which is comely, and that ye
may attend upon the Lord without distraction. These things we
advise,” he saith.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p29">And if in Luke the parable of the talents is otherwise
put, this is to be said, that the one is really different from the
other. For in that, from the one capital different degrees of increase
were made, for from one pound one brought five, another ten; wherefore
neither did they obtain the same recompense; but here, it is the
contrary, and the crown is accordingly equal. For he that received two
gave two, and he that had received the five again in like manner; but
there since from the same beginning one made the greater,

<pb n="454" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_454.html" id="iii.LXXV-Page_454" />

one the less, increase; as might be expected,
in the rewards also, they do not enjoy the same.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p30">But see Him everywhere, not requiring it again
immediately. For in the case of the vineyard, He let it out to
husbandmen, and went into a far country; and here He committed to them
the talents, and took His journey, that thou mightest learn His
long-suffering. And to me He seems to say these things, to intimate the
resurrection. But here it is no more a vineyard and husbandmen, but all
servants. For not to rulers only, nor to Jews, but to all, doth He
address His discourse. And they who bring a return unto Him confess
frankly, both what is their own, and what their Master’s. And the
one saith, Lord, “Thou gavest me five talents;” and the
other saith, “two,” indicating that from Him they received
the source of their gain, and they are very thankful, and reckon all to
Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p31">What then saith the Master? “Well done, thou
good” (for this is goodness to look to one’s neighbor)

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p33">But not so that other one, but how? “I knew that

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p36">What could be more gentle than this? For men indeed do
not so, but him that hath put out the money at usury, even him do they
make also responsible to require it again. But He not so; but, Thou
oughtest, He saith, to have put it out, and to have committed the
requiring of it again to me. And I should have required it with
increase; by increase upon the hearing, meaning the showing forth of
the works. Thou oughtest to have done that which is easier, and to have
left to me what is more difficult. Forasmuch then as he did not this,
“Take,” saith He, “the talent from him, and give it

limited for him that is slothful, but even intolerable is the
punishment, and with the punishment the sentence, which is full of a
heavy accusation. For “cast ye,” saith He, “the
unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.”<note n="2871" id="iii.LXXV-p38.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p39"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 30" id="iii.LXXV-p39.1" parsed="|Matt|25|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.30">Matt. xxv.

doer of evil things, but also he that doeth not good things, is

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p40">Let us hearken then to these words. As we have
opportunity, let us help on our salvation, let us get oil for our
lamps, let us labor to add to our talent. For if we be backward, and
spend our time in sloth here, no one will pity us any more hereafter,
though we should wail ten thousand times. He also that had on the
filthy garments condemned himself, and profited nothing. He also that
had the one talent restored that which was committed to his charge, and
yet was condemned. The virgins again entreated, and came unto Him and
knocked, and all in vain, and without effect.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p41">Knowing then these things, let us contribute alike
wealth, and diligence, and protection,<note n="2872" id="iii.LXXV-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p42"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXV-p42.1">προστασαν</span>
.</p></note>and all things for our neighbor’s advantage. For the talents here
are each person’s ability, whether in the way of protection, or
in money, or in teaching, or in what thing soever of the kind. Let no
man say, I have but one talent, and can do nothing; for thou canst even
by one approve thyself. For thou art not poorer than that widow; thou
art not more uninstructed than Peter and John, who were both
“unlearned and ignorant men;”<note n="2873" id="iii.LXXV-p42.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p43"><scripRef passage="Acts iv. 13" id="iii.LXXV-p43.1" parsed="|Acts|4|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.4.13">Acts iv.
13</scripRef>.</p></note>but nevertheless, since they showed forth a zeal, and did all things
for the common good, they attained to Heaven. For nothing is so
pleasing to God, as to live for the common advantage.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p44">For this end God gave us speech, and hands, and feet,
and strength of body, and mind, and understanding, that we might use
all these things, both for our own salvation, and for our
neighbor’s advantage. For not for hymns only and thanksgivings is
our speech serviceable to us, but it is profitable also for instruction
and admonition. And if indeed we used it to this end, we should be
imitating our Master; but if for the opposite ends, the devil. Since
Peter also, when he

<pb n="455" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_455.html" id="iii.LXXV-Page_455" />

confessed the
Christ, was blessed, as having spoken the words of the Father; but when
he refused the cross, and dissuaded it, he was severely reproved, as
savoring the things of the devil. But if where the saying was of
ignorance, so heavy is the blame, when we of our own will commit many
sins, what favor shall we have?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p45">Such things then let us speak, that of themselves they
may be evidently the words of Christ. For not only if I should say,
“Arise, and walk;”<note n="2874" id="iii.LXXV-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. ix. 5" id="iii.LXXV-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|9|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.9.5">Matt. ix.

40</scripRef>.</p></note>then only do I speak Christ’s words, but much more if being
reviled I bless, if being despitefully used I pray for him that doeth
despite to me. Lately indeed I said, that our tongue is a hand laying
hold on the feet of God; but now much more do I say, that our tongue is
a tongue imitating the tongue of Christ, if it show forth the
strictness that becometh us, if we speak those things which He wills.
But what are the things which He wills us to speak? Words full of
gentleness and meekness, even as also He Himself used to speak, saying
to them that were insulting Him, “I have not a devil;”<note n="2876" id="iii.LXXV-p47.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p48"><scripRef passage="John viii. 49" id="iii.LXXV-p48.1" parsed="|John|8|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.8.49">John viii.

“demon.”]</p></note>and again, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the
evil.”<note n="2877" id="iii.LXXV-p48.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p49"><scripRef passage="John xviii. 23" id="iii.LXXV-p49.1" parsed="|John|18|23|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.23">John xviii.
23</scripRef>.</p></note> If thou also speak in this way; if thou speak for thy neighbor’s
amendment, thou wilt obtain a tongue like that tongue. And these things
God Himself saith; “For he that bringeth out the precious from
the vile, shall be as my mouth;”<note n="2878" id="iii.LXXV-p49.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p50"><scripRef passage="Jer. xv. 19" id="iii.LXXV-p50.1" parsed="|Jer|15|19|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Jer.15.19">Jer. xv.
19</scripRef>.</p></note>such are His words.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p51">When therefore thy tongue is as Christ’s tongue,
and thy mouth is become the mouth of the Father, and thou art a temple
of the Holy Ghost, then what kind of honor could be equal to this? For
not even if thy mouth were made of gold, no nor even of precious
stones, would it shine like as now, when lit up with the ornament of
meekness. For what is more lovely than a mouth that knoweth not how to
insult, but is used to bless <i>and give good words</i>? But if thou
canst not bear to bless him that curses thee, hold thy peace, and
accomplish but this for the time; and proceeding in order, and striving
as thou oughtest, thou wilt attain to that other point also, and wilt
acquire such a mouth, as we have spoken of.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p52">4. And do not account the saying to be rash. For the
Lord is loving to man, and the gift cometh of His goodness. It is rash
to have a mouth like the devil, to have a tongue resembling that of an
evil demon, especially for him that partakes of such mysteries, and
communicates of the very flesh of the Lord. Reflecting then on these
things, become like Him, to the utmost of thy power. No longer then
will the devil be able so much as to look thee in the face, when thou
art become such a one as this. For indeed he recognizes the image of
the King, he knows the weapons of Christ, whereby he was worsted. And
what are these? Gentleness and meekness. For when on the mountain
Christ overthrew and laid low the devil who was assaulting him, it was
not by making it known that He was Christ, but He entrapped him by
these sayings, He took him by gentleness, he turned him to flight by
meekness. Thou also must do this; shouldest thou see a man become a
devil, and coming against thee, even so do thou likewise overcome.
Christ gave thee also power to become like Him, so far as thy ability
extends. Be not afraid at hearing this. The fear is not to be like Him.
Speak then after His manner, and thou art become in this respect such
as He, so far as it is possible for one who is a man to become so.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p53">Wherefore greater is he that thus speaks, than he that
prophecies. For this is entirely a gift, but in the other is also thy
labor and toil. Teach thy soul to frame thee a mouth like to
Christ’s mouth. For it can create such things, if it will; it
knows the art, if it be not remiss. And how is such a mouth made? one
may ask. By what kind of colorings? by what kind of material? By no
colorings, indeed, or material; but by virtue only, and meekness, and
humility.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p54">Let us see also how a devil’s mouth is made; that
we may never frame that. How then is it made? By curses, by insults, by
envy, by perjury. For when any one speaks his words, he takes his
tongue. What kind of excuse then shall we have; or rather, what manner
of punishment shall we not undergo; when this our tongue, wherewith we
are allowed to taste of the Lord’s flesh, when this, I say, we
overlook, speaking the devil’s words?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p55">Let us not overlook it, but let us use all diligence, in
order to train it to imitate its Lord. For if we train it to this, it
will place us with great confidence at Christ’s judgment seat.
Unless any one know how to speak thus, the judge will not so much as
hear him. For like as when the judge chances to be a Roman, he will not
hear the defense of one who knows not how to speak thus; so likewise
Christ, unless thou speak after His fashion, will not hear thee, nor
give heed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p56">Let us learn therefore to speak in such wise as our
Judge is wont to hear; let it be

<pb n="456" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_456.html" id="iii.LXXV-Page_456" />

our endeavor to imitate that tongue. And
shouldest thou fall into grief, take heed lest the tyranny of
despondency pervert thy tongue, but that thou speak like Christ. For He
too mourned for Lazarus and Judas. Shouldest thou fall into fear, seek
again to speak even as He. For He Himself fell into fear for thy sake,
with regard to His manhood.<note n="2879" id="iii.LXXV-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p57"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXV-p57.1">κατ τν

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p59">But while the brutes have from nature their
unfruitfulness, and fruitfulness, these have it from choice, wherefore
some are punished, and the others crowned. And He doth not punish them,
until He hath pleaded with them; wherefore also, when He hath put them
in their place, He mentions the charges against them. And they speak
with meekness, but they have no advantage from it now; and very
reasonably, because they passed by a work so much to be desired. For
indeed the prophets are everywhere saying this, “I will have
mercy and not sacrifice,”<note n="2881" id="iii.LXXV-p59.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p60"><scripRef passage="Hosea vi. 6" id="iii.LXXV-p60.1" parsed="|Hos|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Hos.6.6">Hosea vi.

works; and nature herself taught it.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p61">But mark them, how they are destitute not of one or two
things only, but of all. For not only did they fail to feed the hungry,
or clothe the naked; but not even did they visit the sick, which was an
easier thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p62">And mark how easy are His injunctions. He said not,
“I was in prison, and ye set me free; I was sick, and ye raised
me up again;” but, “ye visited me,” and, “ye
came unto me.” And neither in hunger is the thing commanded
grievous. For no costly table did He seek, but what is needful only,
and His necessary food, and He sought in a suppliant’s garb, so
that all things were enough to bring punishment on them; the easiness
of the request, for it was bread; the pitiable character of Him that
requesteth, for He was poor; the sympathy of nature, for He was a man;
the desirableness of the promise, for He promised a kingdom; the
fearfulness of the punishment, for He threatened hell. The dignity of
the one receiving, for it was God, who was receiving by the poor; the
surpassing nature of the honor, that He vouchsafed to condescend so
far; His just claim for what they bestowed, for of His own was He
receiving. But against all these things covetousness once for all
blinded them that were seized by it; and this though so great a threat
was set against it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p63">For further back also He saith, that they who receive
not such as these shall suffer more grievous things than Sodom; and
here He saith, “Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the least
of these my brethren, ye did it not unto me.”<note n="2882" id="iii.LXXV-p63.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p64"><scripRef passage="Matt. 25.45,40" id="iii.LXXV-p64.1" parsed="|Matt|25|45|0|0;|Matt|25|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.45 Bible:Matt.25.40">Matt. xxv. 45; comp. verse 40</scripRef>.

least. Why, for this reason they are brethren, because they are lowly,
because they are poor, because they are outcast. For such doth He most
invite to brotherhood, the unknown, the contemptible, not meaning by
these the monks only, and them that have occupied the mountains, but
every believer; though he be a secular person, yet if he be hungry, and
famishing, and naked, and a stranger, His will is he should have the
benefit of all this care. For baptism renders a man a brother, and the
partaking of the divine mysteries.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p65">2. Then, in order that thou mayest see in another way
also the justice of the sentence, He first praises them that have done
right, and saith, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you before

gave me meat,” and all that follows.<note n="2883" id="iii.LXXV-p65.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p66"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 34-40" id="iii.LXXV-p66.1" parsed="|Matt|25|34|25|40" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.34-Matt.25.40">Matt. xxv.

fellow-servants; like as the virgins by the virgins, and the servant
that was drunken and gluttonous by the faithful servant, and him that
buried his talent, by them that brought the two, and each one of them
that continue in sin, by them that have done right.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p67">And this comparison is sometimes made in the case of an
equal, as here, and in the instance of the virgins, sometimes of him
that hath advantage, as when he said, “The men of Nineveh shall
rise up and shall condemn this generation, because they believed at the
preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here;”
and, “The queen of the south shall condemn this generation,
because she came to hear the wisdom of Solomon;”<note n="2884" id="iii.LXXV-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p68"><scripRef passage="Matt. xii. 41, 42" id="iii.LXXV-p68.1" parsed="|Matt|12|41|12|42" osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.41-Matt.12.42">Matt. xii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p71">And here, however, it is of an equal; for he compares
rich with rich, and poor with poor. And not in this way only doth He
show the sentence justly passed, by their fellow-servants having done
what was right when in the same circumstances, but also by their not
being obedient so much as in these things in which poverty was no
hindrance; as, for instance, in giving drink to the thirsty, in looking
upon him that is in bonds, in visiting the sick. And when He had
commended them that had done right, He shows how great was originally
His bond of love towards them. For, “Come,” saith He,
“ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world.” To how many good things is
this same equivalent, to be blessed, and blessed of the Father? And
wherefore were they counted worthy of such great honors? What is the
cause? “I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty,
and ye gave me drink;” and what follows.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p72">Of what honor, of what blessedness are these words? And
He said not, Take, but, “Inherit,” as one’s own, as
your Father’s, as yours, as due to you from the first. For,
before you were, saith He, these things had been prepared, and made
ready for you, forasmuch as I knew you would be such as you are.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p73">And in return for what do they receive such things? For
the covering of a roof, for a garment, for bread, for cold water, for
visiting, for going into the prison. For indeed in every case it is for
what is needed; and sometimes not even for that. For surely, as I have
said, the sick and he that is in bonds seeks not for this only, but the
one to be loosed, the other to be delivered from his infirmity. But He,
being gracious, requires only what is within our power, or rather even
less than what is within our power, leaving to us to exert our
generosity in doing more.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p74">But to the others He saith, “Depart from me, ye
cursed,” (no longer of the Father; for not He laid the curse upon
them, but their own works), “into the everlasting fire,
prepared,” not for you, but “for the devil and his
angels.” For concerning the kingdom indeed, when He had said,
“Come, inherit the kingdom,” He added, “prepared for
you before the foundation of the world;” but concerning the fire,
no longer so, but, “prepared for the devil.” I, saith He,
prepared the kingdom for you, but the fire no more for you, but
“for the devil and his angels;” but since ye cast
yourselves therein, impute it to yourselves. And not in this way only,
but by what follows also, like as though He were excusing Himself to
them, He sets forth the causes.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p75">“For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no
meat.” For though He that came to thee had been thine enemy, were
not His sufferings enough to have overcome and subdued even the
merciless? hunger, and cold, and bonds, and nakedness, and sickness,
and to wander everywhere houseless? These things are sufficient even to
destroy enmity. But ye did not these things even to a friend, being at
once friend, and benefactor, and Lord. Though it be a dog we see
hungry, often we are overcome; and though we behold a wild beast, we
are subdued; but seeing the Lord, art thou not subdued? And wherein are
these things worthy of defense?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p76">For if it were this only, were it not sufficient for a
recompense? (I speak not of hearing such a voice, in the presence of
the world, from Him that sitteth on the Father’s throne, and of
obtaining the kingdom), but were not the very doing it sufficient for a
reward? But now even in the presence of the world, and at the appearing
of that unspeakable glory, He proclaims and crowns thee, and
acknowledges thee as His sustainer and host, and is not ashamed of
saying such things, that He may make the crown brighter for thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p77">So for this cause, while the one are punished justly,
the others are crowned by grace. For though they had done ten thousand

<pb n="458" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_458.html" id="iii.LXXV-Page_458" />

things, the munificence were of
grace, that in return for services so small and cheap, such a heaven,
and a kingdom, and so great honor, should be given them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p78">“And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished
these sayings,<note n="2887" id="iii.LXXV-p78.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p79">[R.V., “words;” the word

that are for a season, when such good things await you?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p81">3. But mark thou, I pray thee, how He hath in all His
first sayings after a new manner worked up and thrown into the shade
what was most painful to them. For He said not, Ye know that after two
days I am betrayed, but, “Ye know that after two days is the
passover,”<note n="2889" id="iii.LXXV-p81.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p82">[A clause is omitted here: “and then He brings

is being kept for the salvation of the world, and that with
foreknowledge He suffered all. So then, as though this were sufficient
consolation for them, He did not even say anything to them now about a
resurrection; for it was superfluous, after having discoursed so much
about it, to speak of it again. And moreover, as I said, He shows that
even His very passion is a deliverance from countless evils, having by
the passover reminded them of the ancient benefits in Egypt.</p>

found hindrance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p86">And how many high priests were there? For the law wills
there should be one, but then there were many. Whence it is manifest,
that the Jewish constitution had begun to dissolve. For Moses, as I
said, commanded there should be one, and that when he was dead there
should be another, and by the life of this person He measured the
banishment of them that had involuntarily committed manslaughter. How
then were there at that time many high priests? They were afterwards
made for a year. And this the evangelist declared, when he was speaking
of Zacharias, saying, that he was of the course of Abia. Those
therefore doth he here call high priests, who had been high
priests.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p87">What did they consult together? That they might seize
Him secretly, or that they might put Him to death? Both; for they
feared the people. Wherefore also they waited for the feast to be past;
for “they said, Not on the feast day.”<note n="2891" id="iii.LXXV-p87.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p88">[“Not during the feast.”]</p></note> For the devil, lest he should make the passion conspicuous, was not
willing it should take place at the passover; but they, lest there
should be an uproar. Mark them then ever fearing, not the ills from
God, neither lest any greater pollution should arise to them from the
season, but in every case the ills from men.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p89">Yet for all this, boiling with anger, they changed their
purpose again. For though they had said, “Not at the feast
time;” when they found the traitor, they waited not for the time,
but slew Him at the feast. But why did they take Him then? They were
boiling with rage, as I said; and they expected then to find Him, and
all things they did as blinded. For though He Himself made the greatest
use of their wickedness for His own dispensation, they were not surely
for this guiltless, but deserving of inflictions without number for
their temper of mind. At least when all should be set free, even the
guilty, then these men slew the guiltless, Him that had conferred on
them countless benefits, and who for a time had neglected the Gentiles
for their sake. But O loving-kindness! them that were thus depraved,
them that were <i>thus froward, and</i><note n="2892" id="iii.LXXV-p89.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p90">[The words in italics are not sustained by the <span class="c20" id="iii.LXXV-p90.1">mss</span>. collated by Field.—R.]</p></note>full of countless evils, He again saves, and sends the apostles to be
slain in their behalf, and by the apostles makes entreaty. “For
we are ambassadors for Christ.”<note n="2893" id="iii.LXXV-p90.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p91"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. v. 20" id="iii.LXXV-p91.1" parsed="|2Cor|5|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.20">2 Cor. v.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p92">Having then such patterns as these, I say not, let us
die for our enemies, for we ought to do even this; but since we are too
feeble for this, I say for the present, at least let us not look with
an evil eye upon our friends, let us not envy our benefactors. I say
not for the present, let us do good to them that evil entreat us, for I
desire even this; but

since you
are too gross for this, at least avenge not yourselves. What is our
condition, a scene, and acting? Wherefore can it be that ye set
yourselves directly against the acts enjoined? It is not for nought
that all else hath been written and how many things He did at the very
cross sufficient to recall them to Him; but that thou mightest imitate
His goodness, that thou mightest emulate His lovingkindness. For indeed
He cast them to the ground, and restored the servant’s ear, and
discoursed with forbearance; and great miracles did He show forth, when
lifted up, turning aside the sunbeams, bursting the rocks, raising the
dead, frightening by dreams the wife of him that was judging Him, at
the very judgment showing forth all meekness (which was of power not
less than miracles to gain them over), forewarning them of countless
things in the judgment hall; on the very cross crying aloud,
“Father, forgive them their sin.”<note n="2894" id="iii.LXXV-p92.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p93"><scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 34" id="iii.LXXV-p93.1" parsed="|Luke|23|34|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.34">Luke xxiii.

And having risen again, did he not straightway call the Jews? did He
not give them remission of sins? did He not set before them countless
blessings? What can be more strange than this? They that crucified Him,
and were breathing murder, after they crucified Him, became sons of
God.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p94">What can be equal to this tenderness? On hearing these
things let us hide our faces, to think that we are so far removed from
Him whom we are commanded to imitate. Let us at least see how great the
distance, that we may at any rate condemn ourselves, for warring with
these, in behalf of whom Christ gave His life, and not being willing to
be reconciled to them, whom that He might reconcile He refused not even
to be slain; unless this too be some expense, and outlay of money,
which ye object in almsgiving.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p95">4. Consider of how many things thou art guilty; and so
far from being backward to forgive them that have injured thee, thou
wilt even run unto them that have grieved thee, in order that thou
mayest have a ground for pardon, that thou mayest find a remedy for
thine own evil deeds.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p96">The sons of the Greeks, who look for nothing great, have
often shown self-command toward these: and thou who art to depart hence
with such hopes, shrinkest, and art slow to act; and that which time
effects, this thou endurest not to do before the time for God’s
law, but willest this passion to be quenched without reward, rather
than for a reward? For neither, if this should have arisen from the
time, wilt thou have any advantage, but rather great will be the
punishment, because, what time hath effected, this the law of God
persuaded thee not to do.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p97">But if thou sayest that thou burnest with the memory of
the insult; call to mind if any good hath been done thee by him that
hath offended thee, and how many ills thou hast occasioned to
others.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p98">Hath he spoken ill of thee, and disgraced thee? Consider
also that thou hast spoken thus of others. How then wilt thou obtain
pardon, which thou bestowest not on others? But hast thou spoken ill of
no one? But thou hast heard men so speaking, and allowed it. Neither is
this guiltless.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p99">Wilt thou learn how good a thing it is not to remember
injuries, and how this more than anything pleases God? Them that exult
over persons, justly chastised by Himself, He punishes. And yet they
are justly chastised; but thou shouldest not rejoice over them. So the
prophet having brought many accusations, added this also, saying,
“They felt nothing for the affliction of Joseph;”<note n="2895" id="iii.LXXV-p99.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p100"><scripRef passage="Amos vi. 6" id="iii.LXXV-p100.1" parsed="|Amos|6|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Amos.6.6">Amos vi.

for the place near her.”<note n="2896" id="iii.LXXV-p100.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXV-p101"><scripRef passage="Micah i. 11" id="iii.LXXV-p101.1" parsed="|Mic|1|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mic.1.11">Micah i.

and the neighbors of these others, were punished according to the
purpose of God; nevertheless, it is His will that we sympathize even
with these. For if we, being evil, when we are punishing a servant, if
we should see one of his fellow slaves laughing, we at the same time
are provoked the more, and turn our anger against him; much more will
God punish them that exult over those whom He chastises. But if upon
them that are chastised by God it is not right to trample, but to
grieve with them, much more with them that have sinned against us. For
this is love’s sign; love God prefers to all things. For as in
the royal purple, those are precious amongst the flowers and dyes,
which make up this robing; so here too, these virtues are the precious
ones, which preserve love. But nothing maintains love so much as the
not remembering them that have sinned against us.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p102">“Why? did not God guard the other side also? Why?
did He not drive him that hath done the wrong to him that is wronged?
Doth He not send him from the altar to the other, and so after the
reconciliation invite him to the table?” But do not therefore
wait for the other to come, since thus thou hast lost all. For to this
intent most especially doth He appoint unto thee an unspeaka

ble reward, that thou mayest prevent the
other, since, if thou art reconciled by his entreaties, the amity is no
longer the result of the divine command, but of the other party’s
diligence. Wherefore also thou goest away uncrowned, while he receives
the rewards.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p103">What sayest thou? Hast thou an enemy, and art thou not
ashamed? Why is not the devil enough for us, that we bring upon
ourselves those of our own race also? Would that not even he had been
minded to war against us; would that not even he were a devil!</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p104">Knowest thou not how great the pleasure after
reconciliation? For what, though in our enmity it appear not great? For
that it is sweeter to love him that doth us wrong than to hate him,
after the enmity is done away thou shalt be able to learn full
well.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p105">5. Why then do we imitate the mad, devouring one
another, warring against our own flesh?</p>

allowed even those things, not that we should do them one to another,

short-lived anger, but to remember injuries is the part of a soul that
practises itself in evil.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXV-p109">But hast thou suffered evil? yet nothing so great, as
thou wilt do to thyself by remembering injuries. And besides, it is not
so much as possible for a good man to suffer any evil. For suppose
there to be any man, having both children and a wife, and let him
practise virtue, and let him have moreover many occasions of being
injured, as well abundance of possessions, as sovereign power, and many
friends, and let him enjoy honor; only let him practise virtue, for
this must be added, and let us in supposition lay plagues upon him. And
let some wicked man come unto him, and involve him in losses. What then
is that to him who accounts money nothing? Let him kill his children.
What this to him, who learns to be wise touching the resurrection? Let
him slay his wife; what is this to him who is instructed not to sorrow

ourselves, and rendering our soul weak. For the vexation is not so much
from our neighbors’ wickedness, as from our weakness. Because of
this, should any one insult us, we weep, and frown; should any one rob
us, we suffer the same like those little children, which the more
clever of their companions provoke for nothing, grieving them for small
causes; but nevertheless these too, if they should see them vexed,
continue to tease them, but if laughing, they on the contrary leave
off. But we are more foolish even than these, lamenting for these

Luke, and the other by Matthew, Mark and John, but that Mary was the
person anointing on both occasions. This leads to the identification of
Mary, the sister of Lazarus, with Mary Magdalene. But there is no proof
that Luke refers to the latter. The opinion of Chrysostom seems to be
that Matthew, Mark and Luke refer to the same person, and John to
another on a different occasion. But to this there are insuperable
objections.—R.]</p></note>yet not so with John, but another person, one much to be admired, the
sister of Lazarus.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p6">But not without purpose did the evangelist mention the
leprosy of Simon, but in order that He might show whence the woman took
confidence, and came unto Him. For inasmuch as the leprosy seemed a
most unclean disease, and to be abhorred, and yet she saw Jesus had
both healed the man (for else He would not have chosen to have tarried
with a leper), and had gone into his house; she grew confident, that He
would also easily wipe off the uncleanness of her soul. And not for
nought doth He name the city also, Bethany, but that thou mightest
learn, that of His own will He cometh to His passion. For He who before
this was fleeing through the midst of them; then, at the time when
their envy was most kindled, comes near within about fifteen furlongs;
so completely was His former withdrawing Himself a part of a
dispensation.<note n="2904" id="iii.LXXVI-p6.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p7">Lit, an economy.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p8">The woman therefore having seen Him, and having taken
confidence from thence came unto Him. For if she that had the issue of
blood, although conscious to herself of nothing like this, yet because
of that natural seeming uncleanness, approached Him trembling and in
fear; much more was it likely this woman should be slow, and shrink
back because of her evil conscience. Wherefore also it is after many
women, the Samaritan, the Canaanite, her that had the issue of blood,
and other besides, that she cometh unto Him, being conscious to herself
of much impurity; and then not publicly but in a house. And whereas all
the others were coming unto Him for the healing of the body alone, she
came unto Him by way of honor only, and for the amendment of the soul.
For neither was she at all afflicted in body, so that for this most
especially one might marvel at her.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p9">And not as to a mere man did she come unto Him; for then
she would not have wiped His feet with her hair, but as to one greater
than man can be. Therefore that which is the most honorable member of
the whole body, this she laid at Christ’s feet, even her own
head.</p>

indignation,” such are the words, “saying, To what purpose
is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and
given to the poor. But when Jesus understood it, He said, Why trouble
ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me? For ye have the
poor always with you, but me ye have not always. For in that she hath
poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say

more will He not accept the anointing of oil.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p14">But though they thus thought, He knowing her intention
suffers her. For indeed great was her reverence, and unspeakable her
zeal; wherefore of this exceeding condescension, He permitted the oil
to be poured even on His head.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p15">For if He refused not to become man, and to be borne in
the womb, and to be fed at the breast, why marvellest thou, if He doth
not utterly reject this? For like as the Father suffered a savor of
meat, and smoke, even so did He the harlot, accepting, as I have
already said, her intention. For Jacob too anointed a pillar to God,
and oil was offered in the sacrifices, and the priests were anointed
with ointment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p16">But the disciples not knowing her purpose found fault
unseasonably, and by the things they laid to her charge, they show the
woman’s munificence. For saying, that it might have been sold for
three hundred pence, they showed how much this woman had spent on the
ointment, and how great generosity she had manifested. Wherefore He
also rebuked them, saying, “Why trouble ye the woman?” And
He adds a reason, as it was His will again to put them in mind of His
passion, “For she did it,” He said, “for my
burial.” And another reason. “For ye have the poor always
with you, but me ye have not always;” and, “Wheresoever the
gospel shall be preached, that shall be told also which this woman hath
done.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p17">Seest thou how again He declares beforehand the going
forth unto the Gentiles, in this way also consoling them for His death,
if after the cross His power was so to shine forth, that the gospel
should be spread abroad in every part of the earth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p18">Who then is so wretched as to set his face against so
much truth? For lo! what He said is come to pass, and to whatever part
of the earth thou mayest go, thou wilt see her celebrated.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p19">And yet neither was the person that did it
distinguished, nor had what was done many witnesses, neither was it in
a theatre, but in a house, that it took place, and this a house of some
leper, the disciples only being present.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p20">2. Who then proclaimed it, and caused it to be spread
abroad? It was the power of Him who is speaking these words. And while
of countless kings and generals the noble exploits even of those whose

and encompassed them with walls,<note n="2907" id="iii.LXXVI-p20.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p21">[A clause is omitted here: “and conquered in

much as by hearsay, nor by name, though they have both set up statues,

in the house of some leper, in the presence of ten men, this all men
celebrate throughout the world; and so great a time has passed, and yet
the memory of that which was done hath not faded away, but alike
Persians and Indians, Scythians and Thracians, and Sarmatians, and the
race of the Moors, and they that dwell in the British Islands, spread
abroad that which was done secretly in a house by a woman that had been
a harlot.<note n="2908" id="iii.LXXVI-p21.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p22">[This accords with the assumed identity with the
woman spoken of in <scripRef passage="Luke vii." id="iii.LXXVI-p22.1" parsed="|Luke|7|0|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7">Luke vii.</scripRef> But there seems to be no proof that
Chrysostom identified the woman with Mary Magdalene. Compare p. 41,
Homily VI. 8.—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p23">Great is the loving-kindness of the Lord. He endureth an
harlot, an harlot kissing his feet, and moistening them with oil, and
wiping them with her hair, and He receives her, and reproves them that
blame her. For neither was it right that for so much zeal the woman
should be driven to despair.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p24">But mark thou this too, how far they were now raised up
above the world, and forward in almsgiving. And why was it He did not
merely say, “She hath wrought a good work,” but before
this, “Why trouble ye the woman?” That they might learn not
at the beginning to require too high principles of the weaker sort.
Therefore neither doth He examine the act merely itself by itself, but
taking into account the person of the woman. And indeed if He had been
making a law, He would not have brought in the woman, but that thou
mightest learn that for her sake these things were said, that they
might not mar her budding faith, but rather cherish it, therefore He
saith it, teaching us whatever good thing may be done by any man,
though it be not quite perfect, to receive it, and encourage it, and
advance it, and not to seek all perfection at the beginning. For, that
at least He Himself would rather have desired this, is manifest from
the fact, that He required a bag to be borne, who had not where to lay
His head. But then the time demanded not this, that He should correct
the deed, but that He should accept it only. For even as, if any one
asked Him, without the woman’s having done it, He would not have
approved this; so, after she had done it, He looks to one thing only,
that she be not driven to perplexity by the reproof of the disciples,
but that she should go from His care, having been made more cheerful
and better. For indeed after the oil had been

<pb n="463" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_463.html" id="iii.LXXVI-Page_463" />

poured out, their rebuke had no seasonableness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p25">Do thou then likewise, if thou shouldest see any one
provide sacred vessels and offer them, and loving to labor upon any
other ornament of the church, about its walls or floor; do not command
what has been made to be sold, or overthrown, lest thou spoil his zeal.
But if, before he had provided them, he were to tell thee of it,
command it to be given to the poor; forasmuch as He also did this not
to spoil the spirit of the woman, and as many things as He says, He
speaks for her comfort.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p26">Then because He had said, “She hath done it for my
burial;” that He might not seem to perplex the woman, by making
mention of such a thing as this, His burial and death, I mean; see how
by that which follows He recovers her, saying, “What she hath
done shall be spoken of in the whole world.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p27">And this was at once consolation to His disciples, and
comfort and praise to her. For all men, He saith, shall celebrate her
hereafter; and now too hath she announced beforehand my passion, by
bringing unto me what was needed for a funeral, let not therefore any
man reprove her. For I am so far from condemning her as having done
amiss, or from blaming her as having not acted rightly, that I will not
suffer what hath been done to lie hid, but the world shall know that
which has been done in a house, and in secret. For in truth the deed
came of a reverential mind, and fervent faith, and a contrite soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p28">And wherefore did He promise the woman nothing
spiritual; but the perpetual memory? From this He is causing her to
feel a confidence about the other things also. For if she hath wrought
a good work, it is quite evident she shall receive a due reward.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p29">“Then went one of the twelve, he that was called
Judas Iscariot, unto the chief priests, and said unto them, What will
ye give me, and I will deliver Him unto you?”<note n="2909" id="iii.LXXVI-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 14, 15" id="iii.LXXVI-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|26|14|26|15" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.14-Matt.26.15">Matt. xxvi.

one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief
priests, and said, What are ye willing to give me,” etc.]</p></note> Then. When? When these things were spoken, when He had said, it is for
my burial, and not even thereby was he moved to compunction, neither
when he heard that the Gospel should be preached everywhere did he fear
(and yet it was the language of unspeakable power), but when women
showed so much honor, and women that had been harlots, then he wrought
the devil’s works.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p31">But what can be the reason they mention his surname?
Because there was also another Judas. And they do not shrink from
saying, He was of the twelve; so entirely do they hide none of those
things which seem to be matters of reproach. And yet they might have
said merely this, that he was one of the disciples, for there were
others besides. But now they add, of the twelve, as though they had
said, of the first company of those selected as the best, of them with
Peter and John. Because for one thing did they care, for truth alone,
not for concealing what things were done.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p32">For this cause many of the signs they pass by, but of
the things that appear to be matters of reproach they conceal nothing;
but though it be word, though it be deed, though it be what you will of
this kind, they proclaim it with confidence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p33">3. And not these only, but even John himself, who utters
the higher doctrines. For he most of all tells us of the affronts and
the reproachful things that were done unto Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p34">And see how great is the wickedness of Judas, in that he
comes unto them of his own accord, in that he does this for money, and
for such a sum of money.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p35">But Luke saith, that he conferred with the chief
captains.<note n="2910" id="iii.LXXVI-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p36"><scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 4" id="iii.LXXVI-p36.1" parsed="|Luke|22|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.4">Luke xxii.

those that should provide for their good order. For their government
had now undergone a change according to the prophecy.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p37">To these then he went and said, “What will ye give
me, and I will deliver him unto you. And they covenanted with him for
thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to
betray Him.”<note n="2911" id="iii.LXXVI-p37.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 15, 16" id="iii.LXXVI-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|26|15|26|16" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.15-Matt.26.16">Matt. xxvi.

alone.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p39">Oh madness! how did covetousness altogether blind him!
For he that had often seen Him when He went through the midst, and was
not seized, and when He afforded many demonstrations of His Godhead and
power, looked to lay hold on Him; and this while He was using like a
charm for him so many, both awful and soothing words, to put an end to
this evil thought. For not even at the supper did He forbear from this
care of him, but unto the last day discoursed to him of these things.
But he profited nothing. Yet not for that did the Lord cease to do His
part.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p40">Knowing this, then, let us also not intermit

<pb n="464" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_464.html" id="iii.LXXVI-Page_464" />

to do all things unto them that sin and
are remiss, warning, teaching, exhorting, admonishing, advising, though
we profit nothing. For Christ indeed foreknew that the traitor was
incorrigible, yet nevertheless He ceased not to supply what could be
done by Himself, as well admonishing as threatening and bewailing over
him, and nowhere plainly, nor openly, but in a concealed way. And at
the very time of the betrayal, He allowed him even to kiss Him, but
this benefited him nothing. So great an evil is covetousness, this made
him both a traitor, and a sacrilegious robber.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p41">Hearken, all ye covetous, ye that have the disease of
Judas; hearken, and beware of the calamity. For if he that was with
Christ, and wrought signs, and had the benefit of so much instruction,
because he was not freed from the disease, was sunk into such a gulf;
how much more shall ye, who do not so much as listen to the Scripture,
who are constantly riveted to the things present, become an easy prey
to this calamity, unless ye have the advantage of constant care. Every
day was that man with Him, who had not where to lay His head, and every
day was he instructed by deeds, and by words, not to have gold, nor
silver, nor two coats; and yet he was not taught self restraint; and
how dost thou expect to escape the disease, if thou hast not the
benefit of earnest attention, and dost not use much diligence? For
terrible, terrible is the monster, yet nevertheless, if thou be
willing, thou wilt easily get the better of him. For the desire is not
natural; and this is manifest from them that are free from it. For
natural things are common to all; but this desire has its origin from
remissness alone; hence it takes its birth, hence it derives its
increase, and when it has seized upon those who look greedily after it,
it makes them live contrary to nature. For when they regard not their
fellow countrymen, their friends, their brethren,<note n="2912" id="iii.LXXVI-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p42">[The words “their kinsmen” should be
inserted here.—R.]</p></note>in a word all men, and with these even themselves, this is to live
against nature. Whence it is evident that the vice and disease of
covetousness, wherein Judas, being entangled, became a traitor, is
contrary to nature. And how did he become such a one, you may say,
having been called by Christ? Because God’s call is not
compulsory, neither does it force the will of them who are not minded
to choose virtue, but admonishes indeed, and advises, and does and
manages all things, so as to persuade men to become good; but if some
endure not, it does not compel. But if thou wouldest learn from what
cause he became such as he was, thou wilt find him to have been ruined
by covetousness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p43">And how was he taken by this calamity? one may say.
Because he grew remiss. For hence arise such changes, as on the other
hand, those for the better from diligence. How many for instance that
were violent, are now more gentle than lambs? how many lascivious
persons have become afterwards continent? how many, heretofore
covetous, yet now have cast away even their own possessions? And the
contrary again has been the result of remissness. For Gehazi also lived
with a holy man, and he too became depraved from the same disease. For
this calamity is the most grievous of all. Hence come robbers of tombs,
hence menslayers, hence wars and fightings, and whatsoever evil thou
mayest mention, it cometh hence. And in every respect is such a one
useless, whether it be requisite to lead an army or to guide a people:
or rather not in public matters only, but also in private. If he is to
marry a wife, he will not take the virtuous woman, but the vilest of
all; if he have to buy a house, not that which becomes a free man, but
what can bring much rent; if he is to buy slaves, or what else it may
be, he will take the worst.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p44">And why do I speak of leading an army, and guiding a
people, and managing households; for should he be a king, he is the
most wretched of all men, and a pest to the world, and the poorest of
all men. For he will feel like one of the common sort, not accounting
all men’s possessions to be his, but himself to be one of all;
and when spoiling all men’s goods, thinks himself to have less
than any. For measuring the things present by his desire for those
whereof he is not yet possessed, he will account the former nothing
compared to the latter. Wherefore also one saith, “There is not a
more wicked thing than a covetous man.”<note n="2913" id="iii.LXXVI-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVI-p45"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 10.9" id="iii.LXXVI-p45.1" parsed="|Sir|10|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.10.9">Ecclus. x. 9</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p46">4. For such a one both setteth himself to sale, and
goeth about, a common enemy of the world, grieving that the earth doth
not bear gold instead of the corn, and the fountains instead of
streams, and the mountains instead of stone; vexed at the fruitfulness
of the seasons, troubled at common benefits; shunning every means
whence one cannot obtain money; undergoing all things whence one can
scrape together so much as two farthings; hating all men, the poor and
the rich; the poor, lest they should come and beg of him; the rich,
because he hath not their possessions. All men he accounts to be
possessed

<pb n="465" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_465.html" id="iii.LXXVI-Page_465" />

of what is his, and as
though he had been injured by all, so is he displeased with all. He
knows not plenty, he has no experience of satiety, he is more wretched
than any, even as, on the other hand, he that is freed from these
things, and practises self-restraint, is the most enviable. For the
virtuous man, though he be a servant, though a prisoner, is the most
happy of all men. For no one shall do him ill, no not though all men
should come together out of the world, setting in motion arms and
camps, and warring with him. But he that is depraved and vile, and such
as we have described, though he be a king, though he have on a thousand
diadems, will suffer the utmost extremities, even from a common hand.
So feeble is vice, so strong is virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p47">Why then dost thou mourn, being in a state of poverty.
Why wailest thou keeping a feast, for indeed it is an occasion of
feasting. Why weepest thou, for poverty is a festival, if thou be wise.
Why lamentest thou, thou little child; for such a one we should call a
little child. Did such a person strike thee? What is this, he made thee
more able to endure? But did he take away thy money? He hath removed
the greater part of thy burden. But hath he cut off thine honor? Again
thou tellest me of another kind of freedom. Hear even those without
teaching wisdom touching these things, and saying, “Thou hast
suffered no ill, if thou show no regard to it.” But hath he taken
away that great house of thine, which hath enclosures about it? But
behold the whole earth is before thee, the public buildings, whether
thou wouldest have them for delight, or for use. And what is more
pleasing or more beautiful than the firmament of Heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p48">How long are ye poor and needy? It is not possible for
him to be rich, who is not wealthy in his soul; like as it is not
possible for him to be poor, who hath not the poverty in his mind. For
if the soul is a nobler thing than the body, the less noble parts have
not power to affect it after themselves; but the noble part draws over
unto herself, and changes those that are not so noble. For so the
heart, when it has received any hurt, affects the whole body
accordingly; if its temperament be disordered, it mars all, if it be
rightly tempered, it profits all. And if any of the remaining parts
should have become corrupt, while this remains sound, it easily shakes
off what is evil in them also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p49">And that I may further make what I say more plain, what
is the use, I pray thee, of verdant branches, when the root is
withering? and what is the harm of the leaves being withered above,
while this is sound? So also here there is no use of money, while the
soul is poor; neither harm from poverty, when the soul is rich. And how
can a soul, one may say, be rich, being in want of money? Then above
all times might this be; for then also is it wont to be rich.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p50">For if, as we have often shown, this is a sure proof of
being rich, to despise wealth, and to want nothing; and of poverty
again, to want, and any one would more easily despise money in poverty
than in wealth, it is quite evident that to be in poverty rather makes
one to be rich. For indeed that the rich man sets his heart on money
more than the poor man, is surely plain to every one; like as the
drunken man is thirsty, rather than he that hath partaken of drink
sufficiently. For neither is his desire such as to be quenched by too
much; but, on the contrary, it is its nature to be inflamed by this.
For fire likewise, when it has received more food, then most of all
waxes fierce; and the tyranny of wealth, when thou hast cast into it
more gold, then most especially is increased.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p51">If then the desiring more be a mark of poverty; and he
that is in the possession of riches is like this; he is especially in
poverty. Seest thou that the soul then most of all is poor, when it is
rich; and then is rich, when it is in poverty?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p52">And if thou wilt, let us exercise our reasoning in
persons also, and let there be two, the one having ten thousand
talents, the other ten, and from both let us take away these things.
Who then will grieve the most? He that hath lost the ten thousand. But
he would not have grieved more, unless he had loved it more; but if he
loves more, he desires more; but if he desires more, he is more in
poverty. For this do we most desire, of which we are most in want, for
desire is from want. For where there is satiety, there cannot be
desire. For then are we most thirsty, when we have most need of
drink.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVI-p53">And all these things have I said, to show that if we be
vigilant, no one shall harm us; and that the harm arises not from
poverty but from ourselves. Wherefore I beseech you with all diligence
to put away the pest of covetousness, that we may both be wealthy here,
and enjoy the good things eternal, unto which God grant we may all
attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

the evening, wherefore also each adds, when the passover was

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p9">And they say, “Where wilt Thou that we prepare for
Thee to eat the passover?” So even from this it is manifest, that
He had no house, no place of sojourning; and I suppose neither had
they. For surely they would have entreated him to come there. But
neither had they any, having now parted with all things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p10">But wherefore did He keep the passover? To indicate by
all things unto the last day, that He is not opposed to the law.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p11">And for what possible reason doth He send them to an
unknown person? To show by this also that He might have avoided
suffering. For He who prevailed over this man’s mind, so that he
received them, and that by words; what would He not have done with them
that crucified Him, if it had been His will not to suffer? And what He
did about the ass, this He did here also. For there too He saith,
“If any man say aught unto you, ye shall say, that the Lord hath
need of them;”<note n="2918" id="iii.LXXVII-p11.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p12"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxi. 3" id="iii.LXXVII-p12.1" parsed="|Matt|21|3|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.21.3">Matt. xxi.

at thy house.” But I marvel not at this only, that he received
Him, being unknown, but that expecting to bring upon himself such
enmity and implacable hostility, he despised the enmity of the
multitude.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p13">After this, because they knew him not, He gave them a

of his power. For He did not only say, “I will keep the
passover,” but He adds another thing also, “My time is at
hand.” And this He did, at once continually reminding His
disciples of the passion, so that exercised by the frequency of the
prediction, they should be prepared for what was to take place; and at
the same time to show to themselves, and to him that was receiving Him,
and to all the Jews, which I have often mentioned, that not
involuntarily doth He come to His passion. And He adds, “with my
disciples,” in order that both the preparation should be
sufficient, and that the man should not suppose that He was concealing
Himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p19">For when the disciples had done, as Jesus had appointed
them, “when the even was come, He sat down with the twelve.<note n="2922" id="iii.LXXVII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p20">[See note 7, p. 485.]</p></note> And as they did eat, He said,” we are told, “Verily, I say

“one of you,” so as again to give him power of repentance
by concealment. And He chooseth to alarm all, for the sake of saving
this man. Of you, the twelve, saith He, that are everywhere present
with me, whose feet I washed, to whom I promised so many things.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p22">Intolerable sorrow thereupon seized that holy company.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p26">Mark at what time He discovered him. It was when it was
His will to deliver the rest from this trouble, for they were even dead
with the fear, wherefore also they were instant with their questions.
But not only as desiring to deliver them from their distress He did
this, but also as willing to amend the traitor. For since after having
often heard it generally, he continued incorrigible, being past
feeling, He being minded to make him feel more, takes off his mask.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p27">For when being sorrowful they began to say, “Is it
I, Lord? He answered and said, He that dippeth<note n="2927" id="iii.LXXVII-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p28">[The words “his hand” are omitted.]</p></note>with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The Son of Man goeth, as

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p31">Now some say that he was so bold as not to honor his
Master, but to dip with Him: but to me Christ seems to have done this
too, to shame him the more, and bring him over to a better disposition.
For this act again has something more in it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p32">2. But these things we ought not to pass by at random,
but they should be infixed in our minds, and wrath would find no place
at any time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p33">For who, bearing in mind that supper, and the traitor
sitting at meat with the Saviour of all, and Him who was to be betrayed
thus meekly reasoning, would not put away all venom of wrath and anger?
See at any rate how meekly He conducts Himself towards him, “The
Son of Man goeth, as it is written of Him.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p34">And these things again He said, both to restore the
disciples, that they might not think the thing was a sign of weakness,
and to amend the traitor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p35">“But woe unto that<note n="2930" id="iii.LXXVII-p35.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p36">[Here “that” is given as in the received
text.—R.]</p></note>man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! it had been good for that man
if he had not been born.” See again in His rebukes His
unspeakable meekness. For not even here with invective, but more in the
way of compassion, doth He apply what He saith, but in a disguised way
again; and yet not his former senselessness only, but his subsequent
shamelessness was deserving of the utmost indignation. For after this
conviction he saith, “Is it I, Lord?”<note n="2931" id="iii.LXXVII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 25" id="iii.LXXVII-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|26|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.25">Matt. xxvi.

below.—R.]</p></note> Oh insensibility! He inquires, when conscious to himself of such
things. For the evangelist too, marvelling at his boldness, saith this.
What then saith the most mild and gentle Jesus? “Thou
sayest.” And yet He might have said, O thou unholy, thou all
unholy one; accursed, and profane; so long a time in travail with
mischief, who hast gone thy way, and made satanical compacts, and hast
agreed to receive money, and hast been convicted by me too, dost thou
yet dare to ask? But none of these things did He say; but how?
“Thou sayest?” fixing for us bounds and rules of long
suffering.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p38">But some one will say, Yet if it was written that He was
to suffer these things, wherefore is Judas blamed, for he did the
things that were written? But not with this intent, but from
wickedness. For if thou inquire not concerning the motive, thou wilt
deliver even the devil from the charges against him. But these things
are not, they are not so. For both the one and the other are deserving
of countless punishments, although the world was saved. For neither did
the treason of Judas work out salvation for us, but the wisdom of
Christ, and the good contrivance of His fair skill, using the
wickednesses of others for our advantage.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p39">“What then,” one may say, “though
Judas had not betrayed Him, would not another have betrayed Him?”
And what has this to

<pb n="468" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_468.html" id="iii.LXXVII-Page_468" />

do with the
question? “Because if Christ must needs be crucified, it must be
by the means of some one, and if by some one, surely by such a person
as this. But if all had been good, the dispensation in our behalf had
been impeded.” Not so. For the Allwise knows how He shall bring
about our benefits, even had this happened. For His wisdom is rich in
contrivance, and incomprehensible. So for this reason, that no one
might suppose that Judas had become a minister of the dispensation, He
declares the wretchedness of the man. But some one will say again,
“And if it had been good if he had never been born, wherefore did
He suffer both this man, and all the wicked, to come into the
world?” When thou oughtest to blame the wicked, for that having
the power not to become such as they are, they have become wicked, thou
leavest this, and busiest thyself, and art curious about the things of
God; although knowing that it is not by necessity that any one is
wicked.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p40">“But the good only should be born,” he would
say, “and there were no need of hell, nor punishment, nor
vengeance, nor trace of vice, but the wicked should either not be born
at all, or being born should straightway depart.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p41">First then, it were well to repeat to thee the saying of
the apostle, “Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against
God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast Thou
made me thus?”<note n="2932" id="iii.LXXVII-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p42"><scripRef passage="Rom. ix. 20" id="iii.LXXVII-p42.1" parsed="|Rom|9|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Rom.9.20">Rom. ix.

thou make me thus?”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p43">But if thou still demandest reasons, we would say this,
that the good are more admired for being among the bad; because their
long-suffering and great self-command is then most shown. But thou
takest away the occasion of their wrestlings, and conflicts, by saying
these things. “What then, in order that these may appear good,
are others punished?” saith he. God forbid, but for their own
wickedness. For neither because they were brought into the world did
they become wicked, but on account of their own wickedness; wherefore
also they are punished. For how should they fail to be deserving of
punishment, seeing they have so many teachers of virtue, and gain
nothing therefrom. For like as the noble and good are worthy of double
honor, because they both became good, and took no hurt from the wicked;
so also the worthless deserve twofold punishment, both because they
became wicked, when they might have become good (they show it who have
become such), and because they gained nothing from the good.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p44">But let us see what saith this wretched man, when
convicted by his Master. What then saith he? “Is it I,
Rabbi?”<note n="2933" id="iii.LXXVII-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 25" id="iii.LXXVII-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|26|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.25">Matt. xxvi.

knowledge by its being said, “one of you;” but when He had
made him manifest, he ventured again to ask, confiding in the clemency
of his Master, that He would not convict him.<note n="2934" id="iii.LXXVII-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p46">[A sentence is omitted here: “On this account,
therefore, he also calls Him ‘Rabbi.’”—R.]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p47">3. O blindness! Whereunto hath it led him? Such is
covetousness, it renders men fools and senseless, yea reckless, and
dogs instead of men, or rather even more fierce than dogs, and devils
after being dogs. This man at least received unto him the devil even
when plotting against him, but Jesus, even when doing him good, he
betrayed, having already become a devil in will. For such doth the
insatiable desire of gain make men, out of their mind, frenzy-smitten,
altogether given up to gain, as was the case even with Judas.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p48">But how do Matthew and the other evangelists say, that,
when he made the agreement touching the treason, then the devil seized
him; but John, that “after the sop Satan entered into
him.”<note n="2935" id="iii.LXXVII-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p49"><scripRef passage="John xiii. 27" id="iii.LXXVII-p49.1" parsed="|John|13|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.13.27">John xiii.

him?” Because he enters not in suddenly, nor at once, but makes
much trial first, which accordingly was done here also. For after
having tried him in the beginning, and assailed him quietly, after that
he saw him prepared to receive him, he thenceforth wholly breathed
himself into him, and completely got the better of him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p51">But how, if they were eating the passover, did they eat

the world was to be brought about, and the mysteries to be delivered,
and the subjects of sorrow to be done away with by His death; so
welcome was the cross to Him. But nothing softened the savage monster,
nor

moved, nor shamed him. He
pronounced him wretched, saying, “Woe to that man.” He
alarmed him again, saying, “It were good for him if he had not
been born.” He put him to shame, saying, “To whom I shall
give a sop, when I have dipped it.” And none of these things
checked him, but he was seized by covetousness, as by some madness, or
rather by a more grievous disease. For indeed this is the more grievous
madness.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p55">For what would the madman do like this? He poured not
forth foam out of his mouth but he poured forth the murder of his Lord.
He distorted not his hands, but stretched them out for the price of
precious blood. Wherefore his madness was greater, because he was mad
being in health.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p56">But he doth not utter <i>sayest thou</i>, sounds without

not smite the ground with his feet struggling? Nay, how much better so
to struggle, than thus to stand upright. But sayest thou, he did not
cut himself with stones? Yet how much better, than to do such things as
these!</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p58">Will ye, that we bring forward the possessed and the
covetous, and make a comparison between the two. But let no one account
what is done a reproach to himself. For we do not reproach the nature,
but we lament the act. The possessed was never clad with garments,
cutting himself with stones, and running, he rushes over rough paths,
driven headlong of the devil. Do not these things seem to be dreadful?
What then, if I shall show the covetous doing more grievous things than
these to their own soul, and to such a degree more grievous, that these
are considered child’s play compared with those. Will you indeed
shun the pest? Come then, let us see if they are in any respect in a
more tolerable state than they. In none, but even in a more grievous
condition; for indeed they are more objects of shame than ten thousand
naked persons. For it were far better to be naked as to clothing, than
being clad with the fruits of covetousness, to go about like them that
celebrate the orgies for Bacchus. For like as they have on
madmen’s masks and clothes, so have these also. And much as the
nakedness of the possessed is caused by madness, so doth madness
produce this clothing, and the clothing is more miserable than the
nakedness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p59">And this I will hereby endeavor to prove. For whom
should we say was more mad, amongst madmen themselves; one who should
cut himself, or one who together with himself should hurt those who met
him? It is quite clear that it is this last. The madmen then strip
themselves of their clothing, but these all that meet them. “But
these tear their clothes to pieces.” And how readily would every
one of those that are injured consent that his garment should be torn,
rather than be stripped of all his substance?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p60">“But those do not aim blows at the face.” In
the first place, the covetous do even this, and if not all, yet do all
inflict by famine and penury more grievous pains on the belly.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p61">“But those bite not with the teeth.” Would
that it were with teeth, and not with the darts of covetousness fiercer
than teeth. “For their teeth are weapons and darts.”<note n="2940" id="iii.LXXVII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p62"><scripRef passage="Ps. lvii. 4" id="iii.LXXVII-p62.1" parsed="|Ps|57|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.57.4">Ps. lvii.

healed, or he that is for ever eaten up by the teeth of penury? For
penury when involuntary is more grievous than furnace or wild
beast.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p63">“But those rush not into the deserts like the
possessed of devils.” Would it were the deserts, and not the
cities, that they overran, and so all in the cities enjoyed security.
For now in this respect again, they are more intolerable than all the
insane, because they do in the cities these things which the others do
in the deserts, making the cities deserts, and like as in a desert,
where there is none to hinder, so plundering the goods of all men.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p64">“But they do not pelt with stones them that meet
them.” And what is this? Of stones it were easy to beware; but of
the wounds which by paper and ink they work to the wretched poor
(framing writings full of blows without number), who, out of those that
fall in with them, can ever easily beware?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p65">4. And let us see also what they do to themselves. They
walk naked up and down the city, for they have no garment of virtue.
But if this doth not seem to them to be a disgrace, this again is of
their exceeding madness, for that they have no feeling of the
unseemliness, but while they are ashamed of having their body naked,
they bear about the soul naked, and glory in it. And if you wish, I
will tell you also the cause of their insensibility. What then is the
cause? They are naked amongst many that are thus naked, wherefore
neither are they ashamed, like as neither are we in the baths. So that
if indeed there were many clothed with virtue, then would their shame
appear more. But

<pb n="470" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_470.html" id="iii.LXXVII-Page_470" />

now this above
all is a worthy subject for many tears, that because the bad are many,
bad things are not even esteemed as a disgrace. For besides the rest,
the devil hath brought about this too, not to allow them to obtain even
a sense of their evil deeds, but by the multitude of them that practise
wickedness, to throw a shade over their disgrace; since if it came to
pass that he was in the midst of a multitude of persons practising
self-restraint, such a one would see his nakedness more.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p66">That they are more naked than the possessed is evident
from these things; and that they go into the deserts, neither this
again could any one gainsay. For the wide and broad way is more desert
than any desert. For though it have many that journey on it, yet none
from amongst men, but serpents, scorpions, wolves, adders, and asps.
Such are they that practise wickedness. And this way is not only
desert, but much more rugged than that <i>of the mad</i>. And this is
hereby evident. For stones and ravines and crags do not so wound those
that mount them, as robbery and covetousness the souls that practise
them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p67">And that they live by the tombs, like the possessed, or
rather that they themselves are tombs, is plain by this. What is a
tomb? A stone having a dead body lying in it. Wherein then do these
men’s bodies differ from those stones? or rather, they are more
miserable even than they. For it is not a stone containing a dead body,
but a body more insensible than stones, bearing about a dead soul.
Wherefore one would not be wrong in calling them tombs. For so did our
Lord too call the Jews, for this reason most especially; He went on at
least to say, “Their inward parts are full of ravening and
covetousness.”<note n="2941" id="iii.LXXVII-p67.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p68"><scripRef passage="Matt. 23.25,27" id="iii.LXXVII-p68.1" parsed="|Matt|23|25|0|0;|Matt|23|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.25 Bible:Matt.23.27">Matt. xxiii. 25, and comp. verse 27</scripRef>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p69">Would ye that I show next, how they also cut their heads
with stones? Whence then first, I pray thee, wilt thou learn this? From
the things here, or from the things to come? But of the things to come
they have not much regard; we must speak then of the things here. For
are not anxieties more grievous than many stones, not wounding heads,
but consuming a soul. For they are afraid, lest those things should
justly go forth out of their house, which have come unto them unjustly;
they tremble in fear of the utmost ills, are angry, are provoked,
against those of their own house, against strangers; and now
despondency, now fear, now wrath, comes upon them in succession, and
they are as if they were crossing precipice after precipice, and they
are earnestly looking day by day for what they have not yet acquired.
Wherefore neither do they feel pleasure in the things they have, both
by reason of not feeling confidence about the security of them, and
because with their whole mind they are intent upon what they have not
yet seized. And like as one continually thirsting, though he should
drink up ten thousand fountains, feeleth not the pleasure, because he
is not satisfied; so also these, so far from feeling pleasure, are even
tormented, the more they heap around themselves; from their not feeling
any limit to such desire.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p70">And things here are like this; but let us speak also of
the day to come. For though they give not heed, yet it is necessary for
us to speak. In the day to come then, one will see everywhere such men
as these undergoing punishment. For when He saith, “I was an
hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no
drink;”<note n="2942" id="iii.LXXVII-p70.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVII-p71"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 42" id="iii.LXXVII-p71.1" parsed="|Matt|25|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.42">Matt. xxv.

eternal fire prepared for the devil,” He is sending thither them
that make a bad use of riches. And the wicked servant, who gives not to

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p75">5. What then is the use of the right faith to us for
salvation, when we hear these things? There, gnashing of teeth, and
outer darkness, and the fire prepared for the devil, and to be cut
asunder, and to be driven away; here, enmities, evil speakings,
slanders, perils, cares, plots, to be hated of all, to be abhorred of
all, even of the very persons that seem to flatter us. For as good men
are admired not by the good only but even by the wicked; so bad men,
not the good only, but also the worthless, hate. And in proof that this
is true, I would gladly ask of the covetous, whether they do not feel
painfully one toward another; and account such more their enemies than
those that have done them the greatest wrong; whether they do not also
accuse themselves, whether they do not account the thing

<pb n="471" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_471.html" id="iii.LXXVII-Page_471" />

an affront, if any one brings this reproach
upon them. For indeed this is an extreme reproach, and a sure proof of
much wickedness; for if thou dost not endure to despise wealth, of what
wilt thou ever get the better? of lust, or of the mad desire of glory,
or anger, or of wrath? And how would any be persuaded of it? For as to
lust, and anger, and wrath, many impute it even to the temperament of
the flesh, and to this do students of medicine refer the excesses
thereof; and him that is of a more hot and languid temperament, they
affirm to be more lustful; but him that runs out into a drier kind of
ill temperament, eager, and irritable, and wrathful. But with respect
to covetousness, no one ever heard of their having said any such thing.
So entirely is the pest the effect of mere remissness, and of a soul
past feeling.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p76">Therefore, I beseech you, let us give diligence to amend
all such things, and to give an opposite direction to the passions that
come upon us in every age. But if in every part of our life we sail
past the labors of virtue, everywhere undergoing shipwrecks; when we
have arrived at the harbor destitute of spiritual freight, we shall
undergo extreme punishment. For our present life is an outstretched
ocean. And as in the sea here, there are different bays exposed to
different tempests, and the Ægean is difficult because of the
winds, the Tyrrhenian strait because of the confined space, the
Charybdis that is by Africa because of the shallows, the Propontis,
which is without the Euxine sea, on account of its violence and
currents, the parts without Cadiz because of the desolation, and
tracklessness, and unexplored places therein, and other portions for
other causes; so also is it in our life.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p77">And the first sea to view is that of our childish days,
having much tempestuousness, because of its folly, its facility,
because it is not steadfast. Therefore also we set over it guides and
teachers, by our diligence adding what is wanting to nature, even as
there by the pilot’s skill.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p78">After this age succeeds the sea of the youth, where the
winds are violent as in the Ægean, lust increasing upon us. And
this age especially is destitute of correction; not only because he is
beset more fiercely, but also because his faults are not reproved, for
both teacher and guide after that withdraw. When therefore the winds
blow more fiercely, and the pilot is more feeble, and there is no
helper, consider the greatness of the tempest.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p79">After this there is again another period of life, that
of men, in which the cares of the household press upon us, when there
is a wife, and marriage, and begetting of children, and ruling of a
house, and thick falling showers of cares. Then especially both
covetousness flourishes and envy.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p80">When then we pass each part of our life with shipwrecks,
how shall we suffice for the present life? how shall we escape future
punishment. For when first in the earliest age we learn nothing
healthful, and then in youth we do not practise sobriety, and when
grown to manhood do not get the better of covetousness, coming to old
age as to a hold full of bilgewater, and as having made the barque of
the soul weak by all these shocks, the planks being separated, we shall
arrive at that harbor, bearing much filth instead of spiritual
merchandise, and to the devil we shall furnish laughter, but
lamentation to ourselves, and bring upon ourselves the intolerable
punishments.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVII-p81">That these things may not be, let us brace ourselves up
on every side, and, withstanding all our passions, let us cast out the
lust of wealth, that we may also attain unto the good things to come,
by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

laughing to scorn the traitor’s shamelessness. For indeed his sin
became greater from both causes, as well in that he came to the
mysteries with such a disposition, as that having approached them, he
did not become better, either from fear, or from the benefit, or from
the honor. But Christ forbad him not, although He knew all things, that
thou mightest learn that He omits none of the things that pertain to
correction. Wherefore both before this, and after this, He continually
admonished him, and checked him, both by deeds, and by words; both by
fear, and by kindness; both by threatening, and by honor. But none of
these things withdrew him from that grievous pest.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p10">Wherefore thenceforth He leaves him, and by the
mysteries again reminds the disciples of His being slain, and in the
midst of the meal His discourse is of the cross, by the continual
repeating of the prediction, making His passion easy to receive. For
if, when so many things had been done and foretold, they were troubled;
if they had heard none of these things, what would they not have
felt?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p11">“And as they were eating, He took bread, and brake
it.” Why can it have been that He ordained this sacrament then,
at the time of the passover? That thou mightest learn from everything,
both that He is the lawgiver of the Old Testament, and that the things
therein are foreshadowed because of these things. Therefore, I say,
where the type is, there He puts the truth.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p12">But the evening is a sure sign of the fullness of times,
and that the things were now come to the very end.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p13">And He gives thanks, to teach us how we ought to
celebrate this sacrament, and to show that not unwillingly doth He come
to the passion, and to teach us whatever we may suffer to bear it
thankfully, thence also suggesting good hopes. For if the type was a
deliverance from such bondage, how much more will the truth set free
the world, and will He be delivered up for the benefit of our race.
Wherefore, I would add, neither did He appoint the sacrament before
this, but when henceforth the rites of the law were to cease. And thus
the very chief of the feasts He brings to an end, removing them to
another most awful table, and He saith, “Take, eat, This is my
body, Which is broken for many.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p14">And how were they not confounded at hearing this?
Because He had before told unto them many and great things touching
this. Wherefore that He establishes no more, for they had heard it
sufficiently, but he speaks of the cause of His passion, namely, the
taking away of sins. And He calls it blood of a New Testament, that of
the undertaking, the promise, the new law. For this He undertook also
of old, and this comprises the Testament that is in the new law. And
like as the Old Testament had sheep and bullocks, so this has the
Lord’s blood. Hence also He shows that He is soon to die,
wherefore also He made mention of a Testament, and He reminds them also
of the former Testament, for that also was dedicated with blood. And
again He tells the cause of His death, “which is shed for many
for the remission of

<pb n="473" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_473.html" id="iii.LXXVIII-Page_473" />

sins;”
and He saith, “Do this in remembrance of me.” Seest thou
how He removes and draws them off from Jewish customs. For like as ye
did that, He saith, in remembrance of the miracles in Egypt, so do this
likewise in remembrance of me. That was shed for the preservation of
the firstborn, this for the remission of the sins of the whole world.
For, “This,” saith He, “is my blood, which is shed
for the remission of sins.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p15">But this He said, indicating thereby, that His passion
and His cross are a mystery, by this too again comforting His
disciples. And like as Moses saith, “This shall be to you for an
everlasting memorial,”<note n="2949" id="iii.LXXVIII-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p16"><scripRef passage="Exod. xii. 14" id="iii.LXXVIII-p16.1" parsed="|Exod|12|14|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.12.14">Exod. xii.

xi. 26</scripRef>, and St. Chrys. on the
place, Hom. XXVII. on 1 Cor., where he attributes the words
“until He come,” expressly to St. Paul. Various early
writers attribute them to our Lord.</p></note> Therefore also He saith, “With desire I have desired to eat this
passover,”<note n="2951" id="iii.LXXVIII-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p18"><scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 15" id="iii.LXXVIII-p18.1" parsed="|Luke|22|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.15">Luke xxii.

I am to make you spiritual.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p19">And He Himself drank of it. For lest on hearing this,
they should say, What then? do we drink blood, and eat flesh? and then
be perplexed (for when He began to discourse concerning these things,
even at the very sayings many were offended),<note n="2952" id="iii.LXXVIII-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p20"><scripRef passage="John vi. 60, 61, 66" id="iii.LXXVIII-p20.1" parsed="|John|6|60|6|61;|John|6|66|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.6.60-John.6.61 Bible:John.6.66">John vi.
60, 61, 66</scripRef>.</p></note>therefore lest they should be troubled then likewise, He first did this
Himself, leading them to the calm participation of the mysteries.
Therefore He Himself drank His own blood. What then must we observe
that other ancient rite also? some one may say. By no means. For on
this account He said, “Do this,” that He might withdraw
them from the other. For if this worketh remission of sins, as it
surely doth work it, the other is now superfluous.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p21">As then in the case of the Jews, so here also He hath
bound up the memorial of the benefit with the mystery, by this again
stopping the mouths of heretics. For when they say, Whence is it
manifest that Christ was sacrificed? together with the other arguments
we stop their mouths from the mysteries also. For if Jesus did not die,
of what are the rites the symbols?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p22">2. Seest thou how much diligence hath been used, that it
should be ever borne in mind that He died for us? For since the
Marcionists, and Valentinians, and Manichæans were to arise,
denying this dispensation, He continually reminds us of the passion
even by the mysteries, (so that no man should be deceived); at once
saving, and at the same time teaching by means of that sacred table.
For this is the chief of the blessings; wherefore Paul also is in every
way pressing this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p23">Then, when He had delivered it, He saith, “I will
not drink of the fruit of this wine, until that day when I drink it new
with you in my Father’s kingdom.”<note n="2953" id="iii.LXXVIII-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 29" id="iii.LXXVIII-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|26|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.29">Matt. xxvi.

“henceforth” is omitted; “this” is joined with
“vine,” and “new” is in a different position in
the Greek. All these are variations from the received text, which is
also followed in the R.V.—R.]</p></note> For because He had discoursed with them concerning passion and cross,
He again introduces what He has to say of His resurrection, having made
mention of a kingdom before them,<note n="2954" id="iii.LXXVIII-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p25"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXVIII-p25.1">ε

and end with an hymn.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p26">Hear this, as many as wait not again for the last prayer
of the mysteries, for this is a

symbol of that. He gave thanks before He gave
it to His disciples, that we also may give thanks. He gave thanks, and
sang an hymn after the giving, that we also may do this selfsame
thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p27">But for what reason doth He go forth unto the mountain?
Making Himself manifest, that He may be taken, in order not to seem to
hide himself. For He hastened to go to the place which was also known
to Judas.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p28">Then “He saith unto them, All ye shall be offended

written, and at same time making it plain that He was crucified,
according to God’s purpose; and by everything showing He was no
alien from the old covenant, nor from the God preached therein, but
that what is done is a dispensation,<note n="2957" id="iii.LXXVIII-p30.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p31"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXVIII-p31.1">οκονομα</span>.</p></note>and that the prophets all proclaimed all things beforehand from the
beginning that are comprised in the matter, so that they be quite
confident about the better things also.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p32">And He teaches us to know what the disciples were before
the crucifixion, what after the crucifixion. For indeed they who, when
He was crucified, were not able so much as to stand their ground, these
after His death were mighty, and stronger than adamant.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p33">And this self-same thing is a demonstration of His
death, the fright and cowardice, I mean, of His disciples. For if when
so many things have been both done and said, still some are shameless,
and say that He was not crucified; if none of these things had come to
pass, to what pitch of wickedness would they not have proceeded? So for
this reason, not by His own sufferings only, but by what took place
with respect to the disciples, He confirms the word concerning His
death, and by the mysteries also, in every way confounding those that
are diseased with the pest of Marcion. For this reason He suffers even
the chief apostle to deny Him. But if He was not bound nor crucified,
whence sprung the fear to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p34">He suffers them not however, on the other hand, to wait
until the sorrows, but what saith He? “But after I am risen
again, I will go before you into Galilee.”<note n="2958" id="iii.LXXVIII-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p35"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 32" id="iii.LXXVIII-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|26|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.32">Matt. xxvi.

up.”]</p></note> For not from Heaven doth He appear at once, neither will He depart into
any distant country, but in the same nation, in which He had also been
crucified, nearly in the same place, so as hereby again to assure them
that He that was crucified was the very same that rose again, and in
this way to comfort them more abundantly when in sorrow. Therefore also
He said “in Galilee,” that being freed from the fears of
the Jews they might believe His saying. For which cause indeed He
appeared there.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p36">“But Peter answered and said, Though all men
should be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be
offended.”<note n="2959" id="iii.LXXVIII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p37"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 33" id="iii.LXXVIII-p37.1" parsed="|Matt|26|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.33">Matt. xxvi.

teaching him thereby to believe Christ in all things, and to account
His declaration more trustworthy than one’s own conscience. And
the rest too reaped no small benefit from his denial, having come to
know man’s weakness, and God’ s truth. For when He
foretells anything, we must no longer be subtle, nor lift up ourselves
above the common sort. For, “thy rejoicing,” it is said,
“thou shalt have in thyself, and not in another.”<note n="2961" id="iii.LXXVIII-p39.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p40"><scripRef passage="Gal. vi. 4" id="iii.LXXVIII-p40.1" parsed="|Gal|6|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.4">Gal. vi.

cut off, he is confident in himself, and saith, “Though all men
should be offended in Thee, yet will I never;” though all should
undergo this, I shall not undergo it, which led him on by little and
little to self-confidence. Christ then, out of a desire to put down
this, permitted his denial. For since he neither submitted to Him nor
the prophet (and yet for this intent He brought in the prophet besides,
that they may not gainsay), but nevertheless since he submitted not to
His words, he is instructed by deeds.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p41">For in proof that for this intent He permitted it, that

blame were two; both that he gainsaid; and, that he set himself before
the other; or rather a third too, namely, that he attributed all to
himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p43">To cure these things then, He suffered the fall to take
place, and for this cause also

<pb n="475" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_475.html" id="iii.LXXVIII-Page_475" />

leaves the others, and addresses Himself
earnestly to him. For, “Simon,”<note n="2963" id="iii.LXXVIII-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p44"><scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 31" id="iii.LXXVIII-p44.1" parsed="|Luke|22|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.31">Luke xxii.
31</scripRef>. [R.V., “Satan
asked;” margin, “Or, obtained you by asking.”]</p></note>saith He, “Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you that he
may sift you as wheat;” that is, that he may trouble, confound,
tempt you; but “I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
not.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p45">And why, if Satan desired all, did He not say concerning
all, I have prayed for you? Is it not quite plain that it is this,
which I have mentioned before, that it is as reproving him, and showing
that his fall was more grievous than the rest, that He directs His
words to him?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p46">And wherefore said He not, But I did not suffer it,
rather than, “I have prayed?” He speaks from this time
lowly things, on His way to His passion, that He may show His humanity.
For He that has built His church upon Peter’s confession, and has
so fortified it, that ten thousand dangers and deaths are not to
prevail over it; He that hath given him the keys of Heaven, and hath
put him in possession of so much authority, and in no manner needed a
prayer for these ends (for neither did He say, I have prayed, but with
His own authority, “I will build my church, and I will give thee
the keys of Heaven”), how should He need to pray, that He might
brace up the shaken soul of a single man? Wherefore then did He speak
in this way? For the cause which I mentioned, and because of their
weakness, for they had not as yet the becoming view of Him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p47">How then was it that He denied? he said not, that thou
mayest not deny, but that thy faith fail not, that thou perish not
utterly. For this came from His care.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p48">For indeed fear had driven out all else, for it was
beyond measure, and it became beyond measure, since God had to an
exceeding degree deprived him of His help, and He did exceedingly
deprive him thereof, because there was to an exceeding degree in him
the passion of self-will and contradiction. In order then that He might
pluck it up by the roots, therefore He suffered the terror to overtake
him.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p49">For in proof that this passion was grievous in him, he
was not content with his former words, gainsaying both prophet and
Christ, but also after these things when Christ had said unto him,
“Verily I say unto thee, that this night,<note n="2964" id="iii.LXXVIII-p49.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p50">[The preposition <span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXVIII-p50.1">ἐν</span> is omitted from the Greek text.—R.]</p></note>before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice,” he replieth,
“Though I should die with Thee, I will not deny Thee in any
wise.”<note n="2965" id="iii.LXXVIII-p50.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p51"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 34, 35" id="iii.LXXVIII-p51.1" parsed="|Matt|26|34|26|35" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.34-Matt.26.35">Matt. xxvi.
34, 35</scripRef>. [R.V., “If I
must die with thee, <i>yet</i> will I not deny thee.”]</p></note> And Luke signifies moreover, that the more Christ warned him, so much
the more did Peter exceedingly oppose Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p52">What mean these things, O Peter? When He was saying,
“One of you shall betray me,” thou didst fear lest thou
shouldest be the traitor, and didst constrain the disciple to ask,
although conscious to thyself of no such thing; but now, when He is
plainly crying out, and saying, “All shall be offended,”
art thou gainsaying it, and not once only, but twice and often? For
this is what Luke saith.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p53">Whence then did this come to him? From much love, from
much pleasure. I mean, that after that he was delivered from that
distressing fear about the betrayal, and knew the traitor, he then
spoke confidently, and lifted himself up over the rest, saying,
“Though all men shall be offended, yet will I not be
offended.”<note n="2966" id="iii.LXXVIII-p53.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p54"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 33" id="iii.LXXVIII-p54.1" parsed="|Matt|26|33|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.33">Matt. xxvi.
33</scripRef>. [Slightly changed.]</p></note> And in some degree too his conduct sprung from jealousy, for at supper
they reasoned “which of them is the greater,”<note n="2967" id="iii.LXXVIII-p54.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p55"><scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 24" id="iii.LXXVIII-p55.1" parsed="|Luke|22|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.24">Luke xxii.
24</scripRef>.</p></note>to such a degree did this passion trouble them. Therefore He checked
him, not compelling him to the denial, God forbid! but leaving him
destitute of His help, and convicting human nature.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p56">See at any rate after these things how he was subdued.
For after the resurrection, when he had said, “And what shall
this man do?”<note n="2968" id="iii.LXXVIII-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p57"><scripRef passage="John xxi. 21" id="iii.LXXVIII-p57.1" parsed="|John|21|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.21.21">John xxi.
21</scripRef>.</p></note>and was silenced, he ventured no more to gainsay as here, but held his
peace. Again, towards the assumption,<note n="2969" id="iii.LXXVIII-p57.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p58"><i>i.e</i>., the Ascension.</p></note>when he heard, “It is not for you to know times or
seasons,”<note n="2970" id="iii.LXXVIII-p58.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p59"><scripRef passage="Acts i. 7" id="iii.LXXVIII-p59.1" parsed="|Acts|1|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.1.7">Acts i.
7</scripRef>.</p></note>again he holds his peace, and contradicts not. After these things, on
the house, and by the sheet, when he heard a voice saying to him,
“What God hath cleansed, call not thou common,”<note n="2971" id="iii.LXXVIII-p59.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p60"><scripRef passage="Acts x. 15" id="iii.LXXVIII-p60.1" parsed="|Acts|10|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.10.15">Acts x.
15</scripRef>.</p></note>even though he knew not for the time what the saying could be, he is
quiet, and strives not.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p61">4. All these things did that fall effect, and whereas
before that he attributes all to himself, saying, “Though all men
shall be offended, yet will I not be offended;” and, “If I
should die, I will not deny Thee” (when he should have said, If I
receive the assistance from Thee);—yet after these things
altogether the contrary, “Why do ye give heed to us, as though by
our own power or holiness we had made him to walk?”<note n="2972" id="iii.LXXVIII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p62"><scripRef passage="Acts iii. 12" id="iii.LXXVIII-p62.1" parsed="|Acts|3|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.3.12">Acts iii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p63">Hence we learn a great doctrine, that a man’s
willingness is not sufficient, unless any one receive the succor from
above; and that again we shall gain nothing by the succor

<pb n="476" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_476.html" id="iii.LXXVIII-Page_476" />

from above, if there be not a willingness. And
both these things do Judas and Peter show; for the one, though he had
received much help, was profited nothing, because he was not willing,
neither contributed his part; but this one, though he was ready in
mind, because he received no assistance, fell. For indeed of these two
things is virtue’s web woven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p64">Wherefore I entreat you neither (when you have cast all
upon God) to sleep yourselves, nor, when laboring earnestly, to think
to accomplish all by your own toils. For neither is it God’s will
that we should be supine ourselves, therefore He worketh it not all
Himself; nor yet boasters, therefore He did not give all to us; but
having removed what was hurtful in either way, left that which is
useful for us. Therefore He suffered even the chief apostle to fall,
both rendering him more humbled in mind, and training him thenceforth
to greater love. “For to whom more is forgiven,” it is
said, “he loveth more.”<note n="2973" id="iii.LXXVIII-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p65"><scripRef passage="Luke vii. 47" id="iii.LXXVIII-p65.1" parsed="|Luke|7|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.7.47">Luke vii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p66">Let us then in everything believe God, and gainsay Him
in nothing, though what is said seem to be contrary to our thoughts and
senses, but let His word be of higher authority than both reasonings
and sight. Thus let us do in the mysteries also, not looking at the
things set before us, but keeping in mind His sayings.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p67">For His word cannot deceive, but our senses are easily
beguiled. That hath never failed, but this in most things goeth wrong.
Since then the word saith, “This is my body,” let us both
be persuaded and believe, and look at it with the eyes of the mind.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p68">For Christ hath given nothing sensible, but though in
things sensible yet all to be perceived by the mind. So also in
baptism, the gift is bestowed by a sensible thing, that is, by water;
but that which is done is perceived by the mind, the birth, I mean, and
the renewal. For if thou hadst been incorporeal, He would have
delivered thee the incorporeal gifts bare; but because the soul hath
been locked up in a body, He delivers thee the things that the mind
perceives, in things sensible.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p69">How many now say, I would wish to see His form, the
mark, His clothes, His shoes. Lo! thou seest Him, Thou touchest Him,
thou eatest Him. And thou indeed desirest to see His clothes, but He
giveth Himself to thee not to see only, but also to touch and eat and
receive within thee.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p70">Let then no one approach it with indifference, no one
faint-hearted, but all with burning hearts, all fervent, all aroused.
For if Jews standing, and having on their shoes and their staves in
their hands, ate with haste, much more oughtest thou to be watchful.
For they indeed were to go forth to Palestine, wherefore also they had
the garb of pilgrims, but thou art about to remove unto Heaven.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p71">5. Wherefore it is needful in all respects to be
vigilant, for indeed no small punishment is appointed to them that
partake unworthily.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p72">Consider how indignant thou art against the traitor,
against them that crucified Him. Look therefore, lest thou also thyself
become guilty of the body and blood of Christ. They slaughtered the
all-holy body, but thou receivest it in a filthy soul after such great
benefits. For neither was it enough for Him to be made man, to be
smitten and slaughtered, but He also commingleth Himself with us, and
not by faith only, but also in very deed maketh us His body. What then
ought not he to exceed in purity that hath the benefit of this
sacrifice, than what sunbeam should not that hand be more pure which is
to sever this flesh, the mouth that is filled with spiritual fire, the
tongue that is reddened by that most awful blood? Consider with what
sort of honor thou wast honored, of what sort of table thou art
partaking. That which when angels behold, they tremble, and dare not so
much as look up at it without awe on account of the brightness that
cometh thence, with this we are fed, with this we are commingled, and
we are made one body and one flesh with Christ. “Who shall
declare the mighty works of the Lord, and cause all His praises to be
heard?”<note n="2974" id="iii.LXXVIII-p72.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p73"><scripRef passage="Ps. cvi. 2" id="iii.LXXVIII-p73.1" parsed="|Ps|6|2|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Ps.6.2">Ps. cvi.

shepherd? There are often mothers that after the travail of birth send
out their children to other women as nurses; but He endureth not to do
this, but Himself feeds us with His own blood, and by all means
entwines us with Himself.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p74">Mark it, He was born of our substance. But, you say,
this is nothing to all men; though it does concern all. For if He came
unto our nature, it is quite plain that it was to all; but if to all,
then to each one. And how was it, you say, that all did not reap the
profit therefrom. This was not of His doing, whose choice it was to do
this in behalf of all, but the fault of them that were not willing.
With each one of the faithful doth He mingle Himself in the mysteries,
and whom He begat, He nourishes by Himself, and

<pb n="477" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_477.html" id="iii.LXXVIII-Page_477" />

putteth not out to another; by this also
persuading thee again, that He had taken thy flesh. Let us not then be
remiss, having been counted worthy of so much both of love and honor.
See ye not the infants with how much eagerness they lay hold of the
breast? with what earnest desire they fix their lips upon the nipple?
With the like let us also approach this table, and the nipple of the
spiritual cup. Or rather, with much more eagerness let us, as infants
at the breast, draw out the grace of the spirit, let it be our one
sorrow, not to partake of this food. The works set before us are not of
man’s power. He that then did these things at that supper, this
same now also works them. We occupy the place of servants. He who
sanctifieth and changeth them is the same. Let then no Judas be
present, no covetous man. If any one be not a disciple, let him
withdraw, the table receives not such. For “I keep the
passover,” He saith, “with my disciples.”<note n="2975" id="iii.LXXVIII-p74.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXVIII-p75"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 18" id="iii.LXXVIII-p75.1" parsed="|Matt|26|18|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.18">Matt. xxvi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p76">This table is the same as that, and hath nothing less.
For it is not so that Christ wrought that, and man this, but He doth
this too. This is that upper chamber, where they were then; and hence
they went forth unto the mount of Olives.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p77">Let us also go out unto the hands of the poor, for this
spot is the mount of Olives. For the multitude of the poor are
olive-trees planted in the house of God, dropping the oil, which is
profitable for us there, which the five virgins had, and the others
that had not received perished thereby. Having received this, let us
enter in that with bright lamps we may meet the bridegroom; having
received this, let us go forth hence.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXVIII-p78">Let no inhuman person be present, no one that is cruel
and merciless, no one at all that is unclean.</p>

that minister. For it is necessary to address myself to you also, that

cause again, even that the heretics might not say this, that He acts
the agony. Therefore there is a sweat like drops of blood, and an angel
appeared strengthening Him, and a thousand sure signs of fear, lest any
one should affirm the words to be feigned. For this cause also was this
prayer. By saying then, “If it be possible, let it pass from
me,” He showed His humanity; but by saying, “Nevertheless
not as I will, but as Thou wilt,” He showed His virtue and
self-command, teaching us even when nature pulls us back, to follow
God. For since it was not enough for the foolish to show His face only,
He uses words also. Again, words sufficed not alone, but deeds likewise
were needed; these also He joins with the words, that even they who are
in a high degree contentious may believe, that He both became man and
died. For if, even when these things are so, this be still disbelieved
by some, much more, if these had not been. See by how many things He
shows the reality of the incarnation: by what He speaks, by what He
suffers. After that He cometh and saith to Peter, as it is said,
“What, couldest thou not watch one hour with me?”<note n="2982" id="iii.LXXIX-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p11">Comp. <scripRef passage="Mark xiv. 37" id="iii.LXXIX-p11.1" parsed="|Mark|14|37|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.14.37">Mark

bukes
Peter, hinting at him, in what He spake. And the words, “with
me,” are not employed without reason; it is as though He had
said, Thou couldest not watch with me one hour, and wilt thou lay down
thy life for me? and what follows also, intimates this self-same thing.
For “Watch,” saith He, “and pray not to enter into
temptation.” See how He is again instructing them not to be
self-confident, but contrite in mind, and to be humble, and to refer
all to God.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p12">And at one time He addresses Himself to Peter, at
another to all in common. And to him He saith, “Simon, Simon,
Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I
have prayed for thee;” and to all in common, “Pray that ye
enter not into temptation;” every way plucking up their
self-will, and making them earnest-minded. Then, that He might not seem
to make His language altogether condemnatory, He saith, “The
spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak.” For even although
thou dost desire to despise death, yet thou wilt not be able, until God
stretch forth His hand, for the carnal mind draws down.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p13">And again He prayed in the same way, saying,
“Father, if this cannot pass from me except I drink it, Thy will
be done,”<note n="2983" id="iii.LXXIX-p13.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p14"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 42" id="iii.LXXIX-p14.1" parsed="|Matt|26|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.42">Matt. xxvi.

we must always follow this, and seek after it.</p>

down by their despondency. And the third time He went and spake the
same thing, establishing the fact, that He was become man. For the
second and third time is in the Scriptures especially indicative of
truth; like as Joseph also said to Pharaoh, “Did the dream appear
to thee the second time? For truth was this done, and that thou
mightest be assured that this shall surely be.”<note n="2985" id="iii.LXXIX-p16.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p17"><scripRef passage="Gen. xli. 32" id="iii.LXXIX-p17.1" parsed="|Gen|41|32|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.41.32">Gen. xli.

for the sake of proving the incarnation.<note n="2986" id="iii.LXXIX-p17.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p18"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXIX-p18.1">οκονομα</span>.</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p19">And wherefore came He the second time? In order to
reprove them, for that they were so drowned in despondency, as not to
have any sense even of His presence. He did not however reprove them,
but stood apart from them a little, showing their unspeakable weakness,
that not even when they had been rebuked, were they able to endure. But
He doth not awake and rebuke them again, lest He should smite them that
were already smitten, but He went away and prayed, and when He is come
back again, He saith, “Sleep on now, and take your rest.”
And yet then there was need to be wakeful, but to show that they will
not bear so much as the sight of the dangers, but will be put to flight
and desert Him from their terror, and that He hath no need of their
succor, and that He must by all means be delivered up, “Sleep on
now,” He saith, “and take your rest; behold the hour is at
hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners.”<note n="2987" id="iii.LXXIX-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 45" id="iii.LXXIX-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|26|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.45">Matt. xxvi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p21">He shows again that what is done belongs to a divine
dispensation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p22">2. But He doth not this only, but also, by saying,
“into the hands of sinners,” He cheers up their minds,
showing it was the effect of their wickedness, not of His being liable
to any charge.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p23">“Rise, let us be going; behold, he is at hand that
doth betray me.”<note n="2988" id="iii.LXXIX-p23.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p24"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 46" id="iii.LXXIX-p24.1" parsed="|Matt|26|46|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.46">Matt. xxvi.
46</scripRef>.</p></note> For by all means He taught them, that the matter was not of necessity,
nor of weakness, but of some secret dispensation. For, as we see, He
foreknew that Judas would come, and so far from flying, He even went to
meet him. At any rate, “While He yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the
twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,
from the chief priests and elders of the people.”<note n="2989" id="iii.LXXIX-p24.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p25"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 47" id="iii.LXXIX-p25.1" parsed="|Matt|26|47|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.47">Matt. xxvi.

them, one of the twelve. Again he calleth him “of the

sign, saying, “Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He, hold Him
fast.”<note n="2990" id="iii.LXXIX-p25.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p26"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 48" id="iii.LXXIX-p26.1" parsed="|Matt|26|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.48">Matt. xxvi.

kind of eyes did he then look at his Master? with what mouth did he
kiss Him? Oh! accursed purpose; what did he devise? What did he dare?
What sort of sign of betrayal did he give? Whomsoever I shall kiss, he
saith. He was emboldened by his Master’s gentleness, which more
than all was sufficient to shame him, and to deprive him of all excuse
for that he was betraying one so meek.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p27">But wherefore doth He say this? Because often when
seized by them He had gone out through the midst, without their knowing
it. Nevertheless, then also this would have been done, if it had not
been His own will that He should be taken. It was at least with a view
to teach them this, that He then blinded their eyes, and Himself asked,
“Whom seek ye?”<note n="2991" id="iii.LXXIX-p27.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p28"><scripRef passage="John xviii. 4" id="iii.LXXIX-p28.1" parsed="|John|18|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.4">John xviii.

“I am He” whom ye seek: and here again, “Friend,

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p30">For after having shown His own strength, then at once He
yielded Himself. But John saith, that even to the very moment He
continued to reprove him, saying, “Judas, betrayest thou the Son
of Man with a kiss?”<note n="2993" id="iii.LXXIX-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p31"><scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 48" id="iii.LXXIX-p31.1" parsed="|Luke|22|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.48">Luke xxii.
48</scripRef>.</p></note> Art thou not ashamed even of the form of the betrayal? saith He.
Nevertheless, forasmuch as not even this checked him, He submitted to
be kissed, and gave Himself up willingly; and they laid their hands on
Him, and seized Him that night on which they ate the passover, to such
a degree did they boil with rage, and were mad. However, they would
have had no strength, unless He had Himself suffered it. Yet this
delivers not Judas from intolerable punishment, but even more
exceedingly condemns him, for that though he had received such proof of
His power, and lenity, and meekness, and gentleness, he became fiercer
than any wild beast.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p32">Knowing then these things, let us flee from
covetousness. For that, that it was, which then drove him to madness;
that exercises them who are taken thereby in the most extreme cruelty
and inhumanity. For, when it makes them to despair of their own
salvation, much more doth it cause them to overlook that of the rest of
mankind. And so tyrannical is the passing, as sometimes to prevail over
the keenest lust. Wherefore indeed I am exceedingly ashamed, that to
spare their money, may indeed have bridled their unchastity, but for
the fear of Christ they were not willing to live chastely and with
gravity.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p33">Wherefore I say, let us flee from it; for I will not
cease for ever saying this. For why, O man, dost thou gather gold? Why
dost thou make thy bondage more bitter? Why thy watching more grievous?
Why thy anxiety more painful? Account for thine own the metals buried
in the mines, those in the kings’ courts. For indeed if thou
hadst all that heap, thou wouldest keep it only, and wouldest not use
it. For if now thou hast not used the things thou possessest, but
abstainest from them as though they belonged to others, much more would
this be the case with thee, if thou hadst more. For it is the way of
the covetous, the more they heap up around them, the more to be sparing
of it. “But I know,” sayest thou, “that these things
are mine.” The possession then is in supposition only, not in
enjoyment. But I should be an object of fear to men, sayest thou. Nay,
but thou wouldest by this become a more easy prey both to rich and
poor, to robbers, and false accusers, and servants, and in general to
all that are minded to plot against thee. For if thou art desirous to
be an object of fear, cut off the occasions by which they are able to
lay hold of thee and pain thee, whoever have set their hearts thereon.
Hearest thou not the parable that saith, that the poor and naked man,
not even a hundred men gathered together are ever able to strip? For he
hath his poverty as his greatest protection, which not even the king
shall ever be able to subdue and take.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p34">3. The covetous man indeed all join in vexing. And why
do I say men, when moths and worms war against such a man? And why do I
speak of moths? Length of time is enough alone, even when no one
troubles him, to do the greatest injury to such a man.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p35">What then is the pleasure of wealth? For I see its
discomforts, but do thou tell me the pleasure of it. And what are its
discomforts? sayest thou: anxieties, plots, enmities, hatred, fear; to
be ever thirsting and in pain.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p36">For if any one were to embrace a damsel he loves, but
were not able to satisfy his desire, he undergoes the utmost torment.
Even so also doth the rich man. For he hath plenty, and is with her,
but cannot satisfy all his desire; but the same result takes place as
some wise man mentions; “The lust of eunuch to deflower a
virgin;” and, “Like an eunuch embracing a virgin and
groaning;”<note n="2994" id="iii.LXXIX-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p37"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 20.4; 30.20" id="iii.LXXIX-p37.1" parsed="|Sir|20|4|0|0;|Sir|30|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.20.4 Bible:Sir.30.20">Ecclus. xx. 4, xxx.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p38">Why should one speak of the other things? how such a one
is displeasing to all, to his servants, his laborers, his neighbors, to
them that handle public affairs, to them that are injured, to them that
are not injured, to his wife most of all, and to his children more than
to any. For not as men does he bring them up, but more miserably than
menials and purchased slaves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p39">And countless occasions for anger, and vexation, and
insult, and ridicule against himself, doth he bring about, being set
forth as a common laughing stock to all. So the discomforts are these,
and perhaps more than these; before one could never go through them all
in discourse, but experience will be able to set them before us.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p40">But tell me the pleasure from hence. “I appear to
be rich,” he saith, “and am reputed to be rich.” And
what kind of pleas

<pb n="481" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_481.html" id="iii.LXXIX-Page_481" />

ure to be so
reputed? It is a very great name for envy. I say a name, for wealth is
a name only void of reality.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p41">“Yet he that is rich,” saith he,
“indulges and delights himself with this notion.” He
delights himself in those things about which he ought to grieve.
“To grieve? wherefore?” asks he. Because this renders him
useless for all purposes, and cowardly and unmanly both with regard to
banishment and to death, for he holds this double, longing more for
money than for light. Such a one not even Heaven delights, because it
beareth not gold; nor the sun, forasmuch as it puts not forth golden
beams.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p42">But there are some, saith he, who do enjoy what they
possess, living in luxury, in gluttony, in drunkenness, spending
sumptuously. You are telling me of persons worse than the first. For
the last above all are the men, who have no enjoyment. For the first at
least abstains from other evils, being bound to one love; but the
others are worse than these, besides what we have said, bringing in
upon themselves a crowd of cruel masters, and doing service every day
to the belly, to lust, to drunkenness, to other kinds of intemperance,
as to so many cruel tyrants, keeping harlots, preparing expensive
feasts, purchasing parasites, flatterers, turning aside after unnatural
lusts, involving their body and their soul in a thousand diseases
springing therefrom.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p43">For neither is it on what they want they spend their
goods, but on ruining the body, and on ruining also the soul therewith;
and they do the same, as if any one, when adorning his person, were to
think he was spending his money on his own wants.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p44">So that he alone enjoys pleasure and is master of his
goods, who uses his wealth for a proper object; but these are slaves
and captives, for they aggravate both the passions of the body and the
diseases of the soul. What manner of enjoyment is this, where is siege
and war, and a storm worse than all the raging of the sea? For if
wealth find men fools, it renders them more foolish; if wanton, more
wanton.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p45">And what is the use of understanding, thou wilt say, to
the poor man? As might be expected thou art ignorant; for neither doth
the blind man know what is the advantage of light. Listen to Solomon,
saying, “As far as light excelleth darkness, so doth wisdom excel
folly.”<note n="2995" id="iii.LXXIX-p45.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p46"><scripRef passage="Eccles. ii. 13" id="iii.LXXIX-p46.1" parsed="|Eccl|2|13|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Eccl.2.13">Eccles. ii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p47">But how shall we instruct him that is in darkness? For
the love of money is darkness, permitting nothing that is to appear as
it is, but otherwise. For much as one in darkness, though he should see
a golden vessel, though a precious stone, though purple garments,
supposes them to be nothing, for he sees not their beauty; so also he
that is in covetousness, knows not as he ought the beauty of those
things that are worthy of our care. Disperse then I pray thee the mist
that arises from this passion, and then wilt thou see the nature of
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p48">But nowhere do these things so plainly appear as in
poverty, nowhere are those things so disproved which seem to be, and
are not, as in self-denial.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p49">4. But oh! foolish men; who do even curse the poor, and
say that both houses and living are disgraced by poverty, confounding
all things. For what is a disgrace to a house? I pray thee. It hath no
couch of ivory, nor silver vessels, but all of earthenware and wood.
Nay, this is the greatest glory and distinction to a house. For to be
indifferent about worldly things, often occasions all a man’s
leisure to be spent in the care of his soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p50">When therefore thou seest great care about outward
things, then be ashamed at the great unseemliness. For the houses of
them that are rich most of all want seemliness. For when thou seest
tables covered with hangings, and couches inlaid with silver, much as
in the theatre, much as in the display of the stage, what can be equal
to this unseemliness? For what kind of house is most like the stage,
and the things on the stage? The rich man’s or the poor
man’s? Is it not quite plain that it is the rich man’s?
This therefore is full of unseemliness. What kind of house is most like
Paul’s, or Abraham’s? It is quite evident that it is the
poor man’s. This therefore is most adorned, and to be approved.
And that thou mayest learn that this is, above all, a house’s
adorning, enter into the house of Zacchæus, and learn, when Christ
was on the point of entering therein, how Zacchæus adorned it. For
he did not run to his neighbors begging curtains, and seats, and chairs
made of ivory, neither did he bring forth from his closets Laconian
hangings; but he adorned it with an adorning suitable to Christ. What
was this? “The half of my goods I will give,” he saith,
“to the poor; and whomsoever I have robbed, I will restore
fourfold.”<note n="2996" id="iii.LXXIX-p50.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXIX-p51"><scripRef passage="Luke xix. 8" id="iii.LXXIX-p51.1" parsed="|Luke|19|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.19.8">Luke xix.
8</scripRef>. [Altered, as in previous
citations.—R.]</p></note> On this wise let us too adorn our houses, that Christ may enter in unto
us also. These are the fair curtains, these are wrought in Heaven, they
are woven there. Where these are, there is also the King of Heaven. But
if thou

<pb n="482" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_482.html" id="iii.LXXIX-Page_482" />

adorn it in another way,
thou art inviting the devil and his company.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p52">He came also into the house of the publican Matthew.
What then did this man also do? He first adorned himself by his
readiness, and by his leaving all, and following Christ.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p53">So also Cornelius adorned his house with prayers and
alms; wherefore even unto this day it shines above the very palace. For
the vile state of a house is not in vessels lying in disorder, nor in
an untidy bed, nor in walls covered with smoke, but in the wickedness
of them that dwell therein. And Christ showeth it, for into such a
house, if the inhabitant be virtuous, He is not ashamed to enter; but
into that other, though it have a golden roof, He will never enter. So
that while this one is more gorgeous than the palace, receiving the
Lord of all, that with its golden roof and columns is like filthy
drains and sewers, for it contains the vessels of the devil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p54">But these things we have spoken not of those who are
rich for a useful purpose, but of the grasping, and the covetous. For
neither is there amongst these, diligence nor care about the things
needful, but about pampering the belly, and drunkenness, and other like
unseemliness; but with the others about self-restraint. Therefore
nowhere did Christ enter into a gorgeous house, but into that of the
publican and chief publican, and fisherman, leaving the kings’
palaces, and them that are clothed with soft raiment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXIX-p55">If then thou also desirest to invite Him, deck thy house
with alms, with prayers, with supplications, with vigils. These are the
decorations of Christ the King, but those of mammon, the enemy of
Christ. Let no one be ashamed then of a humble house, if it hath this
furniture; let no rich man pride himself on having a costly house, but
let him rather hide his face, and seek after this other, forsaking
that, that both here he may receive Christ, and there enjoy the eternal
tabernacles, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and might world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p10">But this other point is worth inquiry, wherefore they
were bearing swords? For that they bore them is evident not hence only,
but from their saying when asked, “here are two.” But
wherefore did Christ even permit them to have swords? For Luke affirms
this too, that He said unto them, “When I sent you without purse,
and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything?” And when they said,
“Nothing,” He said unto them, “But now, he that hath
a purse, let him take it, and a scrip, and he that hath no sword, let
him sell his garment, and buy one.” And when they said,
“Here are two swords,” He said unto them, “It is
enough.”<note n="3001" id="iii.LXXX-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p11"><scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 35-38" id="iii.LXXX-p11.1" parsed="|Luke|22|35|22|38" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.35-Luke.22.38">Luke xxii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p12">Wherefore then did He suffer them to have them? To
assure them that He was to be betrayed. Therefore He saith unto them,
“Let him buy a sword,” not that they should

<pb n="483" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_483.html" id="iii.LXXX-Page_483" />

arm themselves, far from it; but by this,
indicating His being betrayed.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p13">And wherefore doth He mention a scrip also? He was
teaching them henceforth to be sober, and wakeful, and to use much
diligence on their own part. For at the beginning He cherished them (as
being inexperienced) with much putting forth of His power but
afterwards bringing them forth as young birds out of the nest, He
commands them to use their own wings. Then, that they might not suppose
that it was for weakness He is letting them alone, in commanding them
also to work their part, He reminds them of the former things, saying,
“When I sent you without purse, lacked ye anything?” that
by both they might learn His power, both wherein He protected them, and
wherein He now leaveth them to themselves by degrees.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p14">But whence were the swords there? They were come forth
from the supper, and from the table. It was likely also there should be
swords because of the lamb, and that the disciples, hearing that
certain were coming forth against Him, took them for defense, as
meaning to fight in behalf of their Master, which was of their thought
only. Wherefore also Peter is rebuked for using it, and with a severe
threat. For he was resisting the servant who came, warmly indeed, yet
not defending himself, but doing this in behalf of his Master.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p15">Christ however suffered not any harm to ensue. For He
healed him, and showed forth a great miracle, enough to indicate at
once both His forbearance and His power, and the affection and meekness
of His disciple. For then he acted from affection, now with
dutifulness. For when he heard, “Put up thy sword into its
sheath,”<note n="3002" id="iii.LXXX-p15.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p16"><scripRef passage="John xviii. 11" id="iii.LXXX-p16.1" parsed="|John|18|11|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.11">John xviii.
11</scripRef>.</p></note>he obeyed straightway, and afterwards nowhere doeth this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p17">But another saith, that they moreover asked,
“Shall we smite?”<note n="3003" id="iii.LXXX-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p18"><scripRef passage="Luke xxii. 49" id="iii.LXXX-p18.1" parsed="|Luke|22|49|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.22.49">Luke xxii.
49</scripRef>.</p></note>but that He forbad it, and healed the man, and rebuked His disciple,
and threatened, that He might move him to obedience. “For all
they that take the sword,” He said, “shall die with the
sword.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p19">And he adds a reason, saying, “Think ye that I
cannot pray to my Father, and He shall presently give me more than
twelve legions of angels? But that the Scriptures might be
fulfilled.”<note n="3004" id="iii.LXXX-p19.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p20"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 53, 54" id="iii.LXXX-p20.1" parsed="|Matt|26|53|26|54" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.53-Matt.26.54">Matt. xxvi.
53, 54</scripRef>.</p></note> By these words He quenched their anger, indicating that to the
Scriptures also, this seemed good. Wherefore there too He prayed, that
they might take meekly what befell Him, when they had learnt that this
again is done according to God’s will.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p21">And by these two things, He comforted them, both by the
punishment of them that are plotting against Him, “For all
they,” He saith, “that take the sword shall perish with the
sword;” and by His not undergoing these things against His will,
“For I can pray,” He saith, “to my Father.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p22">And wherefore did He not say, “Think ye that I
cannot destroy them all?” Because He was more likely to be
believed in saying what He did say; for not yet had they the right
belief concerning Him. And a little while before He had said, “My
soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death,” and, “Father,
let the cup pass from me;”<note n="3005" id="iii.LXXX-p22.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p23"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 38, 39" id="iii.LXXX-p23.1" parsed="|Matt|26|38|26|39" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.38-Matt.26.39">Matt. xxvi.
38, 39</scripRef>.</p></note>and He had appeared in an agony and sweating, and strengthened by an
angel.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p24">Since then He had shown forth many tokens of human
nature, He did not seem likely to speak so as to be believed, if He had
said, “Think ye that I cannot destroy them.” Therefore He
saith, “What, think ye that I cannot pray to my Father?”
And again He speaks it humbly, in saying, “He will presently give
me twelve legions of angels.” For if one angel slew one hundred
and eighty-five armed thousands,<note n="3006" id="iii.LXXX-p24.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p25"><scripRef passage="2 Kings xix. 35" id="iii.LXXX-p25.1" parsed="|2Kgs|19|35|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.19.35">2 Kings
xix. 35</scripRef>.</p></note>what need of twelve legions against a thousand men? But He frames His
language with a view to their terror and weakness, for indeed they were
dead with fear. Wherefore also He brings against them the Scriptures,
saying, “How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled?”
alarming them by this also. For if this be approved by the Scriptures,
do ye oppose and fight against them?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p26">2. And to His disciples He saith these things; but to
the others, “Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and
staves for to take me? I sat daily teaching in the temple, and ye laid
no hold on me.”<note n="3007" id="iii.LXXX-p26.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 55" id="iii.LXXX-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|26|55|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.55">Matt. xxvi.

“robber”…“ to seize me”…“ye
took me not.”]</p></note>
</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p28">See how many things He doeth that might awaken them. He
cast them to the ground, He healed the servant’s ear, He
threatened them with being slain; “For they shall perish with the
sword,” He saith, “who take the sword.” By the
healing of the ear, He gave assurance of these things also; from every
quarter, both from the things present, and from the things to come,
manifesting His power, and showing that it was not a work of their
strength to seize Him. Wherefore He also adds, “I was daily with
you, and sat teaching, and ye laid no hold on me;” by this also
making it manifest, that the seizure

<pb n="484" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_484.html" id="iii.LXXX-Page_484" />

was of His permission. He passed over the
miracles, and mentions the teaching, that He might not seem to
boast.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p29">When I taught, ye laid no hold on me; when I held my
peace, did ye come against me? I was in the temple, and no one seized
me, and now do ye come upon me late and at midnight with swords and
staves? What need was there of these weapons against Him, who was with
you always? by these things teaching them, that unless He had
voluntarily yielded, not even then would they have succeeded. For
neither could they (who were not able to hold Him when in their hands,
and who, when they had got Him in the midst of them, had not prevailed)
even then have succeeded, unless He had been willing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p30">After this, He solves also the difficulty why He willed
it then. For, “this was done,” He saith, “that the
Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”<note n="3008" id="iii.LXXX-p30.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p31"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 56" id="iii.LXXX-p31.1" parsed="|Matt|26|56|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.56">Matt. xxvi.
56</scripRef>.</p></note> See how even up to the last hour, and in the very act of being
betrayed, He did all things for their amendment, healing, prophesying,
threatening. “For,” He saith, “they shall perish by
the sword.” To show that He is suffering voluntarily, He saith,
“I was daily with you teaching;” to manifest His accordance
with the Father, He adds, “That the Scriptures of the prophets
might be fulfilled.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p32">But wherefore did they not lay hold on Him in the
temple? Because they would not have dared in the temple, on account of
the people. Wherefore also He went forth without, both by the place and
by the time giving them security, and even to the last hour taking away
their excuse. For He who, in order that He might obey the prophets,
gave up even Himself, how did He teach things contrary to them?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p33">“Then all His disciples,” it is said,
“forsook Him, and fled.” For when He was seized, they
remained; but when He had said these things to the multitudes, they
fled. For thenceforth they saw that escape was no longer possible, when
He was giving Himself up to them voluntarily, and saying, that this was
done according to the Scriptures.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p34">And when these were fled, “they lead Him away to
Caiaphas; but Peter followed, and entered in to see what the end should
be.”<note n="3009" id="iii.LXXX-p34.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p35"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvi. 57, 58" id="iii.LXXX-p35.1" parsed="|Matt|26|57|26|58" osisRef="Bible:Matt.26.57-Matt.26.58">Matt. xxvi.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p36">Great was the fervor of the disciple; neither did he fly
when he saw them flying, but stood his ground, and went in with Him.
And if John did so too, yet he was “known to the high
priest.”<note n="3010" id="iii.LXXX-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p37"><scripRef passage="John xviii. 15" id="iii.LXXX-p37.1" parsed="|John|18|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.15">John xviii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p38">And why did they lead Him away there where they were all
assembled? That they might do all things with consent of the chief
priests. For he was then high priest, and all were waiting for Christ
there, to such a degree did they spend the whole night, and give up
their sleep for this object. For neither did they then eat the
passover, but watched for this other purpose. For John, when he had
said that “it was early,” added, “they entered into
the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat
the passover.”<note n="3011" id="iii.LXXX-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p39"><scripRef passage="John xviii. 28" id="iii.LXXX-p39.1" parsed="|John|18|28|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.28">John xviii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p40">What must we say then? That they ate it on another day,
and broke the law, on account of their eager desire about this murder.
For Christ would not have transgressed as to the time of the passover,
but they who were daring all things, and trampling under foot a
thousand laws. For since they were exceedingly boiling with rage, and
having often attempted to seize Him, had not been able; having then
taken Him unexpectedly, they chose even to pass by the passover, for
the sake of satiating their murderous lust.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p41">Wherefore also they were all assembled together, and it
was a council of pestilent men,<note n="3012" id="iii.LXXX-p41.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p42"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXX-p42.1">συνδριον

appearance of a court of justice. For “neither did their
testimonies agree together;”<note n="3013" id="iii.LXXX-p42.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p43"><scripRef passage="Mark xiv. 56, 59" id="iii.LXXX-p43.1" parsed="|Mark|14|56|0|0;|Mark|14|59|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Mark.14.56 Bible:Mark.14.59">Mark xiv.

peace, and from that time forth gainsaid Him no more. Why then did they
now call the saying a blasphemy? And wherefore also did Christ thus
answer them? To take away all their excuse, because unto the last day
He taught that He was Christ, and that He sitteth at the right hand of
the Father, and that He will come again to judge the world, which was
the language of one manifesting His full accordance with the
Father.</p>

a case of confessed sins, and manifest blasphemy. For, inasmuch as they
knew that if the thing came to be inquired into, and carefully decided,
it would free Him from all blame, they condemn Him amongst themselves,
and anticipate the hearers by saying, “Ye have heard the
blasphemy;” all but necessitating and forcing them to deliver the
sentence. What then say they? “He is guilty of death;” that
having taken Him as condemned, they should thus work upon Pilate
thereupon to pass sentence. In which matter those others also being
accomplices say, “He is guilty of death;” themselves
accusing, themselves judging, themselves passing sentence, themselves
being everything then.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p57">But wherefore did they not bring forward the Sabbaths?
Because He had often stopped their mouths; and moreover they wanted to
take Him, and condemn Him by the things then said. And <i>the high
priest</i> anticipated them, and gave the sentence as from them, and
drew them all on by rending his vestments, and having led Him away as
now condemned unto Pilate, thus did all.</p>

thee;” attempting to put Him to death by political accusations.
And wherefore did they not slay Him secretly? They were desirous also
to bring up an evil report against His fame. For since many had now
heard Him, and were admiring Him, and amazed at Him, therefore they
endeavored that He should be put to death publicly, and in the presence
of all.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p60">But Christ hindered it not, but made full use of their
wickedness for the establishment of the truth, so that His death should
be manifest. And the result was the contrary to what they wished. For
they wished to make a show of it, as in this way disgracing Him, but He
even by these very things shone forth the more. And much as they said,
“Let us put Him to death, lest the Romans come and take away our
place and nation;”<note n="3022" id="iii.LXXX-p60.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p61"><scripRef passage="John xi. 48" id="iii.LXXX-p61.1" parsed="|John|11|48|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.11.48">John xi.

their object was to crucify Him publicly, that they might injure His
fame, and the contrary result took place.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p65">But all these things are done for the truth, so that
they might not have so much as any shadow of a defense that is surely
shameless. And at the sepulchre too, in the like manner, the seals and
the watches made the truth to be the more conspicuous; and the
mockings, and the jeerings, and the revilings, wrought again this
self-same effect.</p>

shame, and defeated, and ruined; but He that seemed to be defeated,
this man above all hath both shone forth, and conquered mightily.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p67">Let us not then everywhere seek victory, nor everywhere
shun defeat. There is an occasion when victory brings hurt, but defeat

profit. For, for instance, in the
case of them that are angry; he that hath been very outrageous seems to
have prevailed; but this man above all is the one subdued and hurt by
the most grievous passion; but he that hath endured nobly, this man
hath got the better and conquered. And while the one hath not had
strength to overcome so much as his own disease; the other hath removed
another man’s; this hath been subdued by his own, that hath got
the better even of another’s passion; and so far from being burnt
up, he quenched the flame of another when raised to a height. But if he
had minded to gain what seems to be victory, both he himself would have
been overcome; and having inflamed the other, he would have occasioned
him to have suffered this more grievously; and, like women, both the
one and the other would have been disgracefully and miserably
overthrown by their anger. But now he that hath exercised self-control
is both freed from this disgrace, and hath erected a glorious trophy
over anger both in himself and in his neighbor, through his honorable
defeat.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p68">4. Let us not then everywhere seek victory. For he that
hath overreached hath conquered the person wronged, but with an evil
victory, and one that brings destruction to him that has won it; but he
that is wronged, and seems to have been conquered, if he have borne it
with self-command, this above all is the one that hath the crown. For
often to be defeated is better, and this is the best mode of victory.
For whether one overreaches, or smites, or envies, he that is defeated,
and enters not into the conflict, this is he who hath the victory.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p69">And why do I speak of overreaching and envy? For he also
that is dragged to martyrdom, thus conquers by being bound, and beaten,
and maimed, and slain. And what is in wars defeat, namely, for the
combatant to fall; this with us is victory. For nowhere do we overcome
by doing wrongfully, but everywhere by suffering wrongfully. Thus also
doth the victory become more glorious, when we sufferers get the better
of the doers. Hereby it is shown that the victory is of God. For indeed
it hath an opposite nature to outward conquest, which fact is again
above all an infallible sign of strength. Thus also the rocks in the
sea, by being struck, break the waves; thus also all the saints were
proclaimed, and crowned, and set up their glorious trophies, winning
this tranquil victory. “For stir not thyself,” He saith,
“neither weary thyself. God hath given thee this might, to
conquer not by conflict, but by endurance alone. Do not oppose thyself
also as he does, and thou hast conquered; conflict not, and thou hast
gained the crown.<note n="3025" id="iii.LXXX-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p70">[The following clause is omitted in the translation:
“Much better and stronger art thou than thine
antagonist.”—R.]</p></note> Why dost thou disgrace thyself? Allow him not to say that by
conflicting thou hast got the better, but suffer him to be amazed and
to marvel at thy invincible power; and to say to all, that even without
entering into conflict thou hast conquered.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p71">Thus also the blessed Joseph obtained a good report,
everywhere by suffering wrong getting the better of them who were doing
it. For his brethren and the Egyptian woman were amongst those that
were plotting against him, but over all did this man prevail. For tell
me not of the prison, wherein this man dwelt, nor of the kings’
courts where she abode, but show me who it is that is conquered, who it
is that is defeated, who that is in despondency, who that is in
pleasure. For she, so far from being able to prevail over the righteous
man, could not master so much as her own passion; but this man
prevailed both over her and over that grievous disease. But if thou
wilt, hear her very words, and thou shalt see the trophy. “Thou
broughtest in unto us here an Hebrew servant to mock us.”<note n="3026" id="iii.LXXX-p71.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXX-p72"><scripRef passage="Gen. xxxix. 17" id="iii.LXXX-p72.1" parsed="|Gen|39|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Gen.39.17">Gen. xxxix.

the devil that told thee that thou couldest break down the adamant.
This <i>thy husband</i> brought not in unto thee an Hebrew servant to
plot against thee, but the wicked spirit brought in that unclean
lasciviousness; he it was that mocked thee.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p73">What then did Joseph? He held his peace, and thus is
condemned, even as Christ is also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p74">For all those things are types of these. And he indeed
was in bonds, and she in royal courts. Yet what is this? For he was
more glorious than any crowned victor, even while continuing in his
bonds, but she was in a more wretched condition than any prisoner,
while abiding in royal chambers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p75">But not hence alone may one see the victory, and the
defeat, but by the end itself. For which accomplished his desired
object? The prisoner, not the high born lady? For he strove to keep his
chastity, but she to destroy it. Which then accomplished what he
desired? he who suffered wrong, or she who did the wrong. It is quite
plain, that it is he who suffered. Surely then this is the one who hath
conquered.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXX-p76">Knowing then these things, let us follow after this
victory, which is obtained by suffering wrong, let us flee from that
which is got

by doing wrong. For
so shall we both live this present life in all tranquility, and great
quietness, and shall attain unto the good things to come, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
might world without end. Amen.</p>

very great glory, as indeed it was, that the Lord of the universe
should endure to suffer such things for us. This shows both His
unutterable tenderness, and the inexcusable wickedness of those men,
who had the heart to do such things to Him that was so mild and meek,
and was charming them with such words, as were enough to change a lion
into a lamb. For neither did He fail in any things of gentleness, nor
they of insolence and cruelty, in what they did, in what they said. All
which things the prophet Isaiah foretold, thus proclaiming beforehand,

full swing in every way to their own madness. For indeed they inflicted
the blows that are most insulting of all, buffeting, smiting with the
palms of their hands, and to these blows adding the insult of spitting
at Him. And words again teeming with much derision did they speak,

he becomes a denier. For who would not have been inflamed to madness by
the things that were then done? yet the disciple, overcome by fears, so
far from showing indignation, even denies, and endures not the threat
of a miserable and mean girl, and not once only, but a second and third
time doth he deny Him; and in a short period, and not so much as before

crowing the cock is wont to crow both a third and a fourth time, Mark,
to show that not even the sound checked him, and brought him to
recollection saith this. So that both things are true. For before the
cock had finished the one crowing, he had denied a third time. And not

lest he should be betrayed by his tears, but “he went out, and
wept bitterly.”</p>

like this; he suffers not those that are not watchful to see the evil

Jesus was saying so many things, he was not influenced, but when his
offense was completed, then repentance came upon him; and not then
profitably. For to condemn it, and to throw down the pieces of silver,
and not to regard the Jewish people, were all acceptable things; but to
hang himself, this again was unpardonable, and a work of an evil
spirit. For the devil led him out of his repentance too soon, so that
he should reap no fruit from thence; and carries him off, by a most
disgraceful death, and one manifest to all, having persuaded him to
destroy himself.</p>

ground, when He was seized; and the chief<note n="3051" id="iii.LXXXI-p44.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXI-p45"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXXI-p45.1">ὁ κορυφαο</span>.</p></note>of them even thrice denied Him, not bearing a damsel’s threat.
But, as I said, the chief priests were now troubled; for that they knew
the act was a transgression of the law is manifest, from their saying,
“See thou to that.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p46">Hear, ye covetous, consider what befell him; how he at
the same time lost the money, and committed the sin, and destroyed his
own soul. Such is the tyranny of covetousness. He enjoyed not the
money, neither the present life, nor that to come, but lost all at
once, and having got a bad character even with those very men, so
hanged himself.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p47">But, as I said, after the act, then some see clearly.
See at any rate these men too for a time not willing to have a clear
perception of the fact, but saying, “See thou to that:”
which thing of itself is a most heavy charge against them. For this is
the language of men bearing witness to their daring and their
transgression, but intoxicated by their passion, and not willing to
forbear their satanical attempts, but senselessly wrapping themselves
up in a veil of feigned ignorance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p48">For if indeed these things had been said after the
crucifixion, and His being slain, of a truth even then the saying would
have had no reasonable meaning, nevertheless it would not have
condemned them so much; but now having Him yet in your own hands, and
having power to release Him, how could ye be able to say these things?
For this defense would be a most heavy accusation against you. How? and
in what way? Because while throwing the whole blame upon the traitor
(for they say, “See thou to that”), being able to have set
themselves free from this murder of Christ, they left the traitor, and
even pressed the crime further, adding the cross to the betrayal. For
what hindered them, when they said to him, “See thou to
that,” themselves to forbear the criminal act? But now they even
do the contrary, adding to it the murder and in every thing, both by
what they do, and by what they say, entangling themselves in inevitable
ills. For indeed after these things, when Pilate left it to them, they
choose the robber to be released rather than Jesus; but Him that had
done no wrong, but had even conferred on them so many benefits, they
slew.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p49">3. What then did that man? When he saw that he was
laboring to no profit, and that they would not consent to receive the

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p52">Seest thou them again self-condemned by their
conscience? For because they knew that they had been buying the murder,
they put them not into the treasury, but bought a field to bury
strangers in. And this also became a witness against them, and a proof
of their treason. For the name of the place more clearly than a trumpet
proclaimed their blood-

guiltiness.
Neither did they it at random, but having taking counsel, and in every
case in like manner, so that no one should be clear of the deed, but
all guilty. But these things the prophecy foretold from of old. Seest
thou not the apostles only, but the prophets also declaring exactly
those things which were matters of reproach, and every way proclaiming
the passion, and indicating it beforehand?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p53">This was the case with the Jews without their being
conscious of it. For if they had cast it into the treasury, the thing
would not have been so clearly discovered; but now having bought a

generations.</p>

hundred gold pieces.</p>

food. Why dost thou insult thy Lord, offering Him unclean things? It is
better to leave men to pine with hunger, than to feed them from these
sources. That was the conduct of a cruel man, this of one both cruel
and insolent. It is better to give nothing, than to give the things of
one set of persons to others. For tell me, if you saw any two persons,
one naked, one having a garment, and then having stripped the one that
had the garment, thou wert to clothe the naked, wouldest thou not have
committed an injustice? It is surely plain to every one. But if when
thou hast given all that thou hast taken to another, thou hast
committed an injustice, and not shown mercy; when thou givest not even
a small portion of what thou robbest, and callest the deed alms, what
manner of punishment wilt thou not undergo? For if men offering lame
brutes were blamed, what favor wilt thou obtain doing things more

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p59">Let us repent then, and give alms pure from
covetousness, and in great abundance. Consider that the Jews used to
feed eight thousand Levites, and together with the Levites, widows also
and orphans, and they bore many other public charges, and together with
these things also served as soldiers; but now there are fields, and
houses, and hirings of lodgings, and carriages, and muleteers, and
mules, and a great array of this kind in the church on account of you,
and your hardness of heart. For this store of the church ought to be
with you, and your readiness of mind ought to be a revenue to her; but
now two wrong things come to pass, both you continue unfruitful, and
God’s priests do not practise their proper duties.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p60">Was it not possible for the houses and the lands to have
remained in the time of the apostles? Wherefore then did they sell them
and give away? Because this was a better thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p61">4. But now a fear seized our fathers (when you were so
mad after worldly things, and because of your gatherings, and not
dispersing abroad), lest the companies of the widows and orphans, and
of the virgins, should perish of famine; therefore were they
constrained to provide these things. For it was not their wish to
thrust themselves unto what was so unbecoming; but their desire was
that your good will should have been a supply for them, and that they
should gather their fruits from thence, and that they themselves should
give heed to prayers only.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p62">But now ye have constrained them to imitate the houses
of them that manage public affairs; whereby all things are turned
upside down. For when both you and we are entangled in the same things,
who is there to propitiate God? Therefore it is not possible for us to
open our mouths, when the state of the church is no better than that of
worldly men. Have ye not heard that the apostles would not consent so
much as to distribute the money that was collected without any trouble?
But now our bishops have gone beyond agents, and stewards, and
hucksters

<pb n="491" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_491.html" id="iii.LXXXI-Page_491" />

in their care about
these things; and when they ought to be careful and thoughtful about
your souls, they are vexing themselves every day about these things,
for which the innkeepers, and tax-gatherers, and accountants, and
stewards are careful.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p63">These things I do not mention for nought in the way of
complaint, but in order that there may be some amendment and change, in
order that we may be pitied for serving a grievous servitude, in order
that you may become a revenue and store for the church.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p64">But if ye are not willing, behold the poor before your
eyes; as many as it is possible for us to suffice, we will not cease to
feed; but those, whom it is not possible, we will leave to you, that ye
may not hear those words on the awful day, which shall be spoken to the
unmerciful and cruel. “Ye saw me an hungered, and fed me
not.”<note n="3057" id="iii.LXXXI-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXI-p65"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 42" id="iii.LXXXI-p65.1" parsed="|Matt|25|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.42">Matt. xxv.

laughing-stocks, because leaving our prayers, and our teaching, and the
other parts of holiness, we are fighting all our time, some with wine
merchants, some with corn-factors, others with them that retail other
provisions.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p67">Hence come battles, and strifes, and daily revilings,
and reproaches, and jeers, and on each of the priests names are imposed
more suitable for houses of secular men; when it would have been fit to
take other names in the place of these, and to be named from those
things, from which also the apostles ordained, from the feeding of the
hungry, from the protection of the injured, from the care of strangers,
from succoring them that are despitefully used, from providing for the
orphans, from taking part with the widows, from presiding over the
virgins; and these offices should be distributed amongst us instead of
the care of the lands and houses.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p68">These are the stores of the church, these the treasures
that become her, and that afford in great degree both ease to us and
profit to you; or rather to you ease with the profit. For I suppose
that by the grace of God they that assemble themselves here amount to
the number of one hundred thousand;<note n="3058" id="iii.LXXXI-p68.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXI-p69"><i>i.e</i>., the sum of all the congregations in
Antioch.</p></note>and if each bestowed one loaf to some one of the poor, all would be in
plenty; but if one farthing only, no one would be poor; and we should
not undergo so many revilings and jeers, in consequence of our care
about the money. For indeed the saying, “Sell thy goods, and give
to the poor, and come and follow me,”<note n="3059" id="iii.LXXXI-p69.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXI-p70"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="iii.LXXXI-p70.1" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt. xix.

respect to the property of the church. For in any other way it is not
possible to follow Him as we ought, not being freed from all grosser
and more worldly care.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p71">But now the priests of God attend at the vintage and
harvest, and at the sale and purchase of the produce; and whereas they
that served the shadow had an entire immunity from such matters,
although entrusted with a more carnal service; we, who are invited to
the very inmost shrines of the heavens, and who enter into the true
holy of holies, take upon ourselves the cares of tradesmen and retail
dealers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p72">Hence great neglect of the Scriptures, and remissness in
prayers, and indifference about all the other duties; for it is not
possible to be split into the two things with due zeal. Where I pray
and beseech you that many fountains may spring up to us from all
quarters, and that your forwardness may be to us the threshing floor
and the wine press.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXI-p73">For in this way both the poor will more easily be
supported, and God will be glorified, and ye will advance unto a
greater degree of love to mankind, and will enjoy the good things
eternal; unto which God grant we may all attain, by the grace and love
towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world without
end. Amen.</p>

this suspicion, He both paid tribute,<note n="3063" id="iii.LXXXII-p9.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p10"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxii. 17" id="iii.LXXXII-p10.1" parsed="|Matt|22|17|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.22.17">Matt. xxii.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p12">Wherefore then did he not bring forward these things, it
may be said, at that time, when accused of usurpation? Because having
the proofs from His acts, of His power, His meekness, His gentleness,
beyond number, they were willfully blind, and dealt unfairly, and the
tribunal was corrupt. For these reasons then He replies to nothing, but
holds His peace, yet answering briefly (so as not to get the reputation
of arrogance from continual silence) when the high priest adjured Him,
when the governor asked, but in reply to their accusations He no longer
saith anything; for He was not now likely to persuade them. Even as the
prophet declaring this self-same thing from of old, said, “In His
humiliation His judgment was taken away.”<note n="3065" id="iii.LXXXII-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p13"><scripRef passage="Isa. liii. 8" id="iii.LXXXII-p13.1" parsed="|Isa|53|8|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.53.8">Isa. liii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p14">At these things the governor marvelled, and indeed it
was worthy of admiration to see Him showing such great forbearance, and
holding His peace, Him that had countless things to say. For neither
did they accuse Him from knowing of any evil thing in Him, but from
jealousy and envy only. At least when they had set false witness,
wherefore, having nothing to say, did they still urge their point? and
when they saw Judas was dead, and that Pilate had washed his hands of
it, why were they not pricked with remorse. For indeed He did many
things even at the very time, that they might recover themselves, but
by none were they amended.</p>

also he said these things; but since He answered nothing, he devises
another thing again.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p17">Of what nature was this? It was a custom for them to
release one of the condemned, and by this means he attempted to deliver
Him. For if you are not willing to release Him as innocent, yet as
guilty pardon Him for the feast’s sake.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p18">Seest thou order reversed? For the petition in behalf of
the condemned it was customary to be with the people, and the granting
it with the rulers; but now the contrary hath come to pass, and the
ruler petitions the people; and not even so do they become gentle, but
grow more savage and bloodthirsty, driven to frenzy by the passion of
envy. For neither had they whereof they should accuse Him, and this
though He was silent, but they were refuted even then by reason of the
abundance of His righteous deeds, and being silent He overcame them
that say ten thousand things, and are maddened.</p>

it was ordered that the wife should see it, so that it might be

from blame, and how much diligence they employed, so as not to leave to
themselves so much as a shadow of an excuse. For which was right? to
let go the acknowledged criminal, or Him about whose guilt there was a
question? For, if in the case of acknowledged offenders it was fit
there should be a liberation, much more in those of whom there was a
doubt. For surely this man did not seem to them worse than acknowledged
murderers. For on this account, it is not merely said they had a
robber; but one noted, that is, who was infamous in wickedness, who had
perpetrated countless murders. But nevertheless even him did they
prefer to the Saviour of the world, and neither did they reverence the
season because it was holy, nor the laws of humanity, nor any other
thing of the kind, but envy had once for all blinded them. And besides
their own wickedness, they corrupt the people also, that for deceiving
them too they might suffer the most extreme punishment.</p>

to choose, that at least out of shame they might ask for Him, and the

be saved out of humanity, carries with it persuasion and entreaty that
cannot be gainsaid.</p>

sedition had taken place on his account, and a tumult, nevertheless he
stood firm against all. But not so this man, but he was extremely
unmanly and weak, and all were corrupt together. For neither did this
man stand firm against the multitude, nor the multitude against the
Jews,<note n="3073" id="iii.LXXXII-p30.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p31"><i>i.e</i>., the Jewish rulers; Mr. Field has

especially in St. John’s Gospel.</p></note>and in every way their excuse was taken away. For they “cried out
exceedingly,” that is, cried out the more, “Let Him be
crucified.” For they desired not only to put Him to death, but
also that it should be on a charge of wickedness, and though the judge
was contradicting them, they continued to cry out the same thing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p32">Seest thou how many things Christ did in order to
recover them? For like as He often times checked Judas, so likewise did
He restrain these men too, both throughout all His Gospel, and at the
very time of His condemnation. For surely when they saw the ruler and
the judge washing his hands of it,

<pb n="494" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_494.html" id="iii.LXXXII-Page_494" />

and saying, “I am innocent of this blood,” they
should have been moved to compunction both by what was said, and by
what was done, as well when they saw Judas had hanged himself, as when
they saw Pilate himself entreating them to take another in the place of
Him. For when the accuser and traitor condemns himself, and he who
gives sentence puts off from himself the guilt, and such a vision
appears the very night, and even as condemned he begs Him off, what
kind of plea will they have? For if they were not willing that He
should be innocent, yet they should not have preferred to him even a
robber, one that was acknowledged to be such, and very notorious.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p33">What then did they? When they saw the judge washing his
hands, and saying, “I am innocent,” they cried out
“His blood be on us, and on our children.”<note n="3074" id="iii.LXXXII-p33.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p34"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 25" id="iii.LXXXII-p34.1" parsed="|Matt|27|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.25">Matt.

yielded that all should be done.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p35">See here too their great madness. For passion and wicked
desire are like this. They suffer not men to see anything of what is
right. For be it that ye curse yourselves; why do you draw down the
curse upon your children also?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p36">Nevertheless, the lover of man, though they acted with
so much madness, both against themselves, and against their children,
so far from confirming their sentence upon their children, confirmed it
not even on them, but from the one and from the other received those
that repented, and counts them worthy of good things beyond number. For
indeed even Paul was of them, and the thousands that believed in
Jerusalem; for, “thou seest it is said, brother, how many
thousands of Jews there are which believe.”<note n="3075" id="iii.LXXXII-p36.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p37"><scripRef passage="Acts xxi. 20" id="iii.LXXXII-p37.1" parsed="|Acts|21|20|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.21.20">Acts xxi.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p40">And wherefore did he scourge Him. Either as one
condemned, or willing to invest the judgment with due form, or to
please them. And yet he ought to have resisted them. For indeed even
before this he had said, “Take ye Him, and judge Him according to
your law.”<note n="3077" id="iii.LXXXII-p40.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p41"><scripRef passage="John xviii. 31" id="iii.LXXXII-p41.1" parsed="|John|18|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.18.31">John xviii.

the signs and the miracles, and the great patience of Him, who was
suffering these things, and above all His untold silence. For since
both by His defense of Himself, and by His prayers, He had shown His
humanity, again He showeth His exaltedness and the greatness of His
nature, both by His silence, and by His contemning what is said; by all
leading them on to marvel at Himself.<note n="3078" id="iii.LXXXII-p41.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p42"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXXII-p42.1">πρ τ

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p43">3. For when once the reasoning powers are overwhelmed as
it were by intoxication or some wild insanity, it would be hard for the
sinking soul to rise again, if it be not very noble.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p44">For it is fearful, it is fearful to give place to these
wicked passions, wherefore it were fit in every way to ward off and
repel their entering in. For when they have laid hold of the soul, and
got the dominion over it, like as fire lighting upon a wood, so do they
kindle the flame to a blaze.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p45">Wherefore I entreat you to do all things so as to fence
off their entrance; and not by comforting yourselves with this
heartless reasoning to bring in upon yourselves all wickedness, saying,
what of this? What of that? For countless ills have their birth from
hence. For the devil, being depraved, makes use of much craft, and
exertion, and self-abasement for the ruin of men, and begins his attack
on them with things of a more trifling nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p46">And mark it, he desired to bring Saul into superstition
of witchcraft. But if he had counselled this at the beginning, the
other would not have given heed; for how should he, who was even
driving them out? Therefore gently and by little and little he leads
him on to it. For when he had disobeyed Samuel, and had caused the
burnt-offering to be offered, when he was not present, being blamed for
it, he says, “The compulsion from the enemy was too
great,”<note n="3079" id="iii.LXXXII-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p47">Cf. <scripRef passage="1 Sam. 13.12; 28.15" id="iii.LXXXII-p47.1" parsed="|1Sam|13|12|0|0;|1Sam|28|15|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Sam.13.12 Bible:1Sam.28.15">1 Sam. xiii. 12; and xxviii. 15</scripRef>.</p></note>and when he ought to have bewailed, he felt as though he had done
nothing.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p48">Again God gave him the commands about the Amalekites,
but he transgressed these too. Thence he proceeded to his crimes about
David, and thus slipping easily and by little and little he stayed not,
until he came unto the very pit of destruction, and cast himself in. So
likewise in the case of Cain, he did not at once urge him to slay his
brother, since he would not have persuaded him, but first wrought upon
him to offer things more or less vile, saying, “This is no
sin:” in the second place he kindled envy and jealousy, saying,
neither is there anything in this;

<pb n="495" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_495.html" id="iii.LXXXII-Page_495" />

thirdly, he persuaded him to slay and to deny
his murder; and did not leave him before he had put on him the crowning
act of evil.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p49">Wherefore it is necessary for us to resist the
beginning. For at any rate, even if the first sins stopped at
themselves, not even so were it right to despise the first sins; but
now they go on also to what is greater, when the mind is careless.
Wherefore we ought to do all things to remove the beginnings of
them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p50">For look not now at the nature of the sin, that it is
little, but that it becomes a root of great sin when neglected. For if
one may say something marvellous, great sins need not so much
earnestness, as such as are little, and of small account. For the
former the very nature of the sin causes us to abhor, but the little
sins by this very thing cast us into remissness; and allow us not to
rouse ourselves heartily for their removal. Wherefore also they quickly
become great, while we sleep. This one may see happening in bodies
also.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p51">So likewise in the instance of Judas, that great
wickedness had its birth. For if it had not seemed to him a little
thing to steal the money of the poor, he would not have been led on to
this treachery. Unless it had seemed to the Jews a little thing to be
taken captive by vainglory, they would not have run on the rock of
becoming Christ’s murderers. And indeed all evils we may see
arise from this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p52">For no one quickly and at once rusheth out into vices.
For the soul hath, yea it hath a shame implanted in us, and a reverence
for right things; and it would not at once become so shameless as in
one act to cast away everything, but slowly, and by little and little
doth it perish, when it is careless. Thus also did idolatry enter in,
men being honored beyond measure, both the living and the departed;
thus also were idols worshipped; thus too did whoredom prevail, and the
other evils.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p53">And see. One man laughed unseasonably; another blamed
him; a third took away the fear, by saying, nothing comes of this.
“For what is laughing? What can come of it?” Of this is
bred foolish jesting; from that filthy talking; then filthy doings.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p54">Again, another being blamed for slandering his
neighbors, and reviling, and calumniating, despised it, saying,
evil-speaking is nothing. By this he begets hatred unspeakable,
revilings without end; by the revilings blows, and by the blows
oftentimes murder.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p55">4. From these little things then that wicked spirit thus
brings in the great sins; and from the great despair; having invented
this other while not less mischievous than the former. For to sin
destroys not so much as to despair. For he that hath offended, if he be
vigilant, speedily by repentance amends what hath been done; but he
that hath learnt to despond, and doth not repent, by reason thereof
fails of this amendment by not applying the remedies from
repentance.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p56">And he hath a third grievous snare; as when he invests
the sin with a show of devotion. And where hath the devil so far
prevailed as to deceive to this degree? Hear, and beware of his
devices. Christ by Paul commanded “that a woman depart not from
her husband,<note n="3080" id="iii.LXXXII-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p57"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. vii. 10" id="iii.LXXXII-p57.1" parsed="|1Cor|7|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.7.10">1 Cor. vii.

5</scripRef>.</p></note>but some from a love of continence forsooth, having withdrawn from
their own husbands, as though they were doing something devout, have
driven them to adultery. Consider now what an evil it is that they,
undergoing so much toil, should be blamed as having committed the
greatest injustice, and should suffer extreme punishment, and drive
their husbands into the pit of destruction.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p59">Others again, abstaining from meats by a rule of
fasting, have by degrees gone so far as to abhor them; which even of
itself brings a very great punishment.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p60">But this comes to pass, when any hold fast their own
prejudices contrary to what is approved by the Scriptures. Those also
among the Corinthians thought it was a part of perfection to eat of all
things without distinction, even of things forbidden, but nevertheless
this was not of perfection, but of the utmost lawlessness. Wherefore
also Paul earnestly reproves them, and pronounces them to be worthy of
extreme punishment. Others again think it a sign of piety to wear long
hair. And yet this is amongst the things forbidden, and carries with it
much disgrace.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p61">Again, others follow after excessive sorrow for their
sins as a profitable thing; yet it also comes of the devil’s
wiles, and Judas showed it; at least in consequence thereof he even
hanged himself. Therefore Paul again was in fear about him that had
committed fornication, lest any such thing should befall him, and
persuaded the Corinthians speedily to deliver him, “lest perhaps
such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.”<note n="3082" id="iii.LXXXII-p61.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p62"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 7" id="iii.LXXXII-p62.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|7|0|0" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.7">2 Cor. ii.
7</scripRef>.</p></note> Then, indicating that such a result cometh of the snares of that wicked
one, he saith, “Lest Satan should get an advantage over us, for
we are not ignorant of his devices,”<note n="3083" id="iii.LXXXII-p62.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p63"><scripRef passage="2 Cor. ii. 10, 11" id="iii.LXXXII-p63.1" parsed="|2Cor|2|10|2|11" osisRef="Bible:2Cor.2.10-2Cor.2.11">2 Cor. ii.
10, 11</scripRef>.</p></note>meaning that he assails us with much craft. Since if he fought against
us plainly and openly, the victory would be ready and easy; or rather
even now, if we be vigilant, victory

<pb n="496" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_496.html" id="iii.LXXXII-Page_496" />

will be ready. For indeed against each one of those ways
God hath armed us.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p64">For to persuade us not to despise even these little
things, hear what warning He gives us, saying, “He that saith to
his brother, thou fool, shall be in danger of hell;”<note n="3084" id="iii.LXXXII-p64.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXII-p65"><scripRef passage="Matt. v. 22" id="iii.LXXXII-p65.1" parsed="|Matt|5|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.5.22">Matt. v.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p69">But about not despairing, it is said, “Doth he

Scripture. And in order not to be ruined under the guise of godly fear,
hear Paul saying, “Lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up by
overmuch sorrow.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p73">Knowing therefore these things, let us set for a barrier
in all the ways that pervert the unwary the wisdom which is drawn from
the Scriptures. Neither say, why, what is it, if I gaze curiously at a
beautiful woman? For if thou shouldest commit the adultery in the
heart, soon thou wilt venture on that in flesh. Say not, why, what is
it if I should pass by this poor man? For if thou pass this man by,
thou wilt also the next; if him, then the third.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p74">Neither again say, why, what is it, if I should desire
my neighbor’s goods. For this, this caused Ahab’s ruin;
although he would have paid a price, yet he took it from one unwilling.
For a man ought not to buy by force, but on persuasion. But if he, who
would have paid the fair price, was so punished, because he took from
one unwilling, he who doeth not so much as this, and taketh by violence
from the unwilling, and that when living under grace, of what
punishment will he not be worthy?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXII-p75">In order therefore that we be not punished, keeping
ourselves quite pure from all violence and rapine, and guarding against
the sources of sins together with the sins themselves, let us with much
diligence give heed to virtue; for thus shall we also enjoy the good
things eternal by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p8">And the insults were different, and varied. For that
Divine Head at one time they buffeted, at another they insulted with
the crown of thorns, at another they smote with the reed, men unholy
and accursed!</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p9">What plea shall we have after this for being moved by
injuries, after Christ suffered these things? For what was done was the
utmost limit of insolence. For not one member, but the whole entire
body throughout was made an object of insolence; the head through the
crown, and the reed, and the buffeting; the face, being spit upon; the
cheeks, being smitten with the palms of the hands; the whole body by
the stripes, by being wrapped in the robe, and by the pretended
worship; the hand by the reed, which they gave him to hold instead of a
sceptre; the mouth again by the offering of the vinegar. What could be
more grievous than these things? What more insulting?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p10">For the things that were done go beyond all language.
For as though they were afraid lest they should seem to fall short at
all in the crime, having killed the prophets with their own hands, but
this man with the sentence of a judge, so they do in every deed; and
make it the work of their own hands, and condemn and sentence both
among themselves and before Pilate, saying, “His blood be on us
and on our children,”<note n="3094" id="iii.LXXXIII-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIII-p11"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 25" id="iii.LXXXIII-p11.1" parsed="|Matt|27|25|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.25">Matt.

leading Him away, and render themselves authors of the spiteful acts
done by the soldiers, and nail Him to the cross, and revile Him, and
spit at Him, and deride Him. For Pilate contributed nothing in this
matter, but they themselves did every thing, becoming accusers, and
judges, and executioners, and all.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p12">And these things are read amongst us, when all meet
together. For that the heathens may not say, that ye display to people
and nations the things that are glorious and illustrious, such as the
signs and the miracles, but that ye hide these which are matters of
reproach; the grace of the Spirit hath brought it to pass, that in the
full festival, when men in multitude and women are present, and all, as
one may say, at the great eve of the passover, then all these things
should be read; when the whole world is present, then are all these
acts proclaimed with a clear voice. And these being read, and made
known to all, Christ is believed to be God and, besides all the rest,
is worshipped, even because of this, that He vouchsafed to stoop so
much for us as actually to suffer these things, and to teach us all
virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p13">These things then let us read continually; for indeed
great is the gain, great the advantage to be thence obtained. For when
thou seest Him, both by gestures and by deeds, mocked and worshipped
with so much derision, and beaten and suffering the utmost insults,
though thou be very stone, thou wilt become softer than any wax, and
wilt cast out of thy soul all haughtiness.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p14">Hear therefore also what follows. For after “they
had mocked Him, they led Him to crucify Him,”<note n="3095" id="iii.LXXXIII-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIII-p15"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 31" id="iii.LXXXIII-p15.1" parsed="|Matt|27|31|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.31">Matt.

sat down and watched Him, when He should die. And they divide His
garments amongst them, which sort of thing is done in the case of very
vile and abject criminals, and such as have no one belonging to them,
and are in utter desolation.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p16">They parted the garments, by which such great miracles
were done. But they wrought none now, Christ restraining His
unspeakable power. And this was no small addition of insult. For as to
one base and abject, as I said, and the vilest of all men; so do they
dare to do all things. To the thieves at any rate they did nothing of
the kind, but to Christ they dare it all. And they crucified Him in the
midst of them, that He might share in their reputation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p17">And they gave Him gall to drink, and this to insult Him,
but He would not. But another saith, that having tasted it, He said,
“It is finished.”<note n="3096" id="iii.LXXXIII-p17.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIII-p18"><scripRef passage="John xix. 30" id="iii.LXXXIII-p18.1" parsed="|John|19|30|0|0" osisRef="Bible:John.19.30">John xix.

fulfilled concerning Him. “For they gave me,” it is said,

taste differs not from not drinking, but hath one and the same
signification.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p20">But nevertheless not even here doth their contumely
stop, but after having stripped and crucified Him, and offered Him
vinegar, they proceeded still further, and beholding Him impaled upon
the cross, they revile Him, both they themselves and the passers by;
and this was more grievous than all, that on the charge of being an
impostor and deceiver He suffered these things, and as a boaster, and
vainly pretending what He said. Therefore they both crucified Him
publicly, that they might make a show of it in the sight of all; and
therefore also they did it by the hands of the soldiers, that these
things being perpetrated even by a public tribunal, the insult might be
the greater.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p21">2. And yet who would not have been moved by the
multitude that was following Him, and lamenting Him? Nay, not these
wild beasts. Wherefore also He to the multitude vouchsafes an answer,
but to these men not so. For after having done what they would, they
endeavor also to injure His honor, fearing His resurrection. Therefore
they say these things publicly, and crucified thieves with Him, and
wishing to prove Him a deceiver, they say, “Thou that destroyest

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p27">O execrable; most execrable! What, were not the prophets
prophets, nor the righteous men righteous, because God rescued them not
out of their dangers. Nay surely they were, though suffering these
things. What then could be equal to your folly? For if the coming of
the dangers upon them did not injure their honor with you, how much
more in the case of this man, was it wrong for you to be offended, when
both by what He did, by what He said, He was ever correcting beforehand
this suspicion of yours.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p28">Yet nevertheless, even when these things were said and
done, they prevailed nothing, not even at the very time. At any rate,
he, who was depraved in such great wickedness, and who had spent his
whole life in murders and house-breakings, when these things were being
said, then confessed Him, and made mention of a kingdom, and the people
bewailed Him. And yet the things that were done seemed to testify the
contrary in the eyes of those who knew not the mysterious
dispensations, that He was weak and of no power, nevertheless truth
prevailed even by the contrary things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p29">Hearing then these things, let us arm ourselves against
all rage, against all anger. Shouldest thou perceive thy heart
swelling, seal thy breast setting upon it the cross. Call to mind some
one of the things that then took place, and thou wilt cast out as dust
all rage by the recollection of the things that were done. Consider the
words, the actions; consider that He is Lord, and thou servant. He is
suffering for thee, thou for thyself; He in behalf of them who had been
benefited by Him and had crucified Him, thou in behalf of thyself; He
in behalf of them who had used Him despitefully, thou oftentimes at the
hands of them who have been injured. He in the sight of the whole city,
or rather of the whole people of the Jews, both strangers, and those of
the country, before whom He spake those merciful words, but thou in the
presence of few; and what was more insulting to Him, that even His
disciples forsook Him. For those, who before paid Him attention, had
deserted Him, but His enemies and foes, having got Him in the midst of
themselves on the cross, insulted, reviled, mocked, derided, scoffed at
Him, Jews and soldiers from below, from above thieves on either side:
for indeed the thieves insulted, and upbraided Him both of them. How
then saith Luke that one “rebuked?”<note n="3102" id="iii.LXXXIII-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIII-p30"><scripRef passage="Luke xxiii. 40" id="iii.LXXXIII-p30.1" parsed="|Luke|23|40|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Luke.23.40">Luke xxiii.
40</scripRef>.</p></note> Both things were done, for at first both upbraided Him, but afterwards
one did so no more. For that thou mightest not think the thing had been
done by any agreement, or that the thief was not a thief, by his
insolence he showeth thee, that up on the cross he was a thief and an
enemy, and at once was changed.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p31">Considering then all these things, control thyself. For
what sufferest thou like what thy Lord suffered? Wast thou publicly
insulted? But not like these things. Art thou mocked? yet not thy whole
body, not being thus scourged, and stripped. And even if thou wast
buffeted, yet not like this.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p32">3. And add to this, I pray thee, by whom, and wherefore,
and when, and who it was; and (the most grievous matter) that these
things being done, no one found fault, no one blamed what was done, but
on the contrary all rather approved, and joined in mocking Him and in
jeering at Him; and as a boaster, impostor, and deceiver, and not able
to prove in His works the things that He said, so did they revile Him.
But He held His peace to all, preparing for us the most powerful
incentives to long suffering.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p33">But we, though hearing such things, are not patient so
much as to servants, but we rush and kick worse than wild asses, with
respect to injuries against ourselves, being savage and inhuman; but of
those against God not making much account. And with

<pb n="499" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_499.html" id="iii.LXXXIII-Page_499" />

respect to friends too we have the same
disposition; should any one vex us, we bear it not; should he insult
us, we are savage more than wild beasts, we who are reading these
things every day. A disciple betrayed Him, the rest forsook Him and
fled, they that had been benefited by Him spat at Him, the servants of
the high priest smote Him with the palm of the hand, the soldiers
buffeted Him; they that passed by jeered Him and reviled Him, the
thieves accused Him; and to no man did He utter a word, but by silence
overcame all; instructing thee by His actions, that the more meekly
thou shalt endure, the more wilt thou prevail over them that do thee
evil, and wilt be an object of admiration before all. For who will not
admire him that endures with forbearance the insults he receives from
them that are using him despitefully? For even as, though any man
suffer justly, yet enduring the evil meekly, he is considered by the
more part to suffer unjustly; so though one suffer unjustly, yet if he
be violent, he will get the suspicion of suffering justly, and will be
an object of ridicule, as being dragged captive by his anger, and
losing his own nobility. For such a one, we must not call so much as a
freeman, though he be lord over ten thousand servants.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p34">But did some person exceedingly provoke thee? And what
of that? For then should self-control be shown, since when there is no
one to vex, we see even the wild beasts gentle; for neither are they
always savage, but when any one rouses them. And we therefore, if we
are only then quiet, when there is no one provoking us, what advantage
have we over them. For they are both oftentimes justly indignant, and
have much excuse, for by being stirred and goaded are they roused, and
besides these things they are devoid of reason, and have savageness in
their nature.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p35">But whence, I pray thee, canst thou find a plea for
being savage and fierce? What hardship hast thou suffered? Hast thou
been robbed? For this self-same reason shouldest thou endure it, so as
to gain more amply. But wast thou deprived of character? And what is
this? Thy condition is in no way worsened by this, if thou practise
self-command. But if thou sufferest no grievance, whence art thou angry
with him that hath done thee no harm, but hath even benefited thee? For
they who honor, make them that are not watchful the more vain; but they
who insult and despise render those that take heed to themselves more
steadfast. For the careless are more injured by being honored than by
being insulted. And the one set of persons, if we be sober, become to
us authors of self-control, but the others excite our pride, they fill
us with boastfulness, vainglory, folly, they make our soul the
feebler.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p36">And to this fathers bear witness, who do not flatter
their own children so much as they chide them, fearing lest from the
praise they should receive any harm, and their teachers use the same
remedy to them. So that if we are to avoid any one, it should be those
that flatter us rather than those that insult us; for this bait brings
greater mischief than insult to them, who do not take heed, and it is
more difficult to control this feeling than that. And the reward too is
far more abundant from thence, and the admiration greater. For indeed
it is more worthy of admiration to see a man insulted, and not moved,
than beaten and smitten, and not falling.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p37">And how is it possible not to be moved? one may say.
Hath any one insulted thee? Place the sign upon thy breast, call to
mind all the things that were then done; and all is quenched. Consider
not the insults only, but if also any good hath been ever done unto
thee, by him that hath insulted thee, and straightway thou wilt become
meek, or rather consider before all things the fear of God, and soon
thou wilt be mild and gentle.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p38">4. Together with these things even from thine own
servants take a lesson concerning these matters; and when thou seest
thyself insulting, but thy servant holding his peace, consider that it
is possible to practise self-control, and condemn thyself for being
violent; and in the very time of offering insults learn not to insult;
and thus not even when insulted, wilt thou be vexed. Consider that he
who is insolent is beside himself and mad, and thou wilt not feel
indignant, when insulted, since the possessed strike us, and we, so far
from being provoked, do rather pity them. This do thou also; pity him
that is insolent to thee, for he is held in subjection by a dreadful
monster, rage, by a grievous demon, anger. Set him free as he is
wrought upon by a grievous demon, and going quickly to ruin. For so
great is this disease as not to need even time for the destruction of
him that is seized with it. Wherefore also one said, “The sway of
his fury shall be his fall;”<note n="3103" id="iii.LXXXIII-p38.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIII-p39"><scripRef passage="Ecclesiasticus 1.22" id="iii.LXXXIII-p39.1" parsed="|Sir|1|22|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Sir.1.22">Ecclus. i. 22</scripRef>.</p></note>by this most of all showing its tyranny, that in a short time it works
great ills, and needs not to continue long with us, so that if in
addition to its strength it were apt to last, it would indeed be hard
to strive against.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p40">I should like to show what the man is who insulteth,
what he that practises self-control, and to bring nakedly before you
the soul of

<pb n="500" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_500.html" id="iii.LXXXIII-Page_500" />

the one and the other.
For thou shouldest see the one like a sea tost with a tempest, but the
other like a harbor free from disturbance. For it is not disturbed by
these evil blasts, but puts them to rest easily. For indeed they who
are insulting, do everything in order to make it sting. When then they
fail of that hope, even they are thenceforth at peace, and go away
amended. For it is impossible that a man, who is angry, should not
utterly condemn himself, even as on the other hand it is impossible for
one who is not angry to be self-condemned. For though it be necessary
to retaliate, it is possible to do this without anger (and it were more
easy and more wise than with anger) and to have no painful feeling. For
if we be willing, the good things will be from ourselves, and we shall
be with the grace of God sufficient for our own safety and honor.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p41">For why seekest thou the glory that cometh from another?
Do thou honor thyself, and no one will be able to insult thee; but if
thou dishonor thyself, though all should honor thee, thou wilt not be
honored. For like as, unless we put ourselves in an evil state, no one
else puts us in such a state; even so unless we insult ourselves, no
one else can put us to shame.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p42">For let any man be great and worthy of admiration, and
let all men call him an adulterer, a thief, a violater of tombs, a
murderer, a robber, and let him be neither provoked or indignant, nor
be conscious to himself of any of these crimes, what disgrace will he
thence undergo? None. What then, you may say, if many have such an
opinion of him? Not even so is he disgraced, but they bring shame upon
themselves, by accounting one, who is not such, to be such. For tell
me, if any one think the sun to be dark, doth he bring an ill name on
that heavenly body, or on himself? Surely on himself, getting himself
the character of being blind or mad. So also they that account wicked
men good, and they that make the opposite error, disgrace
themselves.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIII-p43">Wherefore we ought to give the greater diligence, to
keep our conscience clear, and to give no handle against ourselves, nor
matter for evil suspicion; but if others will be mad, even when this is
our disposition, not to care very much, nor to grieve. For he that hath
got the character of a wicked man, being a good man, is in no degree
thereby hurt as regards his being such as he is; but he that hath been
suspecting another vainly and causelessly, receives the utmost harm;
as, on the other hand, the wicked man, if he be supposed to be the
contrary, will gain nothing thence, but will both have a heavier
judgment, and be led into greater carelessness. For he that is such and
is suspected thereof, may perhaps be humbled, and acknowledge his sins;
but when he escapes detection, he falls into a state past feeling. For
if, while all are accusing them, offenders are hardly stirred up to
compunction, when so far from accusing them, some even praise them, at
what time will they who are living in vice be able to open their eyes?
Hearest thou that Paul also blames for this, that the Corinthians (so
far from permitting him that had been guilty of fornication, to
acknowledge his own sin), applauding and honoring him, did on the
contrary urge him on in vice thereby? Wherefore, I pray, let us leave
the suspicions of the multitude, their insults and their honors, and
let us be diligent about one thing only, that we be conscious to
ourselves of no evil thing, nor insult our own selves. For so both
here, and in the world to come, we shall enjoy much glory, unto which
God grant we all may attain, by the grace and love towards man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

their freedom, the gospel flourished, the word was spread abroad to the
ends of the world; both sea and land, both the inhabited earth and the
desert perpetually proclaim its<note n="3107" id="iii.LXXXIV-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIV-p9">Or, “His.”</p></note>power. These things then He meaneth, and those which took place at the
very time of the crucifixion. For indeed it was much more marvellous
that these things should be done, when He was nailed to the cross, than
when He was walking on earth. And not in this respect only was the
wonder, but because from heaven also was that done which they had
sought, and it was over all the world, which had never before happened,
but in Egypt only, when the passover was to be fulfilled. For indeed
those events were a type of these.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p10">And observe when it took place. At midday, that all that
dwell on the earth may know it, when it was day all over the world;
which was enough to convert them, not by the greatness of the miracle
only, but also by its taking place in due season. For after all their
insulting, and their lawless derision, this is done, when they had let
go their anger, when they had ceased mocking, when they were satiated
with their jeerings, and had spoken all that they were minded; then He
shows the darkness, in order that at least so (having vented their
anger) they may profit by the miracle. For this was more marvellous
than to come down from the cross, that being on the cross He should
work these things. For whether they thought He Himself had done it,
they ought to have believed and to have feared; or whether not He, but
the Father, yet thereby ought they to have been moved to compunction,
for that darkness was a token of His anger at their crime. For that it
was not an eclipse, but both wrath and indignation, is not hence alone
manifest, but also by the time, for it continued three hours, but an
eclipse takes place in one moment of time, and they know it, who have
seen this; and indeed it hath taken place even in our generation.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p11">And how, you may say, did not all marvel, and account
Him to be God? Because the race of man was then held in a state of
great carelessness and vice. And this miracle was but one, and when it
had taken place, immediately passed away; and no one was concerned to
inquire into the cause of it, and great was the prejudice and the habit
of ungodliness. And they knew not what was the cause of that which took
place, and they thought perhaps this happened so, in the way of an
eclipse or some natural effect. And why dost thou marvel about them
that are without, that knew nothing, neither inquired by reason of
great indifference, when even those that were in Judæa itself,
after so many miracles, yet continued using Him despitefully, although
He plainly showed them that He Himself wrought this thing.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p12">And for this reason, even after this He speaks, that
they might learn that He was

one on touching a dead body rose again, but now by a voice He raised
them, His body continuing up there, on the cross. And besides, those
things were a type of this. For that this might be believed, therefore
is that all done. And they are not merely raised, but also rocks are
rent, and the earth shaken, that they might learn, that He was able to
strike themselves blind, and to rend them in pieces. For He that cleft
rocks asunder, and darkened the world, much more could have done these
things to them, had it been His will. But He would not, but having
discharged His wrath upon the elements, them it was His will to save by
clemency. But they abated not their madness. Such is envy, such is
jealousy, it is not easily stayed. At that time then they were impudent
in setting themselves against the actual appearances; and afterwards

again, and they heard these things from the very guards; they even gave
money, in order both to corrupt others, and to steal away the history
of the resurrection.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p29">Marvel not therefore if at this time also they were
perverse, being thus altogether prepared to set themselves impudently
against all things; but observe this other point, how great signs He
had wrought, some from Heaven, some on earth, some in the very temple,
at once marking His indignation, and at the same time showing that what
were unapproachable are now to be entered, and that Heaven shall be
opened; and the work removed to the true Holy of Holies. And they
indeed said, “If He be the King of Israel, let Him come down now
from the cross,”<note n="3119" id="iii.LXXXIV-p29.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIV-p30"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 42" id="iii.LXXXIV-p30.1" parsed="|Matt|27|42|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.42">Matt.

bodies of His servants. For if for Lazarus to rise on the fourth day
was a great thing, how much more for all those who had long ago fallen
asleep, at once to appear alive, which was a sign of the future
resurrection. For, “many bodies of the saints which slept,
arose,” it is said, “and went into the holy city, and

smote their breasts, which above all shows the cruelty of the Jews, for
that they gloried in things for which others were lamenting, and were

were done were of great wrath, and were not merely signs, but signs of
anger all of them, the darkness, the cloven rocks, the veil rent in the

however he had become very bold after the death of Christ. For neither
was he an obscure person, nor of the unnoticed; but one of the council,
and highly distinguished; from which circumstance especially one may
see his courage. For he exposed himself to death, taking upon him
enmity with all, by his affection to Jesus, both having dared to beg
the body, and not having desisted until he obtained it. But not by
taking it only, nor by burying it in a costly manner, but also by
laying it in his own new tomb, he showeth his love, and his courage.
And this was not so ordered without purpose, but so there should not be
any bare suspicion, that one had risen instead of another.</p>

as was meet, and high about Him, wherefore also they had brought
ointments, and were waiting at the tomb, so that if the madness of the
Jews should relax, they might go and embrace the body. Seest thou
women’s courage? seest thou their affection? seest thou their
noble spirit in money? their noble spirit even unto death?</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p45">Let us men imitate the women; let us not forsake Jesus
in temptations. For they for Him even dead spent so much and exposed
their lives, but we (for again I say the same things) neither feed Him
when hungry, nor clothe Him when naked, but seeing Him begging, we pass
Him by. And yet if ye saw Himself, every one would strip himself of all
his goods. But even now it is the same. For He Himself has said, I am
he. Wherefore then dost thou not strip thyself of all? For indeed even
now thou hearest Him say, Thou doest it unto me; and there is no
difference whether thou givest to this man or to Him; thou hast nothing
less than these women that then fed Him, but even much more. But be not
perplexed! For it is not so much to have fed Him appearing in His own
person, which would be enough to prevail with a heart of stone, as
(because of His mere word) to wait upon the poor, the maimed, him that
is bent down. For in the former case, the look and the dignity of Him
who appears divides with thee that which is done; but here the reward
is entire for thy benevolence; and there is the proof of the greater
reverence towards Him, when at His mere word waiting upon thy
fellow-servant thou refreshest him in all things. Refresh him, and
believe Him, who receiveth it, and saith, Thou givest to me. For unless
thou hadst given to Him, He would not have counted thee worthy of a
kingdom. If thou

<pb n="504" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_504.html" id="iii.LXXXIV-Page_504" />

hadst not turned
away from Him, He would not have sent thee to hell, if thou hadst
overlooked a chance person; but because it is He Himself that is
despised, therefore great is the blame.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p46">Thus also Paul persecuted Him, in persecuting them that
are His; wherefore too He said, “Why persecutest thou
me?”<note n="3129" id="iii.LXXXIV-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIV-p47"><scripRef passage="Acts ix. 4" id="iii.LXXXIV-p47.1" parsed="|Acts|9|4|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.9.4">Acts ix.
4</scripRef>.</p></note> Thus therefore let us feel, as bestowing on Christ Himself when we
bestow. For indeed His words are more sure than our sight. When
therefore thou seest a poor man, remember His words, by which He
declared, that it is He Himself who is fed. For though that which
appears be not Christ, yet in this man’s form Christ Himself
receiveth and beggeth.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p48">But art thou ashamed to hear that Christ beggeth? Rather
be ashamed when thou dost not give to Him begging of thee. For this is
shame, this is vengeance and punishment. Since for Him to beg is of His
goodness, wherefore we ought even to glory therein; but for thee not to
give, is of thy inhumanity. But if thou believe not now, that in
passing by a poor man that is a believer, thou passest by Him, thou
wilt believe it then, when He will bring thee into the midst and say,
“Inasmuch as ye did it not to these, ye did it not to
me.”<note n="3130" id="iii.LXXXIV-p48.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIV-p49"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxv. 45" id="iii.LXXXIV-p49.1" parsed="|Matt|25|45|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.45">Matt. xxv.

believe now, and bring forth fruit, and hear that most blessed voice
that bringeth us into the kingdom.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p50">But perhaps some one will say, “Thou art every day
discoursing to us of almsgiving and humanity.” Neither will I
cease to speak of this. For if ye had attained to it, in the first
place, not even so ought I to desist, for fear of making you the more
remiss; yet had ye attained, I might have relaxed a little; but if ye
have not arrived even at the half; say not these things to me, but to
yourselves. For indeed thou doest the same in blaming me, as if a
little child, hearing often of the letter alpha, and not learning it,
were to blame its teacher, because he is continually and for ever
reminding him about it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p51">For who from these discourses has become more forward in
the giving of alms? Who has cast down his money? Who has given the half
of his substance? Who the third part? No one. How then should it be
other than absurd, when ye do not learn, to require us to desist from
teaching? Ye ought to do the contrary. Though we were minded to desist,
ye ought to stop us and to say, we have not yet learnt these things,
and how is it ye have desisted from reminding us of them? If it befell
any one to suffer from his eye, and I happened to be a physician, and
then having covered it up and anointed it, and having applied other
treatment, I had not benefited it much, and so had desisted; would he
not have come to the doors of my surgery and cried out against me,
accusing me of great remissness, for that I had of myself withdrawn,
while the disease remained; and if, on being blamed, I had said in
reply to these things, that I had covered it up, and anointed it; would
he have endured it? By no means, but would immediately have said;
“And what is the advantage, if I still suffer pain.” Reason
thus also with respect to thy soul. But what if after having often
fomented a hand that was lifeless and shrunk, I had not succeeded in
mollifying it? Should I not have heard the same thing? And even now a
hand that is shrunk and withered we bathe, and for this reason, until
we can stretch it out perfectly, we will not desist. Would that you too
were to discourse of nothing else, at home and at market, at table and
at night, and as a dream. For if we were always careful about these
things by day, even in our dreams we should be engaged in them.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p52">What sayest thou? Am I forever speaking of almsgiving? I
would wish myself that there were not great need for me to address this
advice to you, but that I were to speak of the battle against the Jews,
and heathens, and heretics; but when ye are not yet sound, how can any
one arm you for the fight? How should he lead you to the array, yet
having wounds and gashes. Since if indeed I saw you thoroughly sound in
health, I should lead you forth to that battle array, and ye would see
by the grace of Christ ten thousands lying dead, and their heads cast
one upon another. In other books at any rate, many discourses have been
spoken by us touching these things, but not even so are we able
thoroughly to triumph in the victory, because of the remissness of the
multitude. For when we conquer them ten thousand times over in
doctrines, they reproach us with the lives of the multitude of those
who join our congregations, their wounds, their diseases in their
soul.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p53">How then shall we with confidence show you in the battle

enemies, and made a mock of? For one man’s hand is diseased, and
shrunk so as not to be able to give away. How then should such a one
hold a shield, and thrust it before him, and avoid being wounded by the
jeers of cruelty. With others the feet halt, as

many as go up to the theatres, and to the
resorts of the harlot women. How shall these then be able to stand in
the battle, and not to be wounded with the accusation of wantonness?
Another suffers and is maimed in his eyes, not looking straight, but
being full of lasciviousness, and assailing women’s chastity, and
overthrowing marriages. How then should this man be able to look in the
face of the enemy, and brandish a spear, and throw his dart, being
goaded on all sides with jeers. We may see also many suffering with the
belly not less than the dropsical, when they are held in subjection by
gluttony and drunkenness. How then shall I be able to lead forth these
drunken men to war? With others the mouth is rotten; such are the
passionate, and revilers, and blasphemers. How then shall this man ever
shout in battle, and achieve anything great and noble, he too being
drunk with another drunkenness, and affording much laughter to the
enemy?</p>

wounds, healing your sores. But if ye ever rouse yourselves up, and
become fit even to wound others, I will both teach you this art of war,
and instruct you how to handle these weapons, or rather your works
themselves will be weapons to you, and all men will immediately submit,
if ye would become merciful, if forbearing, if mild and patient, if ye
would show forth all other virtue. But if any gainsay, then we will
also add the proof of what we can show on our part,<note n="3131" id="iii.LXXXIV-p54.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXIV-p55"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXXIV-p55.1">τ παρ

having made angels of men; then, when we are called upon to give

are stopped. For I am afraid, lest in the place of angels, I bring
forth swine as from a style, and horses mad with lust.</p>

fold for asses and camels, and I go round seeking for a sheep, and am
not able to see it. So much are all kicking, like horses, and any wild

their discourse. And if indeed one could see the things spoken at each

dung.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p59">Wherefore I entreat you to change this evil custom, that
the church may smell of ointment. But now, while we lay up in it
perfumes for the senses, the uncleanness of the mind we use no great
diligence to purge out, and drive away. What then is the advantage? For
we do not so much disgrace the church by bringing dung into it, as we
disgrace it by speaking such things one to another, about gains, about
merchandise, about petty tradings, about things that are nothing to us,
when there ought to be choirs of angels here, and we ought to make the
church a heaven, and to know nothing else but earnest prayers, and
silence with listening.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXIV-p60">This then let us do at any rate, from the present time,
that we may both purify our lives, and attain unto the promised
blessings, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory world without end. Amen.</p>

itself, and against its will supports the truth. And observe. It was
necessary for it to be believed that He died, and that He rose again,
and that He was buried, and all these things are brought to pass by His
enemies. See, at any rate, these words bearing witness to every one of
these facts. “We remember,” these are the words,
“that that deceiver said, when He was yet alive,” (He was
therefore now dead), “After three days I rise again. Command
therefore that the sepulchre be sealed,” (He was therefore
buried), “lest His disciples come and steal Him away.” So
that if the sepulchre be sealed, there will be no unfair dealing. For
there could not be. So then the proof of His resurrection has become
incontrovertible by what ye have put forward. For because it was
sealed, there was no unfair dealing. But if there was no unfair
dealing, and the sepulchre was found empty, it is manifest that He is
risen, plainly and incontrovertibly. Seest thou, how even against their
will they contend for the proof of the truth?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p8">But mark thou, I pray thee, the disciples’ love of
truth, how they conceal from us none of the things that are said by His
enemies, though they use opprobrious language. Behold, at any rate,
they even call Him a deceiver, and these men are not silent about
that.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p9">But these things show also their savageness (that not
even at His death did they let go their anger), and these men’s
simple and truthful disposition.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p10">But it were worth while to inquire concerning that point
also, where He said, “After three days I rise again?” For
one would not find this thus distinctly stated,<note n="3136" id="iii.LXXXV-p10.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p11">Not to the Jews, for it was often plainly declared
to the disciples, as St. Chrysostom himself observes a little further
on.</p></note>but rather the example of Jonah. So that they understood His saying,
and of their own will dealt unfairly.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p12">What then saith Pilate? “Ye have a watch; make it
as sure as ye can. And they made it sure, sealing the sepulchre, and
setting the watch.”<note n="3137" id="iii.LXXXV-p12.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p13"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 65, 66" id="iii.LXXXV-p13.1" parsed="|Matt|27|65|27|66" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.65-Matt.27.66">Matt.

peculiarity is indicated in the above rendering; for “made the
sepulchre sure, sealing the stone.” R.V., “guard” for
“watch,” and “the guard being with
them.”—R.]</p></note> He suffers not the soldiers alone to seal, for as having learnt the
things concerning Christ, he was no longer willing to co-operate with
them. But in order to be rid of them, he endures this also, and saith,
“Do ye seal it as ye will, that ye may not have it in your power
to blame others.” For if the soldiers only had sealed, they might
have said (although the saying would have been improbable and false,
yet nevertheless as in the rest they cast aside shame, so in this too
they might have been able to say), that the soldiers, having given up
the body to be stolen, gave His disciples opportunity to feign the
history concerning His resurrection, but now having themselves made it
sure, they are not able to say so much as this.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p14">Seest thou how they labor for the truth against their
will? For they themselves came to Pilate, themselves asked, themselves
sealed, setting the watch, so as to be accusers, and refuters one of
another. And indeed when should they have stolen Him? on the Sabbath?
And how? for it was not lawful so much as to go out.<note n="3138" id="iii.LXXXV-p14.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p15"><scripRef passage="Exod. xvi. 29" id="iii.LXXXV-p15.1" parsed="|Exod|16|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Exod.16.29">Exod. xvi.

were so timid, to come forth? And how could they also have been able to
persuade the multitude? By saying what? By doing what? And from what
sort of zeal could they have stood in behalf of the dead? expecting

<pb n="507" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_507.html" id="iii.LXXXV-Page_507" />

what recompense? what requital?
Seeing Him yet alive and merely seized, they had fled; and after His
death were they likely to speak boldly in His behalf, unless He had
risen again? And how should these things be reasonable? For that they
were neither willing nor able to feign a resurrection, that did not
take place, is plain from hence. He discoursed to them much of a
resurrection, and continually said, as indeed these very men have
stated, “After three days I rise again.” If therefore He
rose not again, it is quite clear that these men (having been deceived
and made enemies to an entire nation for His sake, and come to be
without home and without city) would have abhorred Him, and would not
have been willing to invest Him with such glory; as having been
deceived, and having fallen into the utmost dangers on His account. For
that they would not even have been able, unless the resurrection had
been true, to feign it, this does not so much as need reasoning.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p16">For in what were they confident? In the shrewdness of
their reasonings? Nay of all men they were the most unlearned. But in
the abundance of their possessions? Nay, they had neither staff nor
shoes. But in the distinction of their race? Nay, they were mean, and
of mean ancestors. But in the greatness of their country? Nay, they
were of obscure places. But in their own numbers? Nay, they were not
more than eleven, and they were scattered abroad. But in their
Master’s promises? What kind of promises? For if He were not
risen again, neither would those be likely to be trusted by them. And
how should they endure a frantic people. For if the chief of them
endured not the speech of a woman, keeping the door, and if all the
rest too, on seeing Him bound, were scattered abroad, how should they
have thought to run to the ends of the earth, and plant a feigned tale
of a resurrection? For if he stood not a woman’s threat, and they
not so much as the sight of bonds, how were they able to stand against
kings, and rulers, and nations, where were swords, and gridirons, and
furnaces, and ten thousand deaths day by day, unless they had the
benefit of the power and grace<note n="3139" id="iii.LXXXV-p16.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p17"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXXV-p17.1">ῥοπ</span>.</p></note>of Him who rose again? Such miracles and so many were done, and none of
these things did the Jews regard, but crucified Him, who had done them,
and were they likely to believe these men at their mere word about a
resurrection? These things are not, they are not so, but the might of
Him, who rose again, brought them to pass.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p18">2. But mark, I pray thee, their craft, how ridiculous it
is. “We remember,” these are their words, “that that
deceiver said, while He was yet alive, After three days I rise
again.” Yet if He were a deceiver, and boastfully uttered
falsehood, why are ye afraid and run to and fro, and use so much
diligence? We are afraid, it is replied, lest perchance the disciples
steal Him away, and deceive the multitude. And yet this has been proved
to have no probability at all. Malice, however, is a thing contentious
and shameless, and attempts what is unreasonable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p19">And they command it to be made sure for three days, as
contending for doctrines, and being minded to prove that before that
time also He was a deceiver, and they extend their malice even to His
tomb. For this reason then He rose sooner, that they might not say that
He spake falsely, and was stolen. For this, His rising sooner, was open
to no charge, but to be later would have been full of suspicion. For
indeed if He had not risen then, when they were sitting there, and
watching, but when they had withdrawn after the three days, they would
have had something to say, and to speak against it, although foolishly.
For this reason then He anticipated the time. For it was meet the
resurrection should take place, while they were sitting by and
watching. Therefore also it was fit it should take place within the
three days, since if it had been when they were passed, and the men had
withdrawn, the matter would have been regarded with suspicion.
Wherefore also He allowed them to seal it, as they were minded, and
soldiers sat around it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p20">And they cared not about doing these things, and working
on a Sabbath day, but they looked to one object only, their own wicked
purpose, as though by that they were to succeed; which was a mark of
extreme folly, and of fear now greatly dismaying them. For they who
seized Him, when living, are afraid of Him when dead. And yet if He had
been a mere man, they had reason to have taken courage. But that they
might learn, that when living also He endured of His own will, what He
did endure; behold, both a seal, a stone, and a watch, and they were
not able to hold Him. But there was one result only, that the burial
was published, and the resurrection thereby proved. For indeed soldiers
sat by it, and Jews are on the watch.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p25">After the resurrection came the angel. Wherefore then
came he, and took away the stone? Because of the women, for they

sepulchre void of the body. For this cause he removed the stone, for
this cause also an earthquake took place, that they might be thoroughly
aroused and awakened. For they were come to pour oil on Him, and these
things were done at night, and it is likely that some also had become
drowsy. And for what intent and cause doth he say, “Fear not
ye?”<note n="3144" id="iii.LXXXV-p26.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p27"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxviii. 5" id="iii.LXXXV-p27.1" parsed="|Matt|28|5|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.28.5">Matt.

resurrection. And the ye is of one showing them great honor, and
indicating, that extreme punishment awaits them that had dared to do,
what the others had dared, except they repented. For to be afraid is
not for you, he means, but for them that crucified Him.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p28">Having delivered them then from the fear both by his
words, and by his appearance (for his form he showed bright, as bearing
such good tidings), he went on to say, “I know that ye seek Jesus

of all made them believe. And He said well “in Galilee,”
freeing them from troubles and dangers, so that fear should not hinder
their faith.</p>

“great” is omitted.—R.]</p></note> Why could this be? They had seen a thing amazing, and beyond
expectation, a tomb empty, where they had before seen Him laid.
Wherefore also He had led them to the sight, that they might become
witnesses of both things, both of His tomb, and of His resurrection.
For they considered that no man could have taken Him, when so many
soldiers were sitting by Him, unless He raised up Himself. For this
cause also they rejoice and wonder, and receive the reward of so much
continuance with Him, that they should first see and gladly declare,
not what had been said only, but also what they beheld.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p36">3. Therefore after then they had departed with fear and
joy, “Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail.” But

touch also, an infallible proof, and full assurance of the
resurrection. “And they worshipped Him.” What then saith
He? “Be not afraid.” Again, He Himself casts out their
fear, making way for faith, “But go, tell my brethren, that they
go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.”<note n="3151" id="iii.LXXXV-p37.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p38"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxviii. 10" id="iii.LXXXV-p38.1" parsed="|Matt|28|10|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.28.10">Matt.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p39">Perchance some one of you would wish to be like them, to
hold the feet of Jesus; ye can even now, and not His feet and His hands

mysteries with a pure conscience. But not here only, but also in that
day ye shall see Him, coming with that unspeakable glory, and the
multitude of the angels, if ye are disposed to be humane; and ye shall
hear not these words only, “All hail!” but also those
others, “Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p41">Be ye therefore humane, that ye may hear these things;
and ye women, that wear gold, who have looked on the running of these
women, at last, though late, lay aside the disease of the desire for
golden ornaments. So that if ye are emulous of these women, change the
ornaments which ye wear, and clothe yourselves instead with almsgiving.
What is the use, I pray you, of these precious stones, and of the
garments spangled with gold? “My soul,” you say, “is
glad, and is pleased with these things.” I asked thee the profit,
but thou tellest me the hurt. For nothing is

worse than being taken up with these things,
and delighting in them, and being riveted to them. For more bitter is
this grievous slavery, when any one finds delight even in being a
slave. For in what spiritual matter will she ever be diligent as she
ought; when will she laugh to scorn, as she should, the things of this
world, who thinks it a worthy matter for joy, that she hath been
chained in gold? For he that continues in prison, and is pleased, will
never desire to be set free; as indeed neither will this woman; but as
having become a kind of captive to this wicked desire, she will not
endure so much as to hear spiritual language with becoming desire and
diligence, much less to engage in such work.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p42">What then is the profit of these ornaments and this
luxury? I pray thee. “I am pleased with them,” thou sayest.
Again thou hast told of the hurt and the ruin. “But I enjoy
also,” thou sayest, “much honor from the beholders.”
And what is this? This is the occasion of another destruction, when
thou art lifted up to haughtiness, to arrogance. Come now, since thou
hast not told me of the profit, bear with me while I tell thee of the
mischiefs. What then are the mischiefs resulting therefrom? Anxiety,
which is greater than the pleasure. Wherefore many of the beholders,
these I mean of the grosser sort, derive more pleasure from it than she
who wears the gold. For thou indeed deckest thyself with anxiety, but
they, without this, feast their eyes.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p43">Moreover, there are other things again, the debasing of
the soul, the being looked upon with envy on all sides. For the
neighboring women stung by it, arm themselves against their own
husbands, and stir up against thee grievous wars. Together with these
things, the fact that all one’s leisure and anxiety are spent on
this object, that one doth not apply one’s self earnestly to
spiritual achievements; that one is filled with haughtiness, arrogance,
and vainglory; that one is riveted to the earth, and loses one’s
wings, and instead of an eagle, becometh a dog or a swine. For having
given up looking up into Heaven, and flying thither, thou bendest down
to the earth like the swine, being curious about mines and caverns, and
having an unmanly and base soul. But dost thou, when thou appearest,
turn towards thee the eyes of them at the market-place? Well then; for
this very reason, thou shouldest not wear gold, that thou mayest not
become a common gazing stock, and open the mouths of many accusers. For
none of those whose eyes are toward thee admireth thee, but they jeer
at thee, as fond of dress, as boastful, as a carnal woman. And
shouldest thou enter into a church, thou goest forth, without getting
anything but countless leers, and revilings, and curses, not from the
beholders only, but also from the prophet. For straightway Isaiah,<note n="3153" id="iii.LXXXV-p43.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p44"><scripRef passage="Isa. iii. 16, 24" id="iii.LXXXV-p44.1" parsed="|Isa|3|16|0|0;|Isa|3|24|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Isa.3.16 Bible:Isa.3.24">Isa. iii.

cry out, “These things saith the Lord against the princely
daughters of Sion; because they walked with a lofty neck, and with
winkings of the eyes, and in their walking, trailing their garments,
and mincing at the same time with their feet; the Lord shall take off
their bravery, and instead of a sweet smell there shall be dust, and
instead of a stomacher, thou shalt gird thyself with a cord.”<note n="3154" id="iii.LXXXV-p44.3"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p45"><scripRef passage="1 Tim. ii. 9" id="iii.LXXXV-p45.1" parsed="|1Tim|2|9|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Tim.2.9">1 Tim. ii.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p46">These things for thy gorgeous array. For not to them
only are these words addressed, but to every woman that doeth like
them. And Paul again with him stands as an accuser, telling Timothy to
charge the women, “not to adorn themselves with braided hair, or
gold, or pearls, or costly array.”<note n="3155" id="iii.LXXXV-p46.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p47"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXXV-p47.1">εσαγωγα</span>.</p></note> So that everywhere the wearing of gold is hurtful, but especially when
thou art entering into a church, when thou passest through the poor.
For if thou wert exceedingly anxious to bring an accusation against
thyself, thou couldest not put on any other array than this visage of
cruelty and inhumanity.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p48">4. Consider at any rate how many hungry bellies thou
passest by with this array, how many naked bodies with this satanical
display. How much better to feed hungry souls, than to bore through the
lobes of thy ears, and to hang from them the food of countless poor for
no purpose or profit. What? is to be rich a commendation? What? is to
wear gold a praise? Though it be from honest earnings that these things
are put on you, even so what thou hast done is a very heavy charge
against thee; but when it is moreover from dishonesty, consider the
exceeding greatness of it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p49">But dost thou love praises and honor? Strip thyself
therefore of this ridiculous clothing, and then all will admire thee;
then shalt thou enjoy both honor and pure pleasure; since now at any
rate thou art overwhelmed with jeers, working for thyself many causes
of vexation arising out of these things. For should any of these things
be missing, consider how many are the evils that have their birth
therefrom, how many maidservants are beaten, how many men put to
trouble, how many led to execution, how many cast into prison. And
trials arise hence, and actions, and countless curses and accusations
against the wife from the husband, against the hus

band from her friends, against the soul from
itself. “But it will not be lost.” In the first place, this
is not easy to secure, but even if it be kept safe constantly, yet by
being kept, it occasions much anxiety and care and discomfort, and no
advantage.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p50">For what kind of profit arises from hence to the house?
What advantage to the woman herself who wears it? No advantage indeed,
but much unseemliness, and accusation from every quarter? How wilt thou
be able to kiss Christ’s feet, and cling to them, when thus
dressed? From this adorning He turneth away. For this cause He
vouchsafed to be born in the house of the carpenter, or rather not even
in that house, but in a shed, and a manger. How then wilt thou be able
to behold Him, not having beauty that is desirable in His eyes, not
wearing the array that is lovely before Him, but what is hateful. For
he that cometh unto Him must not deck himself out with such garments,
but be clothed with virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p51">Consider what after all these jewels are. Nothing else
than earth and ashes. Mix water with them, and they are clay. Consider
and be ashamed to make clay thy master, forsaking all, and abiding by
it, and carrying and bearing it about, even when thou enterest into a
church, when most of all thou oughtest to flee from it. For neither for
this cause was the church built, that thou shouldest display therein
these riches, but spiritual riches. But thou, as though thou wert
entering into a pompous procession, thus deckest thyself out on every
side, imitating the women on the stage, even so dost thou carry about
in profusion that ridiculous mass.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p52">Therefore, I tell thee, thou comest for mischief to
many, and when the congregation is dismissed, in their houses, at their
tables, one may hear the more part describing these things. For they
have left off saying, thus and thus said the prophet and the apostle,
and they describe the costliness of your garments, the size of your
precious stones, and all the other unseemliness of them that wear these
things.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p53">This makes you backward in almsgiving, and your
husbands. For one of you would not readily consent to break up one of
these ornaments to feed a poor man. For when thou wouldest choose even
thyself to be in distress rather than to behold these things broken to
pieces, how shouldest thou feed another at the cost of them?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p54">For most women feel towards these things, as to some
living beings, and not less than towards their children. “God
forbid,” thou sayest. Prove me this then, prove it by your works,
as now at least I see the contrary. For who ever of those that are
completely taken captive, by melting down these things, would rescue a
child’s soul from death? And why do I say a child’s? Who
hath redeemed his own soul thereby, when perishing? Nay, on the
contrary, the more part even set it to sale for these things every day.
And should any bodily infirmity take place, they do everything, but if
they see their soul depraved, they take no such pains, but are careless
both about their children’s soul, and their own soul, in order
that these things may remain to rust with time.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p55">And whilst thou art wearing jewels worth ten thousand
talents, the member of Christ hath not the enjoyment so much as of
necessary food. And whereas the common Lord of all hath imparted to all
alike of heaven, and of the things in Heaven, and of the spiritual
table, thou dost not impart to Him even of perishing things, on purpose
that thou mayest continue perpetually bound with these grievous
chains.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXV-p56">Hence the countless evils,<note n="3156" id="iii.LXXXV-p56.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p57">[The Oxford translator inserts here “hence the
jealousies,” but there is no corresponding phrase in the Greek
text.—R.]</p></note>hence the fornications of the men, when ye prepare them to cast off
self-restraint, when ye teach them to take delight in these things with
which the harlot women deck themselves. For this cause they are so
quickly taken captive. For if thou hadst instructed him to look down
upon these things, and to take delight in chastity, godly fear and
humility, he would not have been so easily taken by the shafts<note n="3157" id="iii.LXXXV-p57.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXV-p58"><span lang="EL" class="Greek" id="iii.LXXXV-p58.1">πτερο</span>.</p></note>of fornication. For the harlot is able to adorn herself in this way
even to a greater degree than this, but with those other ornaments not
so. Accustom him then to take delight in these ornaments, which he
cannot see placed on the harlot. And how wilt thou bring him into this
habit? If thou take off these, and put on those others, so shall both
thy husband be in safety, and thou in honor, and God will be propitious
to you, and all men will admire you, and ye will attain unto the good
things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and might, world without end. Amen.</p>

that earthquake took place, in order to dismay them, and that the
testimony might come from them, which accordingly was the result. For
the report was thus free from suspicion, as proceeding from the guards
themselves. For of the signs some were displayed publicly to the world,
others privately to those present on the spot; publicly for the world
was the darkness, privately the appearance of the angel, the
earthquake. When then they came and showed it (for truth shines forth,
being proclaimed by its adversaries), they again gave money, that they
might say, as it is expressed, “that His disciples came and stole
Him.”</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p7">How did they steal Him? O most foolish of all men! For
because of the clearness and conspicuousness of the truth, they are not
even able to make up a falsehood. For indeed what they said was highly
incredible, and the falsehood had not even speciousness. For how, I
ask, did the disciples steal Him, men poor and unlearned, and not
venturing so much as to show themselves? What? was not a seal put upon
it? What? were there not so many watchmen, and soldiers, and Jews
stationed round it? What? did not those men suspect this very thing,
and take thought, and break their rest, and continue anxious about it?
And wherefore moreover did they steal it? That they might feign the
doctrine of the resurrection? And how should it enter their minds to
feign such a thing, men who were well content to be hidden and to live?
And how could they remove the stone that was made sure? how could they
have escaped the observation of so many? Nay, though they had despised
death, they would not have attempted without purpose, and fruitlessly
to venture in defiance of so many who were on the watch. And that
moreover they were timorous, what they had done before showed clearly,
at least, when they saw Him seized, all rushed away from Him. If then
at that time they did not dare so much as to stand their ground when
they saw Him alive, how when He was dead could they but have feared
such a number of soldiers? What? was it to burst open a door? Was it
that one should escape notice? A great stone lay upon it, needing many
hands to move it.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p8">They were right in saying, “So the last error
shall be worse than the first,”<note n="3160" id="iii.LXXXVI-p8.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXVI-p9"><scripRef passage="Matt. xxvii. 64" id="iii.LXXXVI-p9.1" parsed="|Matt|27|64|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.27.64">Matt.

much mad conduct they ought to have repented, they rather strive to
outdo their former acts, feigning absurd fictions, and as, when He was
alive, they purchased His blood, so when He was dead and risen again,
they again by money were striving to undermine the evidence of His
resurrection. But do thou mark, I pray thee, how by their own doings
they are caught everywhere. For if they had not come to Pilate, nor
asked for the guard, they would have been more able to act thus
impudently, but as it was, not so. For indeed, as though they were
laboring to stop their own mouths, even so did they all things. For if
the disciples had not strength to watch with Him, and that, though
upbraided by Him, how could they have ventured upon these things? And
wherefore did they not steal Him before this, but when ye were come?
For if they had been minded to do this, they would have done it, when
the tomb was not yet guarded on the first night, when it was to be done
without danger, and in security. For it was on the Sabbath that they
came and begged of Pilate to have the watch, and kept guard, but during
the first night none of these was present by the sepulchre.</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p10">2. And what mean also the napkins that were stuck on
with the myrrh; for Peter saw these lying. For if they had been
disposed to steal, they would not have stolen the body

naked, not because of dishonoring it only, but
in order not to delay and lose time in stripping it, and not to give
them that were so disposed opportunity to awake and seize them.
Especially when it was myrrh, a drug that adheres so to the body, and
cleaves to the clothes, whence it was not easy to take the clothes off
the body, but they that did this needed much time, so that from this
again, the tale of the theft is improbable.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p11">What? did they not know the rage of the Jews? and that
they would vent their anger on them? And what profit was it at all to
them, if He had not risen again?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p12">So these men, being conscious that they had made up all
this tale, gave money, and said, “Say ye these things, and we
will persuade the governor.” For they desire that the report
should be published, fighting in vain against the truth; and by their
endeavors to obscure it, by these even against their will they
occasioned it to appear clearly. For indeed even this establishes the
resurrection, the fact I mean of their saying, that the disciples stole
Him. For this is the language of men confessing, that the body was not
there. When therefore they confess the body was not there, but the
stealing it is shown to be false and incredible, by their watching by
it, and by the seals, and by the timidity of the disciples, the proof
of the resurrection even hence appears incontrovertible.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p13">Nevertheless, these shameless and audacious men,
although there were so many things to stop their mouths, “Say
ye,” these are their words, “and we will persuade, and will
secure you.” Seest thou all depraved? Pilate, for he was
persuaded? the soldiers? the Jewish people? But marvel not, if money
prevailed over soldiers. For if with His disciple it showed its might
to be so great, much more with these.</p>

mountains asunder? to fly into the air? or to cross the Tuscan sea? By
no means, but a way of life so easy, as not so much as to want any
instruments, but a soul and purpose only. For what instruments had
these apostles, who effected such things? Did they not go about with
one vestment and unshod? and they got the better of all.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p30">For what is difficult of the injunctions? Have no enemy.
Hate no man. Speak ill of no man. Nay, the opposites of these things
are the greater hardships. But He said, you reply, Throw away thy
money. Is this then the grievous thing? In the first place, He did not
command, but advised it. Yet even if it were a command, what is it
grievous not to carry about burdens and unseasonable cares?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p31">But oh covetousness! All things are become money; for
this cause all things are turned upside down. If anyone declares
another happy, he mentions this; should he pronounce him wretched,
hence is derived the description of wretchedness. And all reckonings
are made on this account, how such an one gets rich, how such an one
gets poor. Should it be military service, should it be marriage, should
it be a trade, should it be what you will that any man takes in hand,
he does not apply to what is proposed, until he see these riches are
coming in rapidly upon him. After this shall we not meet together and
consult how we shall drive away this pest? Shall we not regard with
shame the good deeds of our fathers? of the three thousand, of the five
thousand, who had all things common?</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p32">What is the profit of this present life, when we do not
use it for our future gain? How long do ye not enslave the mammon that
hath enslaved you? How long are ye slaves of money? How long have ye no
love for liberty, and do not rend in pieces the bargains of
covetousness? But while, if ye should have become slaves of men, you do
all things, if any one should promise you liberty; yet being captives
of covetousness, ye do not so much as consider how ye may be delivered
from this bitter bondage. And yet the one were nothing terrible, the
other is the most bitter tyranny.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p33">Consider how great a price Christ paid for us. He shed
His own blood; He gave up Himself. But ye, even after all this, are
grown supine; and the most grievous thing of all is, that ye even take
delight in the slavery, ye luxuriate in the dishonor, and that, from
which ye ought to flee, is become an object of desire to you.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p34">But since it is right not only to lament and to blame,
but also to correct, let us see from what cause this passion and this
evil have become an object of desire to you. Whence then, whence hath
this come to be an object of desire? Because, thou sayest, it makes me
to be in honor and in security. In what kind of security, I pray thee?
In the confidence, not to suffer hunger, nor cold, not to be harmed,
not to be despised. Wilt thou then, if we promise thee this security,
refrain from being rich? For if it is for this that riches are an
object of desire, if it be in your power to have security without
these, what need hast thou of these any more? “And how is it
possible,” thou sayest, “for one who is not rich to attain
to this?” Nay, how is it possible (for I say the opposite thing)
if one is rich? For it is necessary to flatter many, both rulers and
subjects, and to entreat countless numbers, and to be a base slave, and
to be in fear and trembling, and to regard with suspicion the eyes of
the envious, and to fear the tongues of false accusers, and the desires
of other covetous men. But poverty is not like this, but altogether the
contrary. It is a place of refuge and security, a calm harbor, a
wrestling ground, and school of exercise to learn self-command, an
imitation of the life of angels.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p35">Hear these things, as many as are poor; or rather also,
as many as desire to be rich. It is not poverty that is the thing to be
feared, but the not being willing to be poor. Account poverty to be
nothing to fear, and it will not be to thee a matter for fear. For
neither is this fear in the nature of the thing, but in the judgment of
feeble-minded men. Or rather, I am even ashamed that I have occasion to
say so much concerning poverty, to show that it is nothing to be
feared. For if thou practise self-command, it is even a fountain to
thee of countless blessings. And if any one were to offer thee
sovereignty, and political power, and wealth, and luxury, and then
having set against them poverty, were to give thee thy choice to take
which thou

<pb n="514" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_514.html" id="iii.LXXXVI-Page_514" />

wouldest, thou wouldest
straightway seize upon poverty, if indeed thou knewest the beauty
thereof.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p36">4. And I know that many laugh, when these things are
said; but we are not troubled but we require you to stay, and soon ye
will give judgment with us. For to me poverty seems like some comely,
fair, and well-favored damsel, but covetousness like some monster
shaped woman, some Scylla or Hydra, or some other like prodigies
feigned by fabulous writers.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p37">For bring not forward, I pray thee, them that accuse
poverty, but them that have shone thereby. Nurtured in this, Elias was
caught up in that blessed assumption. With this Eliseus shone; with
this John; with this all the apostles; but with the other, Ahab,
Jezebel, Gehazi, Judas, Nero, Caiaphas, were condemned.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p38">But if it please you, let us not look to those only that
have been glorious in poverty, but let us observe the beauty itself of
this damsel. For indeed her eye is clear and piercing, having nothing
turbid in it, like the eye of covetousness, which is at one time full
of anger, at another sated with pleasure, at another troubled by
incontinence. But the eye of poverty is not like this, but mild, calm,
looking kindly on all, meek, gentle, hating no man, shunning no man.
For where there are riches, there is matter for enmity, and for
countless wars. The mouth again of the other is full of insults, of a
certain haughtiness, of much boasting, cursing, deceit; but the mouth
and the tongue of this are sound, filled with continual thanksgiving,
blessing, words of gentleness, of affection, of courtesy, of praise, of
commendation. And if thou wouldest see also the proportion of her
members, she is of a goodly height, and far loftier than wealth. And if
many flee from her, marvel not at it, for indeed so do fools from the
rest of virtue.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p39">But the poor man, thou wilt say, is insulted by him that
is rich. Again thou art declaring to me the praise of poverty. For who,
I pray thee, is blessed, the insulter, or the insulted? It is manifest
that it is the insulted person. But then, the one, covetousness, urges
to insult the other; poverty persuades to endure. “But the poor
man suffers hunger,” thou wilt say. Paul also suffered hunger,
and was in famine.<note n="3169" id="iii.LXXXVI-p39.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXVI-p40"><scripRef passage="1 Cor. iv. 11; 2 Cor. xi. 27; Phil. iv. 12" id="iii.LXXXVI-p40.1" parsed="|1Cor|4|11|0|0;|2Cor|11|27|0|0;|Phil|4|12|0|0" osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.11 Bible:2Cor.11.27 Bible:Phil.4.12">1 Cor. iv.

</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p42">Seest thou how far the praises of poverty have
proceeded, and where it places thee, to what men it leads thee on, and
how it makes thee a follower of the Lord? If it were good to have gold,
Christ, who have the unutterable blessings, would have given this to
His disciples. But now so far from giving it them, He forbad them to
have it. Wherefore Peter also, so far from being ashamed of poverty,
even glories in it, saying, “Silver and gold have I none; but
what I have give I thee.”<note n="3171" id="iii.LXXXVI-p42.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXVI-p43"><scripRef passage="Acts iii. 6" id="iii.LXXXVI-p43.1" parsed="|Acts|3|6|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Acts.3.6">Acts iii.

would extremely, perhaps some one may say. Then throw away thy silver,
throw away thy gold. “And if I throw it away, thou wilt say,
shall I receive the power of Peter?” Why, what made Peter
blessed, tell me? Was it indeed to have lifted up the lame man? By no
means, but the not having these riches, this procured him Heaven. For
of those that wrought these miracles, many fell into hell, but they,
who did those good things, attained a kingdom. And this you may learn
even of Peter himself. For there were two things that he said,
“Silver and gold have I none;” and, “In the name of
Jesus Christ rise up and walk.”</p>
 
<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p44">Which sort of thing then made Him glorious and blessed,
the raising up the lame man, or the casting away his money? And this
you may learn from the Master of the conflicts Himself. What then doth
He Himself say to the rich man seeking eternal life? He said not,
“raise up the lame,” but, “Sell thy goods, and give
to the poor, and come and follow me, and thou shalt have treasure in
Heaven.”<note n="3172" id="iii.LXXXVI-p44.1"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXVI-p45"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 21" id="iii.LXXXVI-p45.1" parsed="|Matt|19|21|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.21">Matt. xix.

devils;” although he was casting them out, but, “Behold, we
have forsaken all and followed Thee what shall we have?”<note n="3173" id="iii.LXXXVI-p45.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXVI-p46"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 27" id="iii.LXXXVI-p46.1" parsed="|Matt|19|27|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.27">Matt. xix.

man raise up the lame,” but, “Whosoever hath forsaken
houses or lands, shall receive an hundredfold in this world, and shall
inherit everlasting life.”<note n="3174" id="iii.LXXXVI-p46.2"><p class="endnote" id="iii.LXXXVI-p47"><scripRef passage="Matt. xix. 29" id="iii.LXXXVI-p47.1" parsed="|Matt|19|29|0|0" osisRef="Bible:Matt.19.29">Matt. xix.

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p48">Let us also then emulate this man, that we may not be
confounded, but may with confidence stand at the judgment seat of
Christ; that we may win Him to be with us, even as He was with His
disciples. For He will be with us, like as He was with them, if we are
willing to follow them, and to be imitators of their life and
conversation. For in consequence of these things God crowns, and
commends men, not requiring of thee to raise the dead, or to cure the
lame. For not these things make one to be like Peter, but the

<pb n="515" href="/ccel/schaff/npnf110/Page_515.html" id="iii.LXXXVI-Page_515" />

casting away one’s goods, for this
was the apostles’ achievement.</p>

<p class="c13" id="iii.LXXXVI-p49">But dost thou not find it possible to cast them away? In
the first place, I say, it is possible; but I compel thee not, if thou
art not willing, nor constrain thee to it; but this I entreat, to spend
at least a part on the needy, and to seek for thyself nothing more than
is necessary. For thus shall we both live our life here without
trouble, and in security, and enjoy eternal life; unto which God grant
we all may attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and might, together with the Father and the
Holy Ghost, now and always, and world without end. Amen.</p>
