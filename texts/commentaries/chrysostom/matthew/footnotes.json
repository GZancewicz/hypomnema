[Greek: Κα λαθεν τον ρχοντα το ανο τουτο παρθενα Μαρα, κα τοκετς ατ, μοω κα θνατο το Κυρου τρα μυστρια κραυγ τινα ν συχ Θεο πρχθη]. “Now the virginity of Mary, and her delivery, was kept in secret from the prince of this world, as was also the Lord’s death; three most notable mysteries, yet done in Secret of God.” [See Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. I., p. 57. The Greek given in this note is from the “briefer” form of the Ignatian Epistles. But the “longer” form differs very little, and the Syriac version, brief as it is, contains this sentence.—R.] And Origen, 6th Homily on St. Luke, says, “It has been well written in one of the epistles of a certain martyr, I mean Ignatius, the next Bishop of Antioch after the blessed Peter, him who fought with wild beasts in the persecution at Rome, ‘Now the virginity of Mary was kept in secret from the prince of this world.’ It was concealed because of Joseph, because of her espousals, because she was supposed to have a husband. For, had she had no spouse or supposed husband, it could not have been concealed from the prince of this world. For presently the thought would have silently occurred to the evil one, ‘How is she with child, who knoweth not a man? This conception must be divine, it must be something higher than human nature.’ On the contrary, our Saviour had purposed that the devil should be ignorant of his Œconomy and Incarnation: for which cause He both in His birth concealed the same, and commanded His disciples afterwards that they should not make Him known. Also when tempted by the devil in person, He no where owned Himself Son of God.” Origen then quotes 1 Cor. ii. 6–8, to the same effect. And in answer to the objection, How the devils which were from time to time cast out knew Him to be the Son of God, he suggests that it might be owing to their inferiority in malice and mischief: according to the rule among men, that the worse they are, the less they can know of Christ. [The Homilies of Origen are not included in the Ante-Nicene Fathers.]"

Accordingly, after the persecution by the Jews, and the assent of that profane multitude to His murder, Christ passes over to the nations, sold as they were to the vainest superstitions. He leaves Jewry, and is carried into the world which knows Him not: while Bethlehem, i.e., Judæa, overflows with the blood of martyrs. As to Herod’s rage and his murdering the infants, it is the type of the Jewish people raging against the Christians, under the notion that by the slaughter of the blessed martyrs they may blot out Christ’s name from the faith and profession of all men.” p.613, ed.

Marcion, his disciple, within a few years improved on him (Hær. 42, sec. 3), “saying, that there are three principles: one, that on high, unnamed, and unseen, which it pleases him to call the good God (this however, was not the Creator of any of the things that are in the world): another, a visible God, Creator and Artificer: and, in the third place, the devil.…Now the Creator, and Artificer, and visible One, they say, is the God of the Jews, and is also the Judge.” Cf. ibid. sec. 6; St. Aug. de Hæres. 22; Tertull. contr.

The practice of unmarried men, especially of the clergy, having single young women in their houses, is a frequent object of warning and censure both in the Homilies of the Fathers and in Church Canons. The earliest mention of such a thing, and of the sad abuse consequent on it, appears to be in St. Irenæus, i. 6, 3: who lays it to the charge of the Valentinian heretics. Tertullian (de Jejun. ad fin.) imputes it to the Catholics. St. Cyprian’s fourth Epistle (ed. Fell.) was written to repress and punish an instance of it in the Church of Carthage. It was one of the charges against Paul of Samosata, and was forbidden by the third canon of Nicæa. See Dr. Routh’s Reliquiæ Sacræ, 2,506, to which the editor is indebted for this note. The custom seems to have prevailed particularly at Antioch, ib. 482. See also an oration of Chrysostom on this subject, vi. 214."

The word [Greek: ἐπιοσιο] is found only in Matt. vi. 11, Luke xi. 3, and in the Christian literature based on these passages. As all Biblical scholars are aware, the etymology and meaning are still open to discussion. See Thayer’s Greek Lexicon, New Testament, sub voce. The Fathers generally gave it a spiritual or mystical sense, and Chrysostom’s position is, therefore, the more important. The modern views may be inferred from the R.V., which in the text of both renders the word “daily,” with the margin “Greek, our bread for the coming day,” but the American Company add as a second marginal rendering, “our needful bread.” These two marginal renderings represent two distinct etymologies, while “daily” is an explanatory or inferential rendering, for which the authority of Chrysostom has furnished strong support.—R."

He tried to undermine the glory of the martyrs. I mean, because they die violent deaths, he wishing to diffuse an evil impression of them, did this. This, however, he could not do, but another very grievous result he did accomplish. He induced, by these doctrines, the sorcerers that minister to him to butcher the bodies of many tender youths, in the hope that they would become demons, and in return minister to them.” He proceeds to argue against the superstition much as in the text here."

St. Hilarion, c. 32. “Very many, wounded by serpents, having had recourse to Hilarion, indeed all the husbandmen and shepherds, upon touching their wounds with consecrated oil, recovered lasting health.” Other cases occur in church history, and illustrate the importance which the early writers attribute to the sacred oil in the church ritual, and the account of the miracle of St. Narcissus in Euseb. E. H. vi. 9. This statement of St. Chrysostom should be borne in mind, as qualifying what he so often seems to affirm or imply, that miraculous gifts had been withdrawn."

So I conjecture,” Mr. Field adds, “I have nothing to add to this. For those whom Athanæus” (from Theognis) “mentions, as gathering a dole for the swallow (p.360, B.) seem not to answer to what is here meant. They, by way of begging, used to chant a sort of song about the coming of the swallow. It was the custom of the Rhodians particularly.”"
