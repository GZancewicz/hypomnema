17:1 Then said he unto the disciples,
17:2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.
17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
17:4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
17:6 And the Lord said,
17:7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
17:8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
17:9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.
17:11 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
17:12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
17:13 And they lifted up
17:14 And when he saw
17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
17:16 And fell down on
17:17 And Jesus answering said,
17:18 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
17:19 And he said unto him,
17:20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said,
17:21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
17:22 And he said unto the disciples,
17:23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after
17:24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one
17:25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.
17:26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
17:27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
17:28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
