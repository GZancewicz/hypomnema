23:5 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
23:6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men
23:7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

23:26 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix
23:27 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
23:28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
23:29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.

23:32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
