2:1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
2:2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
2:3 For our exhortation
2:4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
2:5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God
2:6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor
2:7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
2:8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
2:9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.

2:11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father
2:12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
2:13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received
2:14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they
2:15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
2:16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
2:17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
2:19 For what
2:20 For ye are our glory and joy.
