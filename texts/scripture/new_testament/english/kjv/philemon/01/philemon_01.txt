1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
1:2 And to
1:3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1:4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
1:5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
1:6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
