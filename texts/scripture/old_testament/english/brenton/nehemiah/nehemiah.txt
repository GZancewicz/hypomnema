1:5 And I said, Nay, I pray thee, O Lord God of heaven, the mighty, the great and terrible, keeping thy covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to those that keep his commandments:
1:6 let now thine ear be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, this day
1:7 We have altogether broken
1:8 Remember, I pray thee, the word wherewith thou didst charge thy servant Moses, saying, If ye break covenant

2:2 And the king said to me, Why is thy countenance sad, and dost thou not control thyself? and now this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much alarmed,
2:3 and I said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be said, forasmuch as the city, even the home of the sepulchres of my fathers, has been laid waste, and her gates have been devoured with fire?
2:4 And the king said to me, For what dost thou ask thus? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
2:5 And I said to the king, If

2:10 And Sanaballat the Aronite heard
2:11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
2:12 And I rose up by night, I and a few men with me; and I told no man what God put into my heart to do with Israel; and there was no beast with me, except the beast which I rode upon.
2:13 And I went forth by the gate of the valley by night, and to the mouth of the well of fig trees, and to the dung-gate: and I mourned over the wall of Jerusalem which they were destroying, and her gates were devoured with fire.
2:14 And I passed on to the fountain gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no room for the beast to pass under me.
2:15 And I went up by the wall of the brook by night, and mourned over the wall, and passed through the gate of the valley, and returned.
2:16 And the sentinels knew not why I went, nor what I was doing; and until that time I told
2:17 Then I said to them, Ye see this evil, in which we are, how Jerusalem is desolate, and her gates have been set on fire: come, and let us build throughout the wall of Jerusalem, and we shall be no longer a reproach.
2:18 And I told them of the hand of God which was good upon me, also about the words of the king which he spoke to me: and I said, Let us arise and build. And their hands were strengthened for the good
2:19 And Sanaballat the Aronite, and Tobia the servant, the Ammonite, and Gesam the Arabian, heard
2:20 And I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he shall prosper us, and we his servants are pure, and we will build: but ye have no part, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

3:32 And between
4:1 Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall, that it was grievous to him, and he was very angry, and railed against the Jews.
4:2 And he said before his brethren (that
4:3 And Tobias the Ammanite came near to him, and said to them, Do they sacrifice or eat in their place? shall not a fox go up and pull down their wall of stones?
4:4 Hear, O our God, for we have become a scorn; and return thou their reproach upon their head, and make them a scorn in a land of captivity,
4:5 and do not cover
4:7 But it came to pass, when Sanaballat and Tobia, and the Arabians, and the Ammanites, heard that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was advancing,
4:8 And all of them assembled together, to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to destroy it utterly.
4:9 So we prayed to our God and set watchmen against them day and night, because of them.
4:10 And Juda said, The strength of the enemies is broken, yet
4:11 And they that afflicted us said, They shall not know, and they shall not see, until we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
4:12 And it came to pass, when the Jews who lived near them came, that they said to us, They are coming up against us from every quarter.
4:13 So I set
4:14 And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the captains, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember our great and terrible God, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
4:15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was made known to us, and God had frustrated their counsel, that we all returned to the wall,
4:16 And it came to pass from that day
4:17 even of them that were building the wall:—and those who carried the burdens
4:18 And the builders
4:19 And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work
4:20 In whatsoever place ye shall hear the sound of the cornet, thither gather yourselves together to us; and our God shall fight for us.
4:21 So we
4:22 And at that time I said to the people, Lodge ye every man with his servant in the midst of Jerusalem, and let the night be a watch-time to you, and the day a work-time.
4:23 And I was
5:1 And the cry of the people and their wives
5:2 And some said, We
5:3 And some said,
5:4 And some said, We have borrowed money for the king's tributes:—our fields, and our vineyards, and houses
5:5 And now our flesh
5:6 And I was much grieved as I heard their cry and these words.
5:7 And my heart took counsel within me, and I contended against the nobles, and the princes, and I said to them, Should every man demand of his brother what ye demand? And I appointed against them a great assembly,
5:8 and I said to them, We of our free-will have redeemed our brethren the Jews that were sold to the Gentiles; and do ye sell your brethren? and shall they be delivered to us? And they were silent, and found no answer.
5:9 And I said, The thing which ye do
5:10 Both my brethren, and my acquaintances, and I, have lent them money and corn: let us now leave off this exaction.
5:11 Restore to them, I pray, as at this day, their fields, and their vineyards, and their olive-yards, and their houses, and bring forth to them corn and wine and oil of the money.
5:12 And they said, We will restore, and we will not exact of them; we will do thus as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and bound them by oath to do according to this word.
5:13 And I shook out my garment, and said, So may God shake out every man who shall not keep to this word, from his house, and from his labours, he shall be even thus shaken out, as an outcast and empty. And all the congregation said, Amen, and they praised the Lord: and the people did this thing.
5:14 From the day that he charged me to be their ruler in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Arthasastha, twelve years, I and my brethren ate not
5:15 But as for the former acts of extortion wherein
5:16 Also in the work of the wall I treated them not with rigor, I bought not land: and all that were gathered together
5:17 And the Jews, to
5:18 And there came
5:19 Remember me, O God, for good,
6:1 Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gesam the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and
6:2 that Sanaballat and Gesam sent to me, saying, Come and let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they
6:3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I shall not be able to come down, lest the work should cease: as soon as I shall have finished it, I will come down to you.
6:4 And they sent to me
6:5 Then Sanaballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.
6:6 And in it was written, It has been reported among the Gentiles that thou and the Jews are planning to revolt: therefore thou art building the wall, and thou wilt be a king to them.
6:7 And moreover thou has appointed prophets to thyself, that thou mightest dwell in Jerusalem as a king over Juda: and now these words will be reported to the king. Now then, come, let us take counsel together.
6:8 And I sent to him, saying, It has not happened according to these words,
6:9 For all were trying to alarm us, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from this work, and it shall not be done. Now therefore I have strengthened my hands.
6:10 And I came into the house of Semei the son of Dalaia the Son of Metabeel, and he was shut up; and he said, Let us assemble together in the house of God, in the midst of it, and let us shut the doors of it; for they are coming by night to slay thee.
6:11 And I said, Who is the man that shall enter into the house, that he may live?
6:12 And I observed, and, behold, God had not sent him, for the prophecy was a fable
6:13 and Tobias and Sanaballat had hired against me a multitude, that I might be frightened, and do this, and sin, and become to them an ill name, that they might reproach me.
6:14 Remember, O God, Tobias and Sanaballat, according to these their deeds, and the prophetess Noadia, and the rest of the prophets who tried to alarm me.
6:15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the
6:16 And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard
6:17 And in those days letters came to Tobias from many nobles of Juda, and those of Tobias came to them.
6:18 For many in Juda were bound to him by oath, because he was son-in-law of Sechenias the son of Herae; and Jonan his son had taken the daughter of Mesulam the son of Barachia to wife.
6:19 And they reported his words to me, and carried out my words to him: and Tobias sent letters to terrify me.
7:1 And it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
7:2 that I gave charge to Ananias my brother, and Ananias the ruler of the palace, over Jerusalem: for he was a true man, and one that feared God beyond many.
7:3 And I said to them, The gates of Jerusalem shall not be opened till sunrise; and while they are still watching, let the doors be shut, and bolted; and set watches of them that dwell in Jerusalem,

8:1 And the seventh month arrived, and the children of Israel
8:2 So Esdras the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and every one who had understanding
8:3 And he read in it from the time of sun-rise to the middle of the day, before the men and the women; and they understood
8:4 And Esdras the scribe stood on a wooden stage, and there stood next to him Mattathias, and Samaeas, and Ananias, and Urias, and Chelcia, and Massia, on his right hand; and on his left Phadaeas, and Misael, and Melchias, and Asom, and Asabadma, and Zacharias, and Mesollam.
8:5 And Esdras opened the book before all the people, for he was above the people; and it came to pass when he had opened it,
8:6 And Esdras blessed the Lord, the great God: and all the people answered, and said, Amen, lifting up their hands: and they bowed down and worshipped the Lord with their face to the ground.
8:7 And Jesus and Banaias and Sarabias instructed the people in the law, and the people
8:8 And they read in the book of the law of God, and Esdras taught, and instructed them distinctly in the knowledge of the Lord, and the people understood
8:9 And Neemias, and Esdras the priest and scribe, and the Levites, and they that instructed the people, spoke and said to all the people, It is a holy day to the Lord our God; do not mourn, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
8:10 And
8:11 And the Levites caused all the people to be silent, saying, Be silent, for
8:12 So all the people departed to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, for they understood the words which he made known to them.
8:13 And on the second day the heads of families assembled with all the people,
8:14 And they found written in the law which the Lord commanded Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths, in the feast in the seventh month:
8:15 and that they should sound with trumpets in all their cities, and in Jerusalem. And Esdras said, Go forth to the mountain, and bring branches of olive, and branches of cypress trees, and branches of myrtle, and branches of palm trees, and branches of
8:16 And the people went forth, and brought
8:17 And all the congregation who had returned from the captivity, made booths, and dwelt in booths: for the children of Israel
8:18 And
9:1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel assembled with fasting, and in sackcloths, and with ashes on their head.
9:2 And the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
9:3 And they stood in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their god: and they confessed
9:4 And
9:5 And the Levites, Jesus and Cadmiel, said, Rise up, bless the Lord our God forever and ever: and let them bless thy glorious name, and exalt it with all blessing and praise.
9:6 And Esdras said, Thou art the only true Lord; thou madest the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all their array, the earth, and all things that are in it, the seas, and all things in them; and thou quickenest all things, and the hosts of heaven worship thee.
9:7 Thou art the Lord God, thou didst choose Abram, and broughtest him out of the land of the Chaldeans, and gavest him the name of Abraam:
9:8 and thou foundest his heart faithful before thee, and didst make a covenant with him to give to him and to his seed the land of the Chananites, and the Chettites, and Amorites, and Pherezites, and Jebusites, and Gergesites; and thou hast confirmed thy words, for thou
9:9 And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and thou heardest their cry at the Red Sea.
9:10 And thou shewedst signs and wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knowest that they behaved insolently against them: and thou madest thyself a name, as at this day.
9:11 And thou didst cleave the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; and thou didst cast into the deep them that were about to pursue them, as a stone in the mighty water.
9:12 And thou guidedst them by day by a pillar of cloud, and by night by a pillar of fire, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.
9:13 Also thou camest down upon mount Sina, and thou spakest to them out of heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and laws of truth, ordinances, and good commandments.
9:14 And thou didst make known to them thy holy sabbath; thou didst enjoin upon them commandments, and ordinances, and a law, by the hand of thy servant Moses.
9:15 And thou gavest them bread from heaven for their food, and thou broughtest them forth water from a rock for their thirst; and thou badest them go in to inherit the land over which thou stretchedst out thy hand to give
9:16 But they and our fathers behaved proudly, and hardened their neck, and did not hearken to thy commandments,
9:17 and refused to listen, and remembered not thy wonders which thou wroughtest with them; and they hardened their neck, and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt: but thou, O God,
9:18 And still farther they even made to themselves a molten calf, and said, These
9:19 Yet thou in thy great compassions didst not forsake them in the wilderness: thou didst not turn away from them the pillar of the cloud by day, to guide them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.
9:20 And thou gavest thy good Spirit to instruct them, and thou didst not withhold thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water in their thirst.
9:21 And thou didst sustain them forty years in the wilderness; thou didst not allow anything to fail them: their garments did not wax old, and their feet were not bruised.
9:22 Moreover, thou gavest them kingdoms, and didst divide nations to them: and they inherited the land of Seon king of Esebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.
9:23 And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land of which thou spokest to their fathers;
9:24 And they inherited it: and thou didst destroy from before them the dwellers in the land of the Chananites, and thou gavest into their hands them and their kings, and the nations of the land, to do unto them as it pleased them.
9:25 And they took lofty cities, and inherited houses full of all good things, wells dug, vineyards, and oliveyards, and every fruit tree in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and grew fat, and rioted in thy great goodness.
9:26 But they turned, and revolted from thee, and cast thy law behind their backs; and they slew thy prophets, who testified against them to turn them back to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
9:27 Then thou gavest them into the hand of them that afflicted them, and they did afflict them: and they cried to thee in the time of their affliction, and thou didst hear them from thy heaven, and in thy great compassions gavest them deliverers, and didst save them from the hand of them that afflicted them.
9:28 But when they rested, they did evil again before thee: so thou leftest them in the hands of their enemies, and they ruled over them: and they cried again to thee, and thou heardest
9:29 And thou didst testify against them, to bring them back to thy law: but they hearkened not, but sinned against thy commandments and thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and they turned their back, and hardened their neck, and heard not.
9:30 Yet thou didst bear long with them many years, and didst testify to them by thy Spirit by the hand of thy prophets: but they hearkened not; so thou gavest them into the hand of the nations of the land.
9:31 But thou in thy many mercies didst not appoint them to destruction, and didst not forsake them; for thou art strong, and merciful, and pitiful.
9:32 And now, O our God, the powerful, the great, the mighty, and the terrible, keeping thy covenant and thy mercy, let not all the trouble seem little in thy sight which has come upon us, and our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and upon all thy people, from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day.
9:33 But thou
9:34 And our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our fathers, have not performed thy law, and have not given heed to thy commandments, and
9:35 And they did not serve thee in thy kingdom, and in thy great goodness which thou gavest to them, and in the large and fat land which thou didst furnish before them, and they turned not from their evil devices.
9:36 Behold, we are servants this day, and
9:37 and its produce
9:38 And in regard to all these circumstances we make a covenant, and write

10:28 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nathinim, and every one who drew off from the nations of the land to the law of God, their wives, their sons, their daughters, every one who had knowledge and understanding,
10:29 were urgent with their brethren, and bound them under a curse, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which was given by the hand of Moses, the servant of God; to keep and to do all the commandments of the Lord, and his judgments, and his ordinances;
10:30 and that we will not,
10:31 And
10:32 And we will impose ordinances upon ourselves, to levy on ourselves the third part of a didrachm yearly for the service of the house of our God;
10:33 the shewbread, and the continual meat-offering, and for the continual whole-burnt-offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moon, for the feast, and for the holy things, and the sin-offerings, to make atonement for Israel, and for the works of the house of our God.
10:34 And we cast lots for the office of wood-bearing,
10:35 and to bring the first-fruits of our land, and the first-fruits of the fruit of every tree, year by year, into the house of the Lord:
10:36 the first-born of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the first-born of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, for the priests that minister in the house of our God.
10:37 And the first-fruits of our corn, and the fruit of every tree, of wine, and of oil, will we bring to the priests to the treasury of the house of God; and a tithe of our land to the Levites: for the Levites themselves shall receive tithes in all the cities of the land we cultivate.
10:38 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites in the tithe of the Levite: and the Levites shall bring up the tenth part of
10:39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring into the treasuries the first-fruits of the corn, and wine, and oil; and there
11:1 And the chiefs of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: and the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of
11:2 And the people blessed all the men that volunteered to dwell in Jerusalem.
11:3 Now these

11:19 And the porters; Acub, Telamin, and their brethren, a hundred and seventy-two.
11:22 And the overseer of the Levites
11:23 For so was the king's commandment concerning them.
11:24 And Phathaia son of Baseza was in attendance on the king in every matter for the people,
11:25 and with regard to villages in their country district: and
11:26 and in Jesu,
11:27 and in Bersabee:
11:30 And their villages
11:31 And the children of Benjamin
11:36 And of the Levites there were divisions to Juda
12:1 Now these
12:2 Amaria, Maluch,
12:3 Sechenia.
12:7 These
12:8 And the Levites
12:9 and his brethren
12:10 And Jesus begot Joakim, and Joakim begot Eliasib, and Eliasib
12:11 and Jodae begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jadu.
12:12 And in the days of Joakim, his brethren the priests and the heads of families
12:13 to Esdra, Mesulam; to Amaria, Joanan;
12:14 to Amaluch, Jonathan; to Sechenia, Joseph;

12:21 to Elkia, Asabias; to Jedeiu, Nathanael.
12:22 The Levites in the days of Eliasib, Joada, and Joa, and Joanan, and Idua,
12:23 And the sons of Levi, heads of families,
12:24 And the heads of the Levites
12:25 When I gathered the porters,
12:26 it was
12:27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep a feast of dedication and gladness with thanksgiving, and they sounded cymbals with songs, and
12:28 And the sons of the singers were assembled both from the neighbourhood round about to Jerusalem, and from the villages,
12:29 and from the country: for the singers built themselves villages by Jerusalem.
12:30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, and the porters, and the wall.
12:31 And they brought up the princes of Juda on the wall, and they appointed two great
12:32 And after them went Osaia, and half the princes of Juda,
12:33 and Azarias, and Esdras, and Mesollam,
12:34 and Juda, and Benjamin, and Samaias and Jeremia.
12:35 And
12:36 and his brethren, Samaia, and Oziel, Gelol, Jama, Aia, Nathanael, and Juda, Anani, to praise with the hymns of David the man of God; and Esdras the scribe
12:37 at the gate, to praise before them, and they went up by the steps of the city of David, in the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate
12:39 of Ephraim, and to the fish-gate, and by the tower of Anameel, and as far as the sheep-gate.
12:42 And the singers were heard, and were numbered.
12:43 And in that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had made them very joyful: and their wives and their children rejoiced: and the joy in Jerusalem was heard from afar off.
12:44 And in that day they appointed men over the treasuries, for the treasures, the first-fruits, and the tithes, and
12:45 And they kept the charges of their God, and the charges of the purification, and
12:46 For in the days of David Asaph was originally first of the singers, and
12:47 And all Israel in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Neemias, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, a daily rate: and consecrated them to the Levites: and the Levites consecrated them to the sons of Aaron.
13:1 In that day they read in the book of Moses in the ears of the people; and it was found written in it, that the Ammonites and Moabites should not enter into the congregation of God for ever;
13:2 because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing.
13:3 And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that they were separated,
13:4 And before this time Eliasib the priest dwelt in the treasury of the house of our God, connected with Tobias;
13:5 and he made himself a great treasury, and there they were formerly in the habit of bestowing the offerings, and the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil, the ordered portion of the Levites, and singers, and porters; and the first-fruits of the priests.
13:6 But in all this
13:7 and I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the mischief which Eliasib had done in the case of Tobias, in making for him a treasury in the court of the house of God.
13:8 And it appeared very evil to me: so I cast forth all the furniture of the house of Tobias from the treasury.
13:9 And I gave orders, and they purified the treasuries: and I restored thither the vessels of the house of God,
13:10 And I understood that the portion of the Levites had not been given: and they had fled every one to his field, the Levites and the singers doing the work.
13:11 And I strove with the commanders, and said, Wherefore has the house of God been abandoned? and I assembled them, and set them in their place.
13:12 And all Juda brought a tithe of the wheat and the wine and the oil into the treasuries,
13:13 to the charge of Selemia the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and Phadaea of the Levites: and next to them
13:14 Remember me, O God, in this, and let not my kindness be forgotten which I have wrought in
13:15 In those days I saw in Juda
13:16 and I testified in the day of their sale. Also their dwelt in it
13:17 And I strove with the free children of Juda, and said to them, What
13:18 Did not your fathers thus, and our God brought upon them and upon us and upon this city all these evils? and do ye bring additional wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath?
13:19 And it came to pass, when the gates were set up in Jerusalem, before the sabbath, that I spoke, and they shut the gates; and I gave orders that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set
13:20 So all
13:21 Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye lodge in front of the wall? if ye do so again, I will stretch out my hand upon you. From that time they came not on the sabbath.
13:22 and I told the Levites who were purifying themselves, and came and kept the gates, that they should sanctify the sabbath-day. Remember me, O God, for these things, and spare me according to the abundance of thy mercy.
13:23 And in those days I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon,
13:24 and their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and did not know how to speak in the Jewish language.
13:25 And I strove with them and cursed them; and I smote some of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God,
13:26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin thus? though there was no king like him among many nations, and he was beloved of God, and God made him king over all Israel; yet strange women turned him aside.
13:27 So we will not hearken to you to do all this evil, to break covenant with our God, —to marry strange wives.
13:28 and Elisub the high priest,
13:29 Remember them, O God, for their
13:30 So I purged them from all foreign connection, and established courses for the priests and the Levites,
13:31 And the offering of the wood-bearers
