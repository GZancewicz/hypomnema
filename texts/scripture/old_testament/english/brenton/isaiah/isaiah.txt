1:1 The
1:2 Hear, O heaven, and hearken, O earth: for the Lord has spoken,
1:3 The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know me, and the people has not regarded me.
1:4 Ah sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless children: ye have forsaken the Lord, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
1:5 Why should ye be smitten
1:6 From the feet to the head, there is no soundness in them; neither wound, nor bruise, nor festering ulcer
1:7 Your land is desolate, your cities burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is made desolate, overthrown by strange nations.
1:8 The daughter of Sion shall be deserted as a tent in a vineyard, and as a storehouse of fruits in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
1:9 And if the Lord of Sabaoth had not left us a seed, we should have been as Sodoma, and we should have been made like to Gomorrha.
1:10 Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodoma; attend to the law of God, thou people of Gomorrha.
1:11 Of what
1:12 neither shall ye come
1:13 Though ye bring fine flour,
1:14 your
1:15 When ye stretch forth your hands, I will turn away mine eyes from you: and though ye make many supplications, I will not hearken to you; for your hands are full of blood.
1:16 Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from your souls before mine eyes; cease from your iniquities;
1:17 learn to do well; diligently seek judgment, deliver him that is suffering wrong, plead for the orphan, and obtain justice for the widow.
1:18 And come, let us reason together, saith the Lord: and though your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make
1:19 And if ye be willing, and hearken to me, ye shall eat the good of the land:
1:20 but if ye be not willing, nor hearken to me, a sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
1:21 How has the faithful city Sion,
1:22 Your silver is worthless, thy wine merchants mix the wine with water.
1:23 Thy princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving bribes, seeking after rewards; not pleading for orphans, and not heeding the cause of widows.
1:24 Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Woe to the mighty
1:25 And I will bring my hand upon thee, and purge thee completely, and I will destroy the rebellious, and will take away from thee all transgressors.
1:26 And I will establish thy judges as before, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: and afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother-city Sion.
1:27 For her captives shall be saved with judgment, and with mercy.
1:28 And the transgressors and the sinners shall be crushed together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be utterly consumed.
1:29 For they shall be ashamed of their idols, which they delighted in, and they are made ashamed of the gardens which they coveted.
1:30 For they shall be as a turpentine tree that has cast its leaves, and as a garden that has no water.
1:31 And their strength shall be as a thread of tow, and their works as sparks, and the transgressors and the sinners shall be burnt up together, and there shall be none to quench
2:1 The word which came to Esaias the son of Amos concerning Judea, and concerning Jerusalem.
2:2 For in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be glorious, and the house of God
2:3 And many nations shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will tell us his way, and we will walk in it: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.
2:4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into sickles: and nation shall not take up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.
2:5 And now, O house of Jacob, come,
2:6 For he has forsaken his people the house of Israel, because their land is filled as at the beginning with divinations, as the
2:7 For their land is filled with silver and gold, and there was no number of their treasures; their land also is filled with horses, and there was no number of their chariots.
2:8 And the land is filled with abominations,
2:9 And the mean man bowed down, and the great man was humbled: and I will not pardon them.
2:10 Now therefore enter ye into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the earth, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.
2:11 For the eyes of the Lord are high, but man is low; and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
2:12 For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and haughty, and upon every one that is high and towering, and they shall be brought down;
2:13 and upon every cedar of Libanus, of them that are high and towering, and upon every oak of Basan,
2:14 and upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill,
2:15 and upon every high tower, and upon every high wall,
2:16 and upon every ship of the sea, and upon every display of fine ships.
2:17 And every man shall be brought low, and the pride of men shall fall: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
2:18 And they shall hide all
2:19 having carried
2:20 For in that day a man shall cast forth his silver and gold abominations, which they made
2:21 to enter into the caverns of the solid rock, and into the clefts of the rocks, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.
3:1 Behold now, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and from Judea the mighty man and mighty woman, the strength of bread, and the strength of water,
3:2 the great and mighty man, the warrior and the judge, and the prophet, and the counsellor, and the elder,
3:3 the captain of fifty also, and the honourable counsellor, and the wise artificer, and the intelligent hearer.
3:4 And I will make youths their princes, and mockers shall have dominion over them.
3:5 And the people shall fall, man upon man, and
3:6 For a man shall lay hold of his brother, as one of his father's household, saying, Thou hast raiment, be thou our ruler, and let my meat be under thee.
3:7 And he shall answer in that day, and say, I will not be thy ruler; for I have no bread in my house, nor raiment: I will not be the ruler of this people.
3:8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judea has fallen, and their tongues
3:9 Wherefore now their glory has been brought low, and the shame of their countenance has withstood them, and they have proclaimed their sin as Sodom, and made it manifest.
3:10 Woe to their soul, for they have devised an evil counsel against themselves, saying against themselves, Let us bind the just, for he is burdensome to us: therefore shall they eat the fruits of their works.
3:11 Woe to the transgressor! evils shall happen to him according to the works of his hands.
3:12 O my people, your exactors strip you, and extortioners rule over you: O my people, they that pronounce you blessed lead you astray, and pervert the path of your feet.
3:13 But now the Lord will stand up for judgment, and will enter into judgment with his people.
3:14 The Lord himself shall enter into judgment with the elders of the people, and with their rulers: but why have ye set my vineyard on fire, and
3:15 Why do ye wrong my people, and shame the face of the poor?
3:16 Thus saith the Lord, Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with an outstretched neck, and with winking of the eyes, and motion of the feet, at the same time drawing their garments in trains, and at the same time sporting with their feet:
3:17 therefore the Lord will humble the chief daughters of Sion, and the Lord will expose their form in that day;
3:18 and the Lord will take away the glory of their raiment, the curls and the fringes, and the crescents,
3:19 and the chains, and the ornaments of their faces,
3:20 and the array of glorious ornaments, and the armlets, and the bracelets, and the wreathed work, and the finger-rings, and the ornaments for the right hand, and the ear-rings,
3:21 and the garments with scarlet borders, and the garments with purple grounds,
3:22 and the shawls to be worn in the house, and the Spartan transparent dresses,
3:23 and those made of fine linen, and the purple
3:24 And there shall be instead of a sweet smell, dust; and instead of a girdle, thou shalt gird thyself with a rope; and instead of a golden ornament for the head, thou shalt have baldness on account of thy works; and instead of a tunic with a scarlet ground, thou shalt gird thyself with sackcloth.
3:25 And thy most beautiful son whom thou lovest shall fall by the sword; and your mighty men shall fall by the sword, and shall be brought low.
3:26 And the stores of your ornaments shall mourn, and thou shalt be left alone, and shalt be levelled with the ground.
4:1 And seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own raiment: only let thy name be called upon us,
4:2 And in that day God shall shine gloriously in counsel on the earth, to exalt and glorify the remnant of Israel.
4:3 And it shall be,
4:4 For the Lord shall wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Sion, and shall purge out the blood from the midst of them, with the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning.
4:5 And he shall come, and it shall be with regard to every place of mount Sion, yea, all the region round about it shall a cloud overshadow by day, and
4:6 And it shall be for a shadow from the heat, and as a shelter and a hiding-place from inclemency
5:1 Now I will sing to
5:2 And I made a hedge round it, and dug a trench, and planted a choice vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and dug a place for the wine-vat in it: and I waited
5:3 And now, ye dwellers in Jerusalem, and
5:4 What shall I do any more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Whereas I expected
5:5 And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will pull down its walls, and it shall be
5:6 And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it.
5:7 For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Juda
5:8 Woe
5:9 For these things have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them.
5:10 For where ten yoke of oxen plough
5:11 Woe
5:12 For they drink wine with harp, and psaltery, and drums, and pipes: but they regard not the works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands.
5:13 Therefore my people have been taken captive, because they know not the Lord: and there has been a multitude of dead
5:14 Therefore hell has enlarged its desire and opened its mouth without ceasing: and her glorious and great, and her rich and her pestilent men shall go down
5:15 And the mean man shall be brought low, and the great man shall be disgraced, and the lofty eyes shall be brought low.
5:16 But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be glorified in righteousness.
5:17 And they that were spoiled shall be fed as bulls, and lambs shall feed on the waste places of them that are taken away.
5:18 Woe
5:19 who say, Let him speedily hasten what he will do, that we may see
5:20 Woe
5:21 Woe
5:22 Woe to the strong
5:23 who justify the ungodly for rewards, and take away the righteousness of the righteous.
5:24 Therefore as stubble shall be burnt by a coal of fire, and shall be consumed by a violent flame, their root shall be as chaff, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and insulted the word of the Holy One of Israel.
5:25 Therefore the Lord of hosts was greatly angered against his people, and he reached forth his hand upon them, and smote them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcases were as dung in the midst of the way: yet for all this his anger has not been turned away, but his hand is yet raised.
5:26 Therefore shall he lift up a signal to the nations that are afar, and shall hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they are coming very quickly.
5:27 They shall not hunger nor be weary, neither shall they slumber nor sleep; neither shall they loose their girdles from their loins, neither shall their shoe-latchets be broken.
5:28 Whose arrows are sharp, and their bows bent; their horses' hoofs are counted as solid rock: their chariot-wheels are as a storm.
5:29 They rage as lions, and draw nigh as a lion's whelps: and he shall seize, and roar as a wild beast, and he shall cast
5:30 And he shall roar on account of them in that day, as the sound of the swelling sea; and they shall look to the land, and, behold,
6:1 And it came to pass in the year in which king Ozias died,
6:2 And seraphs stood round about him: each one had six wings: and with two they covered
6:3 And one cried to the other, and they said, Holy, holy, holy,
6:4 And the lintel shook at the voice they uttered, and the house was filled with smoke.
6:5 And I said, Woe is me, for I am pricked to the heart; for being a man, and having unclean lips, I dwell in the midst of a people having unclean lips; and I have seen with mine eyes the King, the Lord of hosts.
6:6 And there was sent to me one of the seraphs, and he had in his hand a coal, which he had taken off the altar with the tongs:
6:7 and he touched my mouth, and said, Behold, this has touched thy lips, and will take away thine iniquities, and will purge off thy sins.
6:8 And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go to this people? And I said, Behold, I am
6:9 Ye shall hear indeed, but ye shall not understand; and ye shall see indeed, but ye shall not perceive.
6:10 For the heart of this people has become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
6:11 And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until the cities be deserted by reason of their not being inhabited, and the houses by reason of there being no men, and the land shall be left desolate.
6:12 And after this God shall remove the men far off, and they that are left upon the land shall be multiplied.
6:13 And yet there shall be a tenth upon it, and again it shall be for a spoil, as a turpentine tree, and as an acorn when it falls out of its husk.
7:1 And it came to pass in the days of Achaz
7:2 And a message was brought to the house of David, saying, Aram has conspired with Ephraim. And his soul was amazed, and the soul of his people, as in a wood a tree is moved by the wind.
7:3 And the Lord said to Esaias, Go forth to meet Achaz, thou, and thy son Jasub who is left, to the pool of the upper way of the fuller's field.
7:4 And thou shalt say to him, Take care to be quiet, and fear not, neither let thy soul be disheartened because of these two smoking firebrands: for when my fierce anger is over, I will heal again.
7:5 And
7:6 We will go up against Judea, and having conferred with them we will turn them away to our side, and we will make the son of Tabeel king of it;
7:7 thus saith the Lord of hosts, This counsel shall not abide, nor come to pass.
7:8 But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasim; and yet within sixty and five years the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from
7:9 And the head of Ephraim is Somoron, and the head of Somoron the son of Romelias: but if ye believe not, neither will ye at all understand.
7:10 And the Lord again spoke to Achaz, saying,
7:11 Ask for thyself a sign of the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height.
7:12 And Achaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
7:13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a little thing for you to contend with men? and how do ye contend against the Lord?
7:14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel.
7:15 Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows either to prefer evil,
7:16 For before the child shall know good or evil, he refuses evil, to choose the good; and the land shall be forsaken which thou art afraid of because of the two kings.
7:17 But God shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days which have never come, from the day that Ephraim took away from Juda the king of the Assyrians.
7:18 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall hiss for the flies, which
7:19 And they all shall enter into the clefts of the land, and into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves, and into every ravine.
7:20 In that day the Lord shall shave with the hired razor of the king of Assyria beyond the river the head, and the hairs of the feet, and will remove the beard.
7:21 And it shall come to pass in that day,
7:22 And it shall come to pass from their drinking an abundance of milk,
7:23 And it shall come to pass in that day,
7:24 Men
7:25 And every mountain shall be certainly ploughed: there shall no fear come thither: for there shall be from
8:1 And the Lord said to me, Take to thyself a volume of a great new
8:2 And make me witnesses
8:3 And I went in to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me, Call his name, Spoil quickly, plunder speedily.
8:4 For before the child shall know
8:5 And the Lord spoke to me yet again,
8:6 Because this people chooses not the water of Siloam that goes softly, but wills to have Rassin, and the son of Romelias
8:7 therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon you the water of the river, strong and abundant,
8:8 and he shall take away from Juda
8:9 Know, ye Gentiles, and be conquered; hearken ye, even to the extremity of the earth: be conquered, after ye have strengthened yourselves; for even if ye should again strengthen yourselves, ye shall again be conquered.
8:10 And whatsoever counsel ye shall take, the Lord shall bring it to nought; and whatsoever word ye shall speak, it shall not stand among you: for God is with us.
8:11 Thus saith the Lord, With a strong hand they revolt from the course of the way of this people, saying,
8:12 Let them not say,
8:13 Sanctify ye the Lord himself; and he shall be thy fear.
8:14 And if thou shalt trust in him, he shall be to thee for a sanctuary; and ye shall not come against
8:15 Therefore many among them shall be weak, and fall, and be crushed; and they shall draw nigh, and men shall be taken securely.
8:16 Then shall those who seal themselves that they may not learn the law be made manifest.
8:17 And
8:18 Behold I and the children which God has given me: and they shall be
8:19 And if they should say to you, Seek those who have in them a divining spirit, and them that speak out of the earth, them that speak vain words, who speak out of their belly: shall not a nation diligently seek to their God? why do they seek to the dead concerning the living?
8:20 For he has given the law for a help, that they should not speak according to this word, concerning which there are no gifts to give for it.
8:21 And famine shall come sorely upon you, and it shall come to pass,
8:22 and they shall look on the earth below, and behold severe distress, and darkness, affliction, and anguish, and darkness so that
8:23 Drink this first. Act quickly, O land of Zabulon, land of Nephthalim, and the rest
9:1 O people walking in darkness, behold a great light: ye that dwell in the region
9:2 The multitude of the people which thou hast brought down in thy joy, they shall even rejoice before thee as they that rejoice in harvest, and as they that divide the spoil.
9:3 Because the yoke that was laid upon them has been taken away, and the rod that was on their neck: for he has broken the rod of the exactors, as in the day of Madiam.
9:4 For they shall compensate for every garment that has been acquired by deceit, and
9:5 For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and his name is called the Messenger of great counsel: for I will bring peace upon the princes, and health to him.
9:6 His government shall be great, and of his peace there is no end:
9:7 The Lord has sent death upon Jacob, and it has come upon Israel.
9:8 And all the people of Ephraim, and they that dwelt in Samaria shall know, who say in their pride and lofty heart,
9:9 The bricks are fallen down, but come, let us hew stones, and cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a tower.
9:10 And God shall dash down them that rise up against him on mount Sion, and shall scatter his enemies;
9:11 even
9:12 But the people turned not until they were smitten, and they sought not the Lord.
9:13 So the Lord took away from Israel the head and tail, great and small, in one day:
9:14 the old man, and them that respect persons, this is the head; and the prophet teaching unlawful things, he is the tail.
9:15 And they that pronounce this people blessed shall mislead them; and they mislead them that they may devour them.
9:16 Therefore the Lord shall not take pleasure in their young men, neither shall he have pity on their orphans or on their widows: for they are all transgressors and wicked, and every mouth speaks unjustly. For all this
9:17 And iniquity shall burn as fire, and shall be devoured by fire as dry grass: and it shall burn in the thickets of the wood, and shall devour all that is round about the hills.
9:18 The whole earth is set on fire because of the fierce anger of the Lord, and the people shall be as men burnt by fire: no man shall pity his brother.
9:19 But
9:20 For Manasses shall eat
10:1 Woe to them that write wickedness; for when they write they do write wickedness,
10:2 perverting the cause of the poor, violently wresting the judgment of the needy ones of my people, that the widow may be a prey to them, and the orphan a spoil.
10:3 And what will they do in the day of visitation? for affliction shall come to you from afar: and to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory,
10:4 that ye may not fall into captivity?
10:5 Woe to the Assyrians; the rod of my wrath, and anger are in their hands.
10:6 I will send my wrath against a sinful nation, and I will charge my people to take plunder and spoil, and to trample the cities, and to make them dust.
10:7 But he meant not thus, neither did he devise thus in his soul: but his mind shall change, and
10:8 And if they should say to him, Thou alone art ruler;
10:9 then shall he say, Have I not taken the country above Babylon and Chalanes, where the tower was built? and have I
10:10 As I have taken them, I will also take all the kingdoms: howl, ye idols in Jerusalem, and in Samaria.
10:11 For as I did to Samaria and her idols, so will I do also to Jerusalem and her idols.
10:12 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have finished doing all things on mount Sion and Jerusalem,
10:13 For he said, I will act in strength, and in the wisdom of
10:14 And I will shake the inhabited cities: and I will take with my hand all the world as a nest: and I will even take them as eggs that have been left; and there is none that shall escape me, or contradict me.
10:15 Shall the axe glorify itself without him that hews with it? or shall the saw lift up itself without him that uses it, as if one should lift a rod or staff? but it shall not be so;
10:16 but the Lord of hosts shall send dishonour upon thine honour, and burning fire shall be kindled upon thy glory.
10:17 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and he shall sanctify him with burning fire, and it shall devour the wood as grass.
10:18 In that day the mountains shall be consumed, and the hills, and the forests, and
10:19 And they that are left of them shall be a
10:20 And it shall come to pass in that day
10:21 And the remnant of Jacob shall
10:22 And though the people of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be saved.
10:23 He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because the Lord will make a short work in all the world.
10:24 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Be not afraid, my people who dwell in Sion, of the Assyrians, because he shall smite thee with a rod: for I am bringing a stroke upon thee, that
10:25 For yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease: but my wrath shall be against their council.
10:26 And God will stir up
10:27 And it shall come to pass in that day,
10:28 For he shall arrive at the city of Angai, and shall pass on to Maggedo, and shall lay up his stores in Machmas.
10:29 And he shall pass by the valley, and shall arrive at Angai: fear shall seize upon Rama, the city of Saul.
10:30 The daughter of Gallim shall flee; Laisa shall hear; one shall hear in Anathoth.
10:31 Madebena also is amazed, and the inhabitants of Gibbir.
10:32 Exhort ye
10:33 Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will mightily confound the glorious ones; and the haughty in pride shall be crushed, and the lofty shall be brought low:
10:34 and the lofty ones shall fall by the sword, and Libanus shall fall with his lofty ones.
11:1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a blossom shall come up from
11:2 and the Spirit of God shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness shall fill him;
11:3 the spirit of the fear of God. He shall not judge according to appearance, nor reprove according to report:
11:4 but he shall judge the cause of the lowly, and shall reprove the lowly of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he destroy the ungodly one.
11:5 And he shall have his loins girt with righteousness, and his sides clothed with truth.
11:6 And the wolf shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the young calf and bull and lion shall feed together; and a little child shall lead them.
11:7 And the ox and bear shall feed together; and their young shall be together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
11:8 And an infant shall put his hand on the holes of asps, and on the nest of young asps.
11:9 And they shall not hurt, nor shall they at all be able to destroy any one on my holy mountain: for the whole
11:10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall arise to rule over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust, and his rest shall be glorious.
11:11 And it shall be in that day,
11:12 And he shall lift up a standard for the nations, and he shall gather the lost ones of Israel, and he shall gather the dispersed of Juda from the four corners of the earth.
11:13 And the envy of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the enemies of Juda shall perish: Ephraim shall not envy Juda, and Juda shall not afflict Ephraim.
11:14 And they shall fly in the ships of the Philistines: they shall at the same time spoil the sea, and them
11:15 And the Lord shall make desolate the sea of Egypt; and he shall lay his hand on the river with a strong wind, and he shall smite the seven channels, so that men shall pass through it dry-shod.
11:16 And there shall be a passage for my people that is left in Egypt: and it shall be to Israel as the day when he came forth out of the land of Egypt.
12:1 And in that day thou shalt say, I
12:2 Behold, my God is my Saviour; I will trust in him, and not be afraid: for the Lord is my glory and my praise, and is become my salvation.
12:3 Draw ye therefore water with joy out of the wells of salvation.
12:4 And in that day thou shalt say, Sing to the Lord, call aloud upon his name, proclaim his glorious
12:5 Sing praise to the name of the Lord; for he has done great
12:6 Exalt and rejoice, ye that dwell in Sion: for the Holy One of Israel is exalted in the midst of her.
13:1 The Vision which Esaias son of Amos saw against Babylon.
13:2 Lift up a standard on the mountain of the plain, exalt the voice to them, beckon with the hand, open
13:3 I give command, and I bring them: giants are coming to fulfil my wrath, rejoicing at the same time and insulting.
13:4 A voice of many nations on the mountains,
13:5 to come from a land afar off, from the utmost foundation of heaven; the Lord and his warriors
13:6 Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near, and destruction from God shall arrive.
13:7 Therefore every hand shall become powerless, and every soul of man shall be dismayed.
13:8 The elders shall be troubled, and pangs shall seize them, as of a woman in travail: and they shall mourn one to another, and shall be amazed, and shall change their countenance as a flame.
13:9 For behold! the day of the Lord is coming which cannot be escaped,
13:10 For the stars of heaven, and Orion, and all the host of heaven, shall not give their light; and it shall be dark at sunrise, and the moon shall not give her light.
13:11 And I will command evils for the whole world, and
13:12 And they that are left shall be more precious than gold tried in the fire; and a man shall be more precious than the stone that is in Suphir.
13:13 For the heaven shall be enraged, and the earth shall be shaken from her foundation, because of the fierce anger of the Lord of hosts, in the day in which his wrath shall come on.
13:14 And they that are left shall be as a fleeing fawn, and as a stray sheep, and there shall be none to gather
13:15 For whosoever shall be taken shall be overcome; and they that are gathered together shall fall by the sword.
13:16 And they shall dash their children before their eyes; and they shall spoil their houses, and shall take their wives.
13:17 Behold, I will stir up against you the Medes, who do not regard silver, neither have they need of gold.
13:18 They shall break the bows of the young men; and they shall have no mercy on your children; nor shall their eyes spare thy children.
13:19 And Babylon, which is called glorious by the king of the Chaldeans, shall be as
13:20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall any enter into it for many generations: neither shall the Arabians pass through it; nor shall shepherds at all rest in it.
13:21 But wild beasts shall rest there; and the houses shall be filled with howling; and monsters shall rest there, and devils shall dance there,
13:22 and satyrs shall dwell there; and hedgehogs shall make their nests in their houses. It will come soon, and will not tarry.
14:1 And the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and they shall rest on their land: and the stranger shall be added to them, yea, shall be added to the house of Jacob.
14:2 And the Gentiles shall take them, and bring them into their place: and they shall inherit them, and they shall be multiplied upon the land for servants and handmaidens: and they that took them captives shall become captives
14:3 And it shall come to pass in that day,
14:4 And thou shalt take up this lamentation against the king of Babylon,
14:5 The Lord has broken the yoke of sinners, the yoke of princes.
14:6 Having smitten a nation in wrath, with an incurable plague, smiting a nation with a wrathful plague, which spared
14:7 All the earth cries aloud with joy:
14:8 the trees also of Libanus rejoice against thee, and the cedar of Libanus,
14:9 Hell from beneath is provoked to meet thee: all the great ones that have ruled over the earth have risen up together against thee, they that have raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
14:10 All shall answer and say to thee, Thou also hast been taken, even as we; and thou art numbered amongst us.
14:11 Thy glory has come down to Hades, and thy great mirth: under thee they shall spread corruption, and the worm shall be thy covering.
14:12 How has Lucifer, that rose in the morning, fallen from heaven! He that sent
14:13 But thou saidst in thine heart, I will go up to heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of heaven: I will sit on a lofty mount, on the lofty mountains toward the north:
14:14 I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.
14:15 But now thou shalt go down to hell, even to the foundations of the earth.
14:16 They that see thee shall wonder at thee, and say, This is the man that troubled the earth, that made kings to shake;
14:17 that made the whole world desolate, and destroyed its cities; he loosed not those who were in captivity.
14:18 All the kings of the nations lie in honour,
14:19 But thou shalt be cast forth on the mountains, as a loathed carcase, with many dead who have been pierced with swords, going down to the grave.
14:20 As a garment defiled with blood shall not be pure, so neither shalt thou be pure; because thou hast destroyed my land, and hast slain my people: thou shalt not endure for ever,—
14:21 Prepare thy children to be slain for the sins of their father; that they arise not, and inherit the earth, nor fill the earth with wars.
14:22 And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will destroy their name, and remnant, and seed: thus saith the Lord.
14:23 And I will make the region of Babylon desert, so that hedgehogs shall dwell
14:24 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, As I have said, so it shall be: and as I have purposed, so
14:25 even
14:26 This is the purpose which the Lord has purposed upon the whole earth: and this the hand that is uplifted against all the nations.
14:27 For what the Holy God has purposed, who shall frustrate? and who shall turn back his uplifted hand?
14:28 In the year in which king Achaz died this word came.
14:29 Rejoice not, all ye Philistines, because the yoke of him that smote you is broken: for out of the seed of the serpent shall come forth the young of asps, and their young shall come forth flying serpents.
14:30 And the poor shall be fed by him, and poor men shall rest in peace: but he shall destroy thy seed with hunger, and shall destroy thy remnant.
14:31 Howl, ye gates of cities; let the cities be troubled and cry,
14:32 And what shall the kings of the nations answer? That the Lord has founded Sion, and by him the poor of the people shall be saved.
15:1 The Word against the Land of Moab.
15:2 Grieve for yourselves; for even Debon, where your altar is, shall be destroyed: thither shall ye go up to weep, over Nabau of the land of Moab: howl ye: baldness shall be on every head,
15:3 Gird yourselves with sackcloth in her streets: and lament upon her roofs, and in her streets, and in her ways; howl all of you with weeping.
15:4 For Esebon and Eleale have cried: their voice was heard to Jassa: therefore the loins of the region of Moab cry aloud; her soul shall know.
15:5 The heart of the region of Moab cries within her to Segor; for it is
15:6 The water of Nemerim shall be desolate, and the grass thereof shall fail: for there shall be no green grass.
15:7 Shall
15:8 For the cry has reached the border of the region of Moab,
15:9 And the water of Dimon shall be filled with blood: for I will bring Arabians upon Dimon, and I will take away the seed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adama.
16:1 I will send as it were reptiles on the land: is
16:2 For thou shalt be as a young bird taken away from a bird that has flown:
16:3 take farther counsel, and continually make thou a shelter from grief: they flee in darkness at mid-day; they are amazed; be not thou led captive.
16:4 The fugitives of Moab shall sojourn with thee; they shall be to you a shelter from the face of the pursuer: for thine alliance has been taken away, and the oppressing ruler has perished from off the earth.
16:5 And a throne shall be established with mercy; and one shall sit upon it with truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and earnestly seeking judgments, and hasting righteousness.
16:6 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud. I have cut off his pride: thy prophecy shall not be thus,
16:7 Moab shall howl; for all shall howl in the land of Moab: but thou shalt care for them that dwell in Seth, and thou shalt not be ashamed.
16:8 The plains of Esebon shall mourn, the vine of Sebama: swallowing up the nations, trample ye her vines, even to Jazer: ye shall not come together; wander ye in the desert: they that were sent are deserted, for they have gone over to the sea.
16:9 Therefore will I weep as with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sebama; Esebon and Eleale have cast down thy trees; for I will trample on thy harvest and on thy vintages, and all
16:10 And gladness and rejoicing shall be taken away from the vineyards; and they shall not rejoice at all in thy vineyards; and they shall not at all tread wine into the vats; for
16:11 Therefore my belly shall sound as a harp for Moab, and thou hast repaired my inward parts as a wall.
16:12 And it shall be to thy shame, (for Moab is wearied at the altars,) that he shall go in to the idols thereof to pray, but they shall not be at all able to deliver him.
16:13 This is the word which the Lord spoke against Moab, when he spoke.
16:14 And now I say, In three years, of the years of an hireling, the glory of Moab shall be dishonoured
17:1 The Word against Damascus.
17:2 abandoned for ever, to
17:3 And she shall no longer be a strong place for Ephraim to flee to, and there shall no longer be a kingdom in Damascus, or a remnant of Syrians; for thou art no better than the children of Israel,
17:4 There shall be in that day a failure of the glory of Jacob, and the riches of his glory shall be shaken.
17:5 And it shall be as if one should gather standing corn, and reap the grain of the ears; and it shall be as if one should gather ears in a rich valley;
17:6 and
17:7 In that day a man shall trust in him that made him, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
17:8 And they shall not at all trust in their altars, nor in the works of their hands, which their fingers made; and they shall not look to the trees, nor to their abominations.
17:9 In that day thy cities shall be deserted, as the Amorites and the Evæans deserted
17:10 Because thou hast forsaken God thy Saviour, and hast not been mindful of the Lord thy helper; therefore shalt thou plant a false plant, and a false seed.
17:11 In the day wherein thou shalt plant thou shalt be deceived; but if thou sow in the morning,
17:12 Woe
17:13 many nations like much water, as when much water rushes violently: and they shall drive him away, and pursue him afar, as the dust of chaff when men winnow before the wind, and as a storm whirling the dust of the wheel.
17:14 Toward evening, and there shall be grief; before the morning, and he shall not be. This is the portion of them that spoiled you, and the inheritance to them that robbed you of your inheritance.
18:1 Woe to you, ye wings of the land of ships, beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.
18:2 He sends messengers by the sea, and paper letters on the water: for swift messengers shall go to a lofty nation, and to a strange and harsh people. Who is beyond it? a nation not looked for, and trodden down.
18:3 Now all the rivers of the land shall be inhabited as an inhabited country; their land shall be as when a signal is raised from a mountain; it shall be audible as the sound of a trumpet.
18:4 For thus said the Lord to me, There shall be security in my city, as the light of noonday heat, and it shall be as a cloud of dew in the day of harvest.
18:5 Before the reaping time, when the flower has been completely formed, and the unripe grape has put forth its flower and blossomed, then shall he take away the little clusters with pruning-hooks, and shall take away the small branches, and cut them off;
18:6 and he shall leave
18:7 In that time shall presents be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people afflicted and peeled, and from a people great from henceforth and for ever; a nation hoping and
19:1 The Vision of Egypt.
19:2 And the Egyptians shall be stirred up against the Egyptians: and a man shall fight against his brother, and a man against his neighbour, city against city, and law against law.
19:3 And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be troubled within them; and I will frustrate their counsel: and they shall enquire of their gods and their images, and them that speak out of the earth, and them that have in them a divining spirit.
19:4 And I will deliver Egypt into the hands of men, of cruel lords; and cruel kings shall rule over them: thus saith the Lord of hosts.
19:5 And the Egyptians shall drink the water that is by the sea, but the river shall fail, and be dried up.
19:6 And the streams shall fail, and the canals of the river; and every reservoir of water shall be dried up, in every marsh also of reed and papyrus.
19:7 And all the green herbage round about the river, and everything sown by the side of the river, shall be blasted with the wind and dried up.
19:8 And the fishermen shall groan, and all that cast a hook into the river shall groan; they also that cast nets, and the anglers shall mourn.
19:9 And shame shall come upon them that work fine flax, and them that make fine linen.
19:10 And they that work at them shall be in pain, and all that make beer shall be grieved, and be pained in their souls.
19:11 And the princes of Tanis shall be fools:
19:12 Where are now thy wise men? and let them declare to thee, and say, What has the Lord of hosts purposed upon Egypt?
19:13 The princes of Tanis have failed, and the princes of Memphis are lifted up
19:14 For the Lord has prepared for them a spirit of error, and they have caused Egypt to err in all their works, as one staggers who is drunken and vomits also.
19:15 And there shall be no work to the Egyptians, which shall make head or tail, or beginning or end.
19:16 But in that day the Egyptians shall be as women, in fear and in trembling because of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shall bring upon them.
19:17 And the land of the Jews shall be for a terror to the Egyptians: whosoever shall name it to them, they shall fear, because of the counsel which the Lord of hosts has purposed concerning it.
19:18 In that day there shall be five cities in Egypt speaking the language of Chanaan, and swearing by the name of the Lord of hosts; one city shall be called the city of Asedec.
19:19 In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of the Egyptians, and a pillar to the Lord by its border.
19:20 And it shall be for a sign to the Lord for ever in the land of Egypt: for they shall presently cry to the Lord by reason of them that afflict them, and he shall send them a man who shall save them; he shall judge and save them.
19:21 And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day; and they shall offer sacrifices, and shall vow vows to the Lord, and pay
19:22 And the Lord shall smite the Egyptians with a stroke, and shall completely heal them: and they shall return to the Lord, and he shall hear them, and thoroughly heal them.
19:23 In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians, and the Assyrians shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall go to the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians.
19:24 In that day shall Israel be third with the Egyptians and the Assyrians, blessed in the land which the Lord of hosts has blessed,
19:25 saying, Blessed be my people that is in Egypt, and that is among the Assyrians, and Israel mine inheritance.
20:1 In the year when Tanathan came to Azotus, when he was sent by Arna king of the Assyrians, and warred against Azotus, and took it;
20:2 then the Lord spoke to Esaias the son of Amos, saying, Go and take the sackcloth off thy loins, and loose thy sandals from off thy feet, and do thus, going naked and barefoot.
20:3 And the Lord said, As my servant Esaias has walked naked and barefoot three years, there shall be three years for signs and wonders to the Egyptians and Ethiopians;
20:4 for thus shall the king of the Assyrians lead the captivity of Egypt and the Ethiopians, young men and old, naked and barefoot, having the shame of Egypt exposed.
20:5 And the Egyptians being defeated shall be ashamed of the Ethiopians, in whom they had trusted; for they were their glory.
20:6 And they that dwell in this island shall say in that day, Behold, we trusted to flee to them for help, who could not save themselves from the king of the Assyrians: and how shall we be saved?
21:1 The Vision of the Desert.
21:2 so
21:3 Therefore are my loins filled with feebleness, and pangs have seized me as a travailing woman: I dealt wrongfully that I might not hear; I hasted that I might not see.
21:4 My heart wanders, and transgression overwhelms me; my soul is occupied with fear.
21:5 Prepare the table, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and prepare
21:6 For thus said the Lord to me, Go and station a watchman for thyself, and declare whatever thou shalt see.
21:7 And I saw two mounted horsemen, and a rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel.
21:8 Hearken with great attention, and call thou Urias to the watch-tower: the Lord has spoken. I stood continually during the day, and I stood in the camp all the night:
21:9 and, behold, he comes riding in a chariot and pair: and he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all her images and her idols have been crushed to the ground.
21:10 Hear, ye that are left, and ye that are in pain, hear what things I have heard of the Lord of hosts
21:11 The Vision of Idumea.
21:12 I watch in the morning and the night: if thou wouldest enquire, enquire, and dwell by me.
21:13 Thou mayest lodge in the forest in the evening, or in the way of Dædan.
21:14 Ye that dwell in the country of Thæman, bring water to meet him that is thirsty;
21:15 meet the fugitives with bread, because of the multitude of the slain, and because of the multitude of them that lose their way, and because of the multitude of swords, and because of the multitude of bent bows, and because of the multitude of them that have fallen in war.
21:16 For thus said the Lord to me, Yet a year, as the year of an hireling,
21:17 and the remnant of the strong bows of the sons of Kedar shall be small: for the Lord God of Israel has spoken
22:1 The Word of the Valley of Sion.
22:2 The city is filled with shouting
22:3 All thy princes have fled, and
22:4 Therefore I said, Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me for the breach of the daughter of my people.
22:5 For
22:6 And the Elamites took
22:7 And it shall be
22:8 And they shall uncover the gates of Juda, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city.
22:9 And they shall uncover the secret places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were many, and that one
22:10 and that they
22:11 And ye procured to yourselves water between the two walls within the ancient pool: but ye looked not to him that made it from the beginning, and regarded not him that created it.
22:12 And the Lord, the Lord of hosts, called in that day for weeping, and lamentation, and baldness, and for girding with sackcloth:
22:13 but they engaged in joy and gladness, slaying calves, and killing sheep, so as to eat flesh, and drink wine; saying, Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die.
22:14 And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of hosts: for this sin shall not be forgiven you, until ye die.
22:15 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Go into the chamber, to Somnas the treasurer, and say to him, Why art thou here?
22:16 and what hast thou to do here, that thou hast here hewn thyself a sepulchre, and madest thyself a sepulchre on high, and hast graven for thyself a dwelling in the rock?
22:17 Behold now, the Lord of hosts casts forth and will utterly destroy
22:18 and will cast thee into a great and unmeasured land, and there thou shalt die: and he will bring thy fair chariot to shame, and the house of thy prince to be trodden down.
22:19 And thou shalt be removed from thy stewardship, and from thy place.
22:20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Chelcias:
22:21 and I will put on him thy robe, and I will grant him thy crown with power, and I will give thy stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Juda.
22:22 And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him the key of the house of David
22:23 And I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his father's house.
22:24 And every one that is glorious in the house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and they shall depend upon him in that day.
22:25 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The man that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord has spoken it.
23:1 The Word concerning Tyre.
23:2 To whom are the dwellers in the island become like, the merchants of Phœnice, passing over the sea
23:3 in great waters, a generation of merchants? as when the harvest is gathered in,
23:4 Be ashamed, O Sidon: the sea has said, yea, the strength of the sea has said, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor have I brought up young men, nor reared virgins.
23:5 Moreover when it shall be heard in Egypt, sorrow shall seize them for Tyre.
23:6 Depart ye to Carthage; howl, ye that dwell in this island.
23:7 Was not this your pride from the beginning, before she was given up?
23:8 Who has devised this counsel against Tyre? Is she inferior? or has she no strength? her merchants were the glorious princes of the earth.
23:9 The Lord of hosts has purposed to bring down all the pride of the glorious ones, and to disgrace every glorious thing on the earth.
23:10 Till thy land; for ships no more come out of Carthage.
23:11 And thy hand prevails no more by sea, which troubled kings: the Lord of hosts has given a command concerning Chanaan, to destroy the strength thereof.
23:12 And
23:13 And
23:14 Howl, ye ships of Carthage: for your strong hold is destroyed.
23:15 And it shall come to pass in that day,
23:16 Take a harp, go about, O city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; play well on the harp, sing many
23:17 And it shall come to pass after the seventy years,
23:18 And her trade and her gain shall be holiness to the Lord: it shall not be gathered for them, but for those that dwell before the Lord,
24:1 Behold, the Lord is about to lay waste the world, and will make it desolate, and will lay bare the surface of it, and scatter them that dwell therein.
24:2 And the people shall be as the priest, and the servant as the lord, and the maid as the mistress; the buyer shall be as the seller, the lender as the borrower, and the debtor as his creditor.
24:3 The earth shall be completely laid waste, and the earth shall be utterly spoiled: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.
24:4 The earth mourns, and the world is ruined, the lofty ones of the earth are mourning.
24:5 And she has sinned by reason of her inhabitants; because they have transgressed the law, and changed the ordinances,
24:6 Therefore a curse shall consume the earth, because the inhabitants thereof have sinned: therefore the dwellers in the earth shall be poor, and few men shall be left.
24:7 The wine shall mourn, the vine shall mourn, all the merry-hearted shall sigh.
24:8 The mirth of timbrels has ceased, the sound of the harp has ceased.
24:9 They are ashamed, they have not drunk wine; strong drink has become bitter to them that drink
24:10 All the city has become desolate: one shall shut his house so that none shall enter.
24:11 There is a howling for the wine everywhere; all the mirth of the land has ceased, all the mirth of the land has departed.
24:12 And cities shall be left desolate, and houses being left shall fall to ruin.
24:13 All this shall be in the land in the midst of the nations, as if one should strip an olive tree, so shall they strip them; but when the vintage is done,
24:14 these shall cry aloud; and they that are left on the land shall rejoice together in the glory of the Lord: the water of the sea shall be troubled.
24:15 Therefore shall the glory of the Lord be in the isles of the sea; the name of the Lord shall be glorious.
24:16 O Lord God of Israel, from the ends of the earth we have heard wonderful things,
24:17 Fear, and a pit, and a snare, are upon you that dwell on the earth.
24:18 And it shall come to pass,
24:19 the earth shall be utterly confounded, and the earth shall be completely perplexed.
24:20 It reels as a drunkard and one oppressed with wine, and the earth shall be shaken as a storehouse of fruits; for iniquity has prevailed upon it, and it shall fall, and shall not be able to rise.
24:21 And God shall bring
24:22 And they shall gather the multitude thereof into prisons, and they shall shut them into a strong hold: after many generations they shall be visited.
24:23 And the brick shall decay, and the wall shall fall; for the Lord shall reign from out of Sion, and out of Jerusalem, and shall be glorified before
25:1 O Lord God, I will glorify thee, I will sing to thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things,
25:2 For thou hast made cities a heap,
25:3 Therefore shall the poor people bless thee, and cities of injured men shall bless thee.
25:4 For thou hast been a helper to every lowly city, and a shelter to them that were disheartened by reason of poverty: thou shalt deliver them from wicked men:
25:5 We were
25:6 And the Lord of hosts shall make
25:7 they shall anoint themselves with ointment in this mountain. Impart thou all these things to the nations; for this is
25:8 Death has prevailed and swallowed
25:9 And in that day they shall say, Behold our God in whom we have trusted, and he shall save us: this
25:10 God will give rest on this mountain, and the country of Moab shall be trodden down, as they tread the floor with waggons.
25:11 And he shall spread forth his hands, even as he also brings down
25:12 And he shall bring down the height of the refuge of the wall, and it shall come down even to the ground.
26:1 In that day they shall sing this song in the land of Judea; Behold a strong city; and he shall make salvation
26:2 Open ye the gates, let the nation enter that keeps righteousness, and keeps truth,
26:3 supporting truth, and keeping peace: for on thee, O Lord,
26:4 they have trusted with confidence for ever, the great, the eternal God;
26:5 who hast humbled and brought down them that dwell on high, thou shalt cast down strong cities, and bring them to the ground.
26:6 And the feet of the meek and lowly shall trample them.
26:7 The way of the godly is made straight: the way of the godly is also prepared.
26:8 For the way of the Lord is judgment: we have hoped in thy name, and on the remembrance
26:9 which our soul longs for: my spirit seeks thee very early in the morning, O God, for thy commandments are a light on the earth: learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth.
26:10 For the ungodly one is put down: no one who will not learn righteousness on the earth, shall be able to do the truth: let the ungodly be taken away, that he see not the glory of the Lord.
26:11 O Lord, thine arm is exalted, yet they knew it not: but when they know they shall be ashamed: jealousy shall seize upon an untaught nation, and now fire shall devour the adversaries.
26:12 O Lord our God, give us peace: for thou hast rendered to us all things.
26:13 O Lord our God, take possession of us: O Lord, we know not
26:14 But the dead shall not see life, neither shall physicians by any means raise
26:15 bring more evils on the glorious ones of the earth.
26:16 Lord, in affliction I remembered thee; thy chastening was to us with small affliction.
26:17 And as a woman in travail draws nigh to be delivered,
26:18 We have conceived, O Lord, because of thy fear, and have been in pain, and have brought forth the breath of thy salvation, which we have wrought upon the earth: we shall not fall, but all that dwell upon the land shall fall.
26:19 The dead shall rise, and they that are in the tombs shall be raised, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew from thee is healing to them: but the land of the ungodly shall perish.
26:20 Go, my people, enter into thy closets, shut thy door, hide thyself for a little season, until the anger of the Lord have passed away.
26:21 For, behold, the Lord is bringing wrath from
27:1 In that day God shall bring
27:2 In that day
27:3 I am a strong city, a city in a siege: in vain shall I water it; for it shall be taken by night, and by day the wall shall fall.
27:4 There is no woman that has not taken hold of it; who will set me to watch stubble in the field? because of this enemy I have set her aside; therefore on this account the Lord has done all that he appointed.
27:5 I am burnt up; they that dwell in her shall cry, Let us make peace with him, let us make peace,
27:6 they that are coming are the children of Jacob. Israel shall bud and blossom, and the world shall be filled with his fruit.
27:7 Shall he himself be thus smitten, even as he smote? and as he slew, shall he be thus slain?
27:8 Fighting and reproaching he will dismiss them; didst thou not meditate with a harsh spirit, to slay them with a wrathful spirit?
27:9 Therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be taken away; and this is his blessing, when I shall have taken away his sin; when they shall have broken to pieces all the stones of the altars as fine dust, and their trees shall not remain, and their idols shall be cut off, as a thicket afar off.
27:10 The flock that dwelt
27:11 And after a time there shall be in it no green thing because of
27:12 And it shall come to pass in that day
27:13 And it shall come to pass in that day,
28:1 Woe to the crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, the flower that has fallen from the glory of the top of the fertile mountain, they that are drunken without wine.
28:2 Behold, the anger of the Lord is strong and severe, as descending hail where there is no shelter, violently descending; as a great body of water sweeping away the soil, he shall make rest for the land.
28:3 The crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, shall be beaten down with the hands and with the feet.
28:4 And the fading flower of the glorious hope on the top of the high mountain shall be as the early fig; he that sees it, before he takes it into his hand, will desire to swallow it down.
28:5 In that day the Lord of hosts shall be the crown of hope, the woven
28:6 They shall be left in the spirit of judgment for judgment, and for the strength of them that hinder slaying.
28:7 For these have trespassed through wine; they have erred through strong drink: the priest and the prophet are mad through strong drink, they are swallowed up by reason of wine, they have staggered through drunkenness; they have erred: this is
28:8 A curse shall devour this counsel, for this
28:9 To whom have we reported evils? and to whom have we reported a message?
28:10 Expect thou affliction on affliction, hope upon hope: yet a little,
28:11 by reason of the contemptuous
28:12 This is the rest to him that is hungry, and this is the calamity: but they would not hear.
28:13 Therefore the oracle of God shall be to them affliction on affliction, hope on hope, yet a little,
28:14 Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, ye afflicted men, and ye princes of this people that is in Jerusalem.
28:15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with Hades, and agreements with death; if the rushing storm should pass, it shall not come upon us: we have made falsehood our hope, and by falsehood shall we be protected:
28:16 therefore thus saith the Lord,
28:17 And I will cause judgment
28:18 except it also take away your covenant of death, and your trust in Hades shall by no means stand: if the rushing storm should come upon you, ye shall be beaten down by it.
28:19 Whenever it shall pass by, it shall take you; morning by morning it shall pass by in the day, and in the night there shall be an evil hope.
28:20 ye that are distressed; we cannot fight, but we are ourselves too weak for you to be gathered.
28:21 The Lord shall rise up as a mountain of ungodly
28:22 Therefore do not ye rejoice, neither let your bands be made strong; for I have heard of works finished and cut short by the Lord of hosts, which he will execute upon all the earth.
28:23 Hearken, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my words.
28:24 Will the ploughman plough all the day? or will he prepare the seed beforehand, before he tills the ground?
28:25 Does he not, when he has levelled the surface thereof, then sow the small black poppy, or cumin, and afterward sow wheat, and barley, and millet, and bread-corn in thy borders?
28:26 So thou shalt be chastened by the judgment of thy God, and shalt rejoice.
28:27 For the black poppy is not cleansed with harsh treatment, nor will a waggon-wheel pass over the cumin; but the black poppy is threshed with a rod, and the cumin shall be eaten with bread;
28:28 for I will not be wroth with you for ever, neither shall the voice of my anger crush you.
28:29 And these signs came forth from the Lord of hosts. Take counsel, exalt vain comfort.
29:1 Alas for the city Ariel, which David besieged. Gather ye fruits year by year; eat ye, for ye shall eat with Moab.
29:2 For I will grievously afflict Ariel: and her strength and her wealth shall be mine.
29:3 And I will compass thee about like David, and will raise a mound about thee, and set up towers round thee.
29:4 And thy words shall be brought down to the earth, and thy words shall sink down to the earth, and thy voice shall be as they that speak out of the earth, and thy voice shall be lowered to the ground.
29:5 But the wealth of the ungodly shall be as dust from a wheel, and the multitude of them that oppress thee as flying chaff, and it shall be suddenly as a moment,
29:6 from the Lord of hosts: for there shall be a visitation with thunder, and earthquake, and a loud noise, a rushing tempest, and devouring flame of fire.
29:7 And the wealth of all the nations together, as many as have fought against Ariel, and all they that war against Jerusalem, and all who are gathered against her, and they that distress her, shall be as one that dreams in sleep by night.
29:8 And as men drink and eat in sleep, and when they have arisen, the dream is vain: and as a thirsty man dreams as if he drank, and having arisen is still thirsty, and his soul has desired in vain: so shall be the wealth of all the nations, as many as have fought against the mount Sion.
29:9 Faint ye, and be amazed, and be overpowered, not with strong drink nor with wine.
29:10 For the Lord has made you to drink a spirit of deep sleep; and he shall close their eyes, and
29:11 And all these things shall be to you as the words of this sealed book, which if they shall give to a learned man, saying, Read this, he shall then say, I cannot read
29:12 And this book shall be given into the hands of a man that is unlearned, and
29:13 And the Lord has said, This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, and they honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me: but in vain do they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men.
29:14 Therefore behold I will proceed to remove this people, and I will remove them: and I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will hide the understanding of the prudent.
29:15 Woe to them that deepen their counsel, and not by the Lord. Woe to them that take secret counsel, and whose works are in darkness, and they say, Who has seen us? and who shall know us, or what we do?
29:16 Shall ye not be counted as clay of the potter? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Thou didst not form me? or the work to the maker, Thou hast not made me wisely?
29:17 Is it
29:18 And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and they that are in darkness, and they that are in mist: the eyes of the blind shall see,
29:19 and the poor shall rejoice with joy because of the Lord, and they that had no hope among men shall be filled with joy.
29:20 The lawless man has come to nought, and the proud man has perished, and they that transgress mischievously have been utterly destroyed:
29:21 and they that cause men to sin by a word: and men shall make all that reprove in the gates an offence, because they have unjustly turned aside the righteous.
29:22 Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the house of Jacob, whom he set apart from Abraam, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall he now change countenance.
29:23 But when their children shall have seen my works, they shall sanctify my name for my sake, and they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
29:24 And they that erred in spirit shall know understanding, and the murmurers shall learn obedience, and the stammering tongues shall learn to speak peace.
30:1 Woe to the apostate children, saith the Lord: ye have framed counsel, not by me, and covenants not by my Spirit, to add sins to sins:
30:2 even
30:3 For the protection of Pharao shall be to you a disgrace, and
30:4 For there are princes in Tanes, evil messengers.
30:5 In vain shall they labour
30:6 The Vision of the Quadrupeds in the Desert.
30:7 The Egyptians shall help you utterly in vain: tell them, This your consolation is vain.
30:8 Now then sit down and write these words on a tablet, and in a book; for these things shall be for
30:9 For the people is disobedient, false children, who would not hear the law of God:
30:10 who say to the prophets, Report not to us; and to them that see visions, Speak
30:11 and turn us aside from this way; remove from us this path, and remove from us the oracle of Israel.
30:12 Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye have refused to obey these words, and have trusted in falsehood; and because thou hast murmured, and been confident in this respect:
30:13 therefore shall this sin be to you as a wall suddenly falling when a strong city has been taken, of which the fall is very near at hand.
30:14 And the fall thereof shall be as the breaking of an earthen vessel,
30:15 Thus saith the Lord, the Holy Lord of Israel; When thou shalt turn and mourn, then thou shalt be saved; and thou shalt know where thou wast, when thou didst trust in vanities:
30:16 but ye said, We will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will be aided by swift riders; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
30:17 A thousand shall flee because of the voice of one, and many shall flee on account of the voice of five; until ye be left as a signal-post upon a mountain, and as one bearing an ensign upon a hill.
30:18 And the Lord will again wait, that he may pity you, and will therefore be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: because the Lord your God is a judge: blessed are they that stay themselves upon him.
30:19 For the holy people shall dwell in Sion: and
30:20 And
30:21 and thine ears shall hear the words of them that went after thee to lead thee astray, who say, This
30:22 And thou shalt pollute the plated idols, and thou shalt grind to powder the gilt ones, and shalt scatter them as the water of a removed
30:23 Then shall there be rain to the seed of thy land; and the bread of the fruit of thy land shall be plenteous and rich: and thy cattle shall feed in that day in a fertile and spacious place.
30:24 Your bulls and your oxen that till the ground, shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley.
30:25 And there shall be upon every lofty mountain and upon every high hill, water running in that day, when many shall perish, and when the towers shall fall.
30:26 And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold in the day when the Lord shall heal the breach of his people, and shall heal the pain of thy wound.
30:27 Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a
30:28 And his breath, as rushing water in a valley, shall reach as far as the neck, and be divided, to confound the nations for
30:29 Must ye always rejoice, and go into my holy places continually, as they that keep a feast? and must ye go with a pipe, as those that rejoice, into the mountain of the Lord, to the God of Israel?
30:30 And the Lord shall make his glorious voice to be heard, and the wrath of his arm, to make a display with wrath and anger and devouring flame: he shall lighten terribly, and
30:31 For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome,
30:32 And it shall happen to him from every side,
30:33 For thou shalt be required before
31:1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, who trust in horses and chariots, for they are many; and in horses,
31:2 Therefore he has wisely brought evils upon them, and his word shall not be frustrated; and he shall rise up against the houses of wicked men, and against their vain hope,
31:3 even
31:4 For thus said the Lord to me, As a lion would roar, or a lion's whelp over prey which he has taken, and cry over it, until the mountains are filled with his voice, and
31:5 As birds flying, so shall the Lord of hosts defend; he shall defend Jerusalem, and he shall rescue, and save and deliver.
31:6 Turn, ye children of Israel, who devise a deep and sinful counsel.
31:7 For in that day men shall renounce their silver idols and
31:8 And the Assyrian shall fall: not the sword of a great man, nor the sword of a mean man shall devour him; neither shall he flee from the face of the sword: but the young men shall be overthrown:
31:9 for they shall be compassed with rocks as with a trench, and shall be worsted; and he that flees shall be taken. Thus saith the Lord, Blessed is he that has a seed in Sion, and household friends in Jerusalem.
32:1 For, behold, a righteous king shall reign, and princes shall govern with judgment.
32:2 And a man shall hide his words, and be hidden, as from rushing water, and shall appear in Sion as a rushing river, glorious in a thirsty land.
32:3 And they shall no more trust in men, but they shall incline their ears to hear.
32:4 And the heart of the weak ones shall attend to hear, and the stammering tongues shall soon learn to speak peace.
32:5 And they shall no more at all tell a fool to rule, and thy servants shall no more at all say, Be silent.
32:6 For the fool shall speak foolish words, and his heart shall meditate vanities, and to perform lawless deeds and to speak error against the Lord, to scatter hungry souls, and he will cause the thirsty souls to be empty.
32:7 For the counsel of the wicked will devise iniquity, to destroy the poor with unjust words, and ruin the cause of the poor in judgment.
32:8 But the godly have devised wise
32:9 Rise up, ye rich women, and hear my voice; ye confident daughters, hearken to my words.
32:10 Remember for a full year in pain, yet with hope: the vintage has been cut off, it has ceased, it shall by no means come again.
32:11 Be amazed, be pained, ye confident ones: strip you, bare yourselves, gird your loins;
32:12 and beat on your breasts, because of the pleasant field, and the fruit of the vine.
32:13 As for
32:14 As for
32:15 until the Spirit shall come upon you from on high, and Chermel shall be desert, and Chermel shall be counted for a forest.
32:16 Then judgment shall abide in the wilderness, and righteousness shall dwell in Carmel.
32:17 And the works of righteousness shall be peace; and righteousness shall ensure rest, and
32:18 And his people shall inhabit a city of peace, and dwell in
32:19 And if the hail should come down, it shall not come upon you; and they that dwell in the forests shall be in confidence, as those in the plain country.
32:20 Blessed are they that sow by every water, where the ox and ass tread.
33:1 Woe to them that afflict you; but no one makes you miserable: and he that deals perfidiously with you does not deal perfidiously: they that deal perfidiously shall be taken and given up, and as a moth on a garment, so shall they be spoiled.
33:2 Lord, have mercy upon us; for we have trusted in thee: the seed of the rebellious is gone to destruction, but our deliverance was in a time of affliction.
33:3 By reason of the terrible sound the nations were dismayed for fear of thee, and the heathen were scattered.
33:4 And now shall the spoils of your small and great be gathered: as if one should gather locusts, so shall they mock you.
33:5 The God who dwells on high is holy: Sion is filled with judgment and righteousness.
33:6 They shall be delivered up to the law: our salvation is our treasure: there are wisdom and knowledge and piety toward the Lord; these are the treasures of righteousness.
33:7 Behold now, these shall be terrified with fear of you: those whom ye feared shall cry out because of you: messengers shall be sent, bitterly weeping, entreating for peace.
33:8 For the ways of these shall be made desolate: the terror of the nations has been made to cease, and the covenant with these is taken away, and ye shall by no means deem them men.
33:9 The land mourns; Libanus is ashamed: Saron is become marshes; Galilee shall be laid bare, and Chermel.
33:10 Now will I arise, saith the Lord, now will I be glorified; now will I be exalted.
33:11 Now shall ye see, now shall ye perceive; the strength of your breath shall be vain; fire shall devour you.
33:12 And the nations shall be burnt up; as a thorn in the field cast out and burnt up.
33:13 They that are afar off shall hear what I have done; they that draw nigh shall know my strength.
33:14 The sinners in Sion have departed; trembling shall seize the ungodly. Who will tell you that a fire is kindled? Who will tell you of the eternal place?
33:15 He that walks in righteousness, speaking rightly, hating transgression and iniquity, and shaking his hands from gifts, stopping his ears that he should not hear the judgment of blood, shutting his eyes that he should not see injustice;
33:16 he shall dwell in a high cave of a strong rock: bread shall be given him, and his water shall be sure.
33:17 Ye shall see a king with glory: your eyes shall behold a land from afar.
33:18 Your soul shall meditate terror. Where are the scribes? where are the counsellors, where is he that numbers them that are growing up,
33:19 even
33:20 Behold the city Sion, our refuge: thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem, a rich city, tabernacles which shall not be shaken, neither shall the pins of her tabernacle be moved for ever, neither shall her cords be at all broken:
33:21 for the name of the Lord is great to you: ye shall have a place,
33:22 For my God is great: the Lord our judge shall not pass me by: the Lord is our prince, the Lord is our king; the Lord, he shall save us.
33:23 Thy cords are broken, for they had no strength: thy mast has given way, it shall not spread the sails, it shall not bear a signal, until it be given up for plunder; therefore shall many lame men take spoil.
33:24 And the people dwelling among them shall by no means say, I am in pain: for their sin shall be forgiven them.
34:1 Draw near, ye nations; and hearken, ye princes; let the earth hear, and they that are in it; the world, and the people that are therein.
34:2 For the wrath of the Lord is upon all nations, and
34:3 And their slain shall be cast forth, and their corpses; and their
34:4 And all the powers of the heavens shall melt, and the sky shall be rolled up like a scroll: and all the stars shall fall like leaves from a vine, and as leaves fall from a fig-tree.
34:5 My sword has been made drunk in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and with judgment upon the people doomed to destruction.
34:6 The sword of the Lord is filled with blood, it is glutted with fat, with the blood of goats and lambs, and with the fat of goats and rams: for the Lord has a sacrifice in Bosor, and a great slaughter in Idumea.
34:7 And the mighty ones shall fall with them, and the rams and the bulls; and the land shall be soaked with blood, and shall be filled with their fat.
34:8 For it is the day of the judgment of the Lord, and the year of the recompence of Sion in judgment.
34:9 And her valleys shall be turned into pitch, and her land into sulphur; and her land shall be as pitch burning night and day;
34:10 and it shall never be quenched, and her smoke shall go up: it shall be made desolate throughout her generations,
34:11 and for a long time birds and hedgehogs, and ibises and ravens shall dwell in it: and the measuring line of desolation shall be cast over it, and satyrs shall dwell in it.
34:12 Her princes shall be no more; for her kings and her great men shall be destroyed.
34:13 And thorns shall spring up in their cities, and in her strong holds: and they shall be habitations of monsters, and a court for ostriches.
34:14 And devils shall meet with satyrs, and they shall cry one to the other: there shall satyrs rest, having found for themselves
34:15 There has the hedgehog made its nest, and the earth has safely preserved its young: there have the deer met, and seen one another's faces.
34:16 They passed by in
34:17 And he shall cast lots for them, and his hand has portioned out
35:1 Be glad, thou thirsty desert: let the wilderness exult, and flower as the lily.
35:2 And the desert places of Jordan shall blossom and rejoice; the glory of Libanus has been given to it, and the honour of Carmel; and my people shall see the glory of the Lord, and the majesty of God.
35:3 Be strong, ye relaxed hands and palsied knees.
35:4 Comfort one another, ye faint-hearted; be strong, fear not; behold, our God renders judgment, and he will render
35:5 Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear.
35:6 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall speak plainly; for water has burst forth in the desert, and a channel
35:7 And the dry land shall become pools, and a fountain of water shall
35:8 There shall be there a pure way, and it shall be called a holy way; and there shall not pass by there any unclean person, neither shall there be there an unclean way; but the dispersed shall walk on it, and they shall not go astray.
35:9 And there shall be no lion there, neither shall any evil beast go up upon it, nor at all be found there; but the redeemed and gathered on the Lord's behalf, shall walk in it,
35:10 and shall return, and come to Sion with joy, and everlasting joy
36:1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of the reign of Ezekias,
36:2 And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces out of Laches to Jerusalem to king Ezekias with a large force: and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller's field.
36:3 And there went forth to him Heliakim the steward, the
36:4 And Rabsaces said to them, Say to Ezekias, Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians, Why art thou secure?
36:5 Is war carried on with counsel and
36:6 Behold, thou trustest on this bruised staff of reed, on Egypt:
36:7 But if ye say, We trust in the Lord our God;
36:8 yet now make an agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if ye shall be able to set riders upon them.
36:9 And how can ye
36:10 And now, Have we come up against this land to fight against it without the Lord? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
36:11 Then Eliakim and Somnas and Joach said to him, Speak to thy servants in the Syrian tongue; for we understand
36:12 And Rabsaces said to them, Has my lord sent me to your lord or to you, to speak these words?
36:13 And Rabsaces stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians:
36:14 thus says the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you with words: he will not be able to deliver you.
36:15 And let not Ezekias say to you, That God will deliver you, and this city will not at all be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
36:16 Hearken not to Ezekias: thus says the king of the Assyrians, If ye wish to be blessed, come out to me: and ye shall eat every one
36:17 until I come and take you to a land, like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread and vineyards.
36:18 Let not Ezekias deceive you, saying, God will deliver you. Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?
36:19 Where is the god of Emath, and Arphath? and where is the god of Eppharuaim? have they been able to deliver Samaria out of my hand?
36:20 Which is the god of all these nations, that has delivered his land out of my hand, that God should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
36:21 And they were silent, and none answered him a word; because the king had commanded that none should answer.
36:22 And Heliakim the
37:1 And it came to pass, when king Ezekias heard
37:2 And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the son of Amos, the prophet. And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias,
37:3 To-day is a day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are come upon the travailing
37:4 May the Lord thy God hear the words of Rabsaces, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord thy God has heard: therefore thou shalt pray to thy Lord for these that are left.
37:5 So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.
37:6 And Esaias said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not thou afraid at the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me.
37:7 Behold, I
37:8 So Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachis.
37:9 And Tharaca king of the Ethiopians went forth to attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,
37:10 Thus shall ye say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
37:11 Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have destroyed the whole earth? and shalt thou be delivered?
37:12 Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Charrhan, and Rapheth, which are in the land of Theemath?
37:13 Where are the kings of Emath? and where
37:14 And Ezekias received the letter from the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it before the Lord.
37:15 And Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying,
37:16 O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubs, thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world: thou hast made heaven and earth.
37:17 Incline thine ear, O Lord, hearken, O Lord; open thine eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
37:18 For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof,
37:19 and have cast their idols into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have cast them away.
37:20 But now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that thou art God alone.
37:21 And Esaias the son of Amos was sent to Ezekias, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.
37:22 This is the word which God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Sion has despised thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
37:23 Whom hast thou reproached and provoked? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice? and hast thou not lifted up thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel?
37:24 For thou hast reproached the Lord by messengers; for thou hast said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the height of mountains, and to the sides of Libanus; and I have cropped the height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the height of the forest region:
37:25 and I have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water.
37:26 Hast thou not heard of these things which I did of old? I appointed
37:27 I weakened
37:28 But now I know thy rest, and thy going out, and thy coming in.
37:29 And thy wrath wherewith thou hast been enraged, and thy rancour has come up to me; therefore I will put a hook in thy nose, and a bit in thy lips, and will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
37:30 And this shall be a sign to thee, Eat this year what thou hast sown; and the second year that which is left: and the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
37:31 And they that are left in Judea shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
37:32 for out of Jerusalem there shall be a remnant, and the saved ones out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.
37:33 Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, nor cast a weapon against it, nor bring a shield against it, nor make a rampart round it.
37:34 But by the way by which he came, by it shall he return, and shall not enter into this city: thus saith the Lord.
37:35 I will protect this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
37:36 And the angel of the Lord went forth, and slew out of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they arose in the morning and found all
37:37 And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians turned and departed, and dwelt in Nineve.
37:38 And while he was worshipping Nasarach his country's god in the house, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons smote him with swords; and they escaped into Armenia: and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.
38:1 And it came to pass at that time,
38:2 And Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,
38:3 Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, with a true heart, and have done that which was pleasing in thy sight. And Ezekias wept bitterly.
38:4 And the word of the Lord came to Esaias, saying, Go, and say to Ezekias,
38:5 Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, and seen thy tears: behold, I
38:6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians: and I will defend this city.
38:7 And this
38:8 behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees
38:9 The Prayer of Ezekias king of Judea, when he
38:10 I said in the end of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I shall part with the remainder of my years.
38:11 I said, I shall no more at all see the salvation of God in the land of the living: I shall no more at all see the salvation of Israel on the earth: I shall no more at all see man.
38:12 My life
38:13 In that day I was given up as to a lion until the morning: so has he broken all my bones: for I was so given up from day
38:14 As a swallow, so will I cry, and as a dove, so do I mourn: for mine eyes have failed with looking to the height of heaven to the Lord, who has delivered me,
38:15 and removed the sorrow of my soul.
38:16 Yea
38:17 For thou hast chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and thou hast cast all
38:18 For they that are in the grave shall not praise thee, neither shall the dead bless thee, neither shall they that are in Hades hope for thy mercy.
38:19 The living shall bless thee, as I also
38:20 O God of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing thee with the psaltery all the days of my life before the house of God.
38:21 Now Esaias had said to Ezekias; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaister, and thou shalt be well.
38:22 And Ezekias said, This is a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God.
39:1 At that time Marodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylonia, sent letters and ambassadors and gifts to Ezekias: for he had heard that he had been sick
39:2 And Ezekias was glad of their coming, and he shewed them the house of
39:3 And Esaias the prophet came to king Ezekias, and said to him, What say these men? and whence came they to thee? and Ezekias said, They are come to me from a land afar off, from Babylon.
39:4 And Esaias said, What have they seen in thine house? and Ezekias said, They have seen everything in my house; and there is nothing in my house which they have not seen: yea, also the
39:5 And Esaias said to him, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:
39:6 Behold, the days come, when they shall take all the
39:7 that they shall take also of thy children whom thou shalt beget; and they shall make them eunuchs in the house of the king of the Babylonians.
39:8 And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord, which he hath spoken: let there, I pray, be peace and righteousness in my days.
40:1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith God.
40:2 Speak, ye priests, to the heart of Jerusalem; comfort her, for her humiliation is accomplished, her sin is put away: for she has received of the Lord's hand double
40:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God.
40:4 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and all the crooked
40:5 And the glory of the Lord shall appear, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God: for the Lord has spoken
40:6 The voice of one saying, Cry; and I said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.
40:7 The grass withers, and the flower fades:
40:8 but the word of our God abides for ever.
40:9 O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion, go up on the high mountain; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, fear not; say unto the cities of Juda, Behold your God!
40:10 Behold the Lord! The Lord is coming with strength, and
40:11 He shall tend his flock as a shepherd, and he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and shall soothe them that are with young.
40:12 Who has measured the water in his hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth in a handful? Who has weighed the mountains in scales, and the forests in a balance?
40:13 Who has known the mind of the Lord? and who has been his counsellor, to instruct him?
40:14 Or with whom has he taken counsel, and he has instructed him? or who has taught him judgment, or who has taught him the way of understanding;
40:15 since all the nations are counted as a drop from a bucket, and as the turning of a balance,
40:16 And Libanus is not enough to burn, nor all beasts enough for a whole-burnt offering:
40:17 and all the nations are as nothing, and counted as nothing.
40:18 To whom have ye compared the Lord? and with what likeness have ye compared him?
40:19 Has not the artificer made an image, or the goldsmith having melted gold, gilt it over,
40:20 For the artificer chooses out a wood that will not rot, and will wisely enquire how he shall set up his image, and
40:21 Will ye not know? will ye not hear? has it not been told you of old? Have ye not known the foundations of the earth?
40:22 It is
40:23 he that appoints princes to rule as nothing, and has made the earth as nothing.
40:24 For they shall not plant, neither shall they sow, neither shall their root be fixed in the ground: he has blown upon them, and they are withered, and a storm shall carry them away like sticks.
40:25 Now then to whom have ye compared me, that I may be exalted? saith the Holy One.
40:26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see, who has displayed all these things?
40:27 For say not thou, O Jacob, and why hast thou spoken, Israel,
40:28 And now, hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the eternal God, the God that formed the ends of the earth, shall not hunger, nor be weary, and there is no searching of his understanding.
40:29 He gives strength to the hungry, and sorrow to them that are not suffering.
40:30 For the young
40:31 but they that wait on God shall renew
41:1 Hold a feast to me, ye islands: for the princes shall renew
41:2 Who raised up righteousness from the east,
41:3 And he shall pursue them; the way of his feet shall proceed in peace.
41:4 Who has wrought and done these things? he has called it who called it from the generations of old; I God, the first and to
41:5 The nations saw, and feared; the ends of the earth drew nigh, and came together,
41:6 every one judging for his neighbour and
41:7 The artificer has become strong, and the coppersmith that smites with the hammer,
41:8 But thou, Israel, art my servant Jacob, and he whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraam, whom I have loved:
41:9 whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and from the high places of it I have called thee, and said to thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and I have not forsaken thee.
41:10 Fear not; for I am with thee: wander not; for I am thy God, who have strengthened thee; and I have helped thee, and have established thee with my just right hand.
41:11 Behold, all thine adversaries shall be ashamed and confounded; for they shall be as if they were not: and all thine opponents shall perish.
41:12 Thou shalt seek them, and thou shalt not find the men who shall insolently rage against thee: for they shall be as if they were not, and they that war against thee shall not be.
41:13 For I am thy God, who holdeth thy right hand, who saith to thee,
41:14 Fear not, Jacob,
41:15 Behold, I have made thee as new saw-shaped threshing wheels of a waggon; and thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat the hills to powder, and make
41:16 and thou shalt winnow
41:17 And the poor and the needy shall exult; for
41:18 but I will open rivers on the mountains, and fountains in the midst of plains: I will make the desert pools of water, and a thirsty land watercourses.
41:19 I will plant in the dry land the cedar and box, the myrtle and cypress, and white poplar:
41:20 that they may see, and know, and perceive, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord has wrought these
41:21 Your judgment draws nigh, saith the Lord God; your counsels have drawn nigh, saith the King of Jacob.
41:22 Let them draw nigh, and declare to you what things shall come to pass; or tell
41:23 tell us, declare ye to us the things that are coming on at the last
41:24 whence ye are, and whence is your work: they have chosen you an abomination out of the earth.
41:25 But I have raised up him that
41:26 For who will declare the things from the beginning, that we may know also the former things, and we will say that they are true? there is no one that speaks beforehand, nor any one that hears your words.
41:27 I will give dominion to Sion, and will comfort Jerusalem by the way.
41:28 For from among the nations, behold,
41:29 For
42:1 Jacob is my servant, I will help him: Israel is my chosen, my soul has accepted him; I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
42:2 He shall not cry, nor lift up
42:3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; but he shall bring forth judgment to truth.
42:4 He shall shine out, and shall not be discouraged, until he have set judgment on the earth: and in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
42:5 Thus saith the Lord God, who made the heaven, and established it; who settled the earth, and the things in it, and gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to them that tread on it:
42:6 I the Lord God have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will strengthen thee: and I have given thee for the covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles;
42:7 to open the eyes of the blind, to bring the bound and them that sit in darkness out of bonds and the prison-house.
42:8 I am the Lord God: that is my name: I will not give my glory to another, nor my praises to graven images.
42:9 Behold, the ancient things have come to pass, and
42:10 Sing a new hymn to the Lord: ye
42:11 Rejoice, thou wilderness, and the villages thereof, the hamlets, and the dwellers in Kedar: the inhabitants of the rock shall rejoice, they shall shout from the top of the mountains.
42:12 They shall give glory to God,
42:13 The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, and crush the war: he shall stir up jealousy, and shall shout mightily against his enemies.
42:14 I have been silent: shall I also always be silent and forbear? I have endured like a travailing
42:15 I will make desolate mountains and hills, and will dry up all their grass; and I will make the rivers islands, and dry up the pools.
42:16 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, and I will cause them to tread paths which they have not known: I will turn darkness into light for them, and crooked things into straight. These things will I do, and will not forsake them.
42:17 But they are turned back: be ye utterly ashamed that trust in graven
42:18 Hear, ye deaf, and look up, ye blind, to see.
42:19 And who is blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that rule over them? yea, the servants of God have been made blind.
42:20 Ye have often seen, and have not taken heed;
42:21 The Lord God has taken counsel that he might be justified, and might magnify
42:22 And I beheld, and the people were spoiled and plundered: for
42:23 Who
42:24 For what did he give Jacob up to spoil, and Israel to them that plundered him? Did not God
42:25 So he brought upon them the fury of his wrath; and the war, and those that burnt round about them, prevailed against them; yet no one of them knew
43:1 And now thus saith the Lord God that made thee, O Jacob, and formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee
43:2 And if thou pass through water, I am with thee; and the rivers shall not overflow thee: and if thou go through fire, thou shalt not be burned; the flame shall not burn thee.
43:3 For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, that saves thee: I have made Egypt and Ethiopia thy ransom, and
43:4 Since thou becamest precious in my sight, thou hast become glorious, and I have loved thee: and I will give men for thee, and princes for thy life.
43:5 Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and will gather thee from the west.
43:6 I will say to the north, Bring; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from the
43:7 even
43:8 and I have brought forth the blind people; for
43:9 All the nations are gathered together, and princes shall be gathered out of them: who will declare these things? or who will declare to you things from the beginning? let them bring forth their witnesses, and be justified; and let them hear, and declare the truth.
43:10 Be ye my witnesses, and I
43:11 I am God; and beside me there is no Saviour.
43:12 I have declared, and have saved; I have reproached, and there was no strange
43:13 even from the beginning; and there is none that can deliver out of my hands: I will work, and who shall turn it back?
43:14 Thus saith the Lord God that redeems you, the Holy One of Israel; For your sakes I will send to Babylon, and I will stir up all that flee, and the Chaldeans shall be bound in ships.
43:15 I am the Lord God, your Holy One, who have appointed for Israel your king.
43:16 Thus saith the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty water;
43:17 who brought forth chariots and horse, and a mighty multitude: but they have lain down, and shall not rise: they are extinct, as quenched flax.
43:18 Remember ye not the former things, and consider not the ancient things.
43:19 Behold, I
43:20 The beasts of the field shall bless me, the owls and young ostriches; for I have given water in the wilderness, and rivers in the dry land, to give drink to my chosen race,
43:21 even
43:22 I have not now called thee, O Jacob; neither have I made thee weary, O Israel.
43:23 Thou hast not brought me the sheep of thy whole-burnt-offering; neither hast thou glorified me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with sacrifices, neither have I wearied thee with frankincense.
43:24 Neither hast thou purchased for me victims for silver, neither have I desired the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou didst stand before me in thy sins, and in thine iniquities.
43:25 I,
43:26 But do thou remember, and let us plead
43:27 Your fathers first, and your princes have transgressed against me.
43:28 And the princes have defiled my sanctuaries: so I gave Jacob
44:1 But now hear, Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen.
44:2 Thus saith the Lord God that made thee, and he that formed thee from the womb; Thou shalt yet be helped: fear not, my servant Jacob; and beloved Israel, whom I have chosen.
44:3 For I will give water to the thirsty that walk in a dry land: I will put my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessings upon thy children:
44:4 and they shall spring up as grass between brooks, and as willows on
44:5 One shall say, I am God's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand, I am God's, and shall call himself by the name of Israel.
44:6 Thus saith God the King of Israel, and the God of hosts that delivered him; I am the first, and I am hereafter: beside me there is no God.
44:7 Who is like me? let him stand, and call, and declare, and prepare for me from the time that I made man for ever; and let them tell you the things that are coming before they arrive.
44:8 Hide not yourselves, nor go astray: have ye not heard from the beginning, and
44:9 But they that framed
44:10 that form a god, and all that grave worthless things:
44:11 and all by whom they were made are withered: yea, let all the deaf be gathered from
44:12 For the artificer sharpens the iron; he fashions
44:13 The artificer having chosen a piece of wood, marks it out with a rule, and fits it with glue, and makes it as the form of a man, and as the beauty of a man, to set it up in the house.
44:14 He cuts wood out of the forest, which the Lord planted,
44:15 that it might be for men to burn: and having taken part of it he warms himself; yea, they burn part of it, and bake loaves thereon; and
44:16 Half thereof he burns in the fire, and with half of it he bakes loaves on the coals; and having roasted flesh on it he eats, and is satisfied, and having warmed himself he says, I am comfortable, for I have warmed myself, and have seen the fire.
44:17 And the rest he makes a graven god, and worships, and prays, saying, Deliver me; for thou art my God.
44:18 They have no understanding to perceive; for they have been blinded so that they should not see with their eyes, nor perceive with their heart.
44:19 And one has not considered in his mind, nor known in his understanding, that he has burnt up half of it in the fire, and baked loaves on the coals thereof and has roasted and eaten flesh, and of the rest of it he has made an abomination, and they worship it.
44:20 Know thou that their heart is ashes, and they err, and no one is able to deliver his soul: see, ye will not say,
44:21 Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant; I have formed thee
44:22 For behold, I have blotted out as a cloud thy transgressions, and thy sin as darkness: turn to me, and I will redeem thee.
44:23 Rejoice, ye heavens; for God has had mercy upon Israel: sound the trumpet, ye foundations of the earth: ye mountains, shout
44:24 Thus saith the Lord that redeems thee, and who formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that performs all things: I stretched out the heaven alone, and established the earth.
44:25 Who else will frustrate the tokens of those that have divining spirits, and prophecies from the heart
44:26 and confirming the word of his servant, and verifying the counsel of his messengers: who says to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Idumea, Ye shall be built, and her desert places shall spring forth.
44:27 Who says to the deep, Thou shalt be dried up, and I will dry up the rivers.
44:28 Who bids Cyrus be wise, and he shall perform all my will: who says to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built, and I will lay the foundation of my holy house.
45:1 Thus saith the Lord God to my anointed Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, that nations might be obedient before him; and I will break through the strength of kings; I will open doors before him, and cities shall not be closed.
45:2 I will go before thee, and will level mountains: I will break to pieces brazen doors, and will burst iron bars.
45:3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, I will open to thee hidden, unseen
45:4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel mine elect, I will call thee by thy name, and accept thee: but thou hast not known me.
45:5 For I am the Lord God, and there is no other God beside me; I strengthened thee, and thou hast not known me.
45:6 That they that
45:7 I am he that prepared light, and formed darkness; who make peace, and create evil; I am the Lord God, that does all these things.
45:8 Let the heaven rejoice from above, and let the clouds rain righteousness: let the earth bring forth, and blossom
45:9 What excellent thing have I prepared as clay of the potter? Will the ploughman plough the earth all day? shall the clay say to the potter, What art thou doing that thou dost not work, nor hast hands? shall the thing formed answer him that formed it?
45:10 As though one should say to
45:11 For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who has formed the things that are to come, Enquire of me concerning my sons, and concerning the works of my hands command me.
45:12 I have made the earth, and man upon it: I with my hand have established the heaven; I have given commandment to all the stars.
45:13 I have raised him up
45:14 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Egypt has laboured
45:15 For thou art God, yet we knew
45:16 All that are opposed to him shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall walk in shame: ye isles, keep a feast to me.
45:17 Israel is saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: they shall not be ashamed nor confounded for evermore.
45:18 Thus saith the Lord that made the heaven, this God that created the earth, and made it; he marked it out, he made it not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord, and there is none beside.
45:19 I have not spoken in secret, nor in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek vanity: I, even I, am the Lord, speaking righteousness, and proclaiming truth.
45:20 Assemble yourselves and come; take counsel together, ye that escape of the nations: they that set up wood,
45:21 If they will declare, let them draw nigh, that they may know together, who has caused these things to be heard from the beginning: then was it told you. I am God, and there is not another beside me; a just
45:22 Turn ye to me, and ye shall be saved, ye that
45:23 By myself I swear, righteousness shall surely proceed out of my mouth; my words shall not be frustrated; that to me every knee shall bend, and every tongue shall swear by God,
45:24 saying, Righteousness and glory shall come to him: and all that remove them from their borders shall be ashamed.
45:25 By the Lord shall they be justified, and in God shall all the seed of the children of Israel be glorified.
46:1 Bel has fallen, Nabo is broken to pieces, their graven images are gone to the wild beasts and the cattle: ye take them packed up as a burden to the weary, exhausted, hungry, and
46:2 who will not be able to save themselves from war, but they themselves are led
46:3 Hear me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of Israel, who are borne
46:4 I am
46:5 To whom have ye compared me? see, consider, ye that go astray.
46:6 They that furnish gold out of a purse, and silver by weight, will weigh it in a scale, and they hire a goldsmith and make idols, and bow down, and worship them.
46:7 They bear it upon the shoulder, and go; and if they put it upon its place, it remains, it cannot move: and whosoever shall cry to it, it cannot hear; it cannot save him from trouble.
46:8 Remember ye these things, and groan: repent, ye that have gone astray, return in your heart;
46:9 and remember the former things
46:10 telling beforehand the latter events before they come to pass, and they are accomplished together: and I said, All my counsel shall stand, and I will do all things that I have planned:
46:11 calling a bird from the east, and from a land afar off, for the things which I have planned: I have spoken, and brought
46:12 Hearken to me, ye senseless ones, that are far from righteousness:
46:13 I have brought near my righteousness, and I will not be slow with the salvation that is from me: I have given salvation in Sion to Israel for glory.
47:1 Come down, sit on the ground, O virgin daughter of Babylon: sit on the ground, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and luxurious.
47:2 Take a millstone, grind meal: remove thy veil, uncover thy white hairs, make bare the leg, pass through the rivers.
47:3 Thy shame shall be uncovered, thy reproaches shall be brought to light: I will exact of thee due vengeance, I will no longer deliver thee to men.
47:4 Thy deliverer is the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel is his name.
47:5 Sit thou down pierced with woe, go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: thou shalt no more be called the strength of a kingdom.
47:6 I have been provoked with my people; thou hast defiled mine inheritance: I gave them into thy hand, but thou didst not extend mercy to them: thou madest the yoke of the aged man very heavy,
47:7 and saidst, I shall be a princess for ever: thou didst not perceive these things in thine heart, nor didst thou remember the latter end.
47:8 But now hear these words, thou luxurious one,
47:9 But now these two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one day, the loss of children and widowhood shall come suddenly upon thee, for thy sorcery, for the strength of thine enchantments,
47:10 for thy trusting in wickedness: for thou saidst, I am, and there is not another: know thou, the understanding of these things and thy harlotry shall be thy shame; for thou saidst in thy heart, I am, and there is not another.
47:11 And destruction shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be aware;
47:12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the abundance of thy sorcery, which thou hast learned from thy youth; if thou canst be profited.
47:13 Thou art wearied in thy counsels. Let now the astrologers of the heaven stand and deliver thee, let them that see the stars tell thee what is about to come upon thee.
47:14 Behold, they all shall be burnt up as sticks in the fire; neither shall they at all deliver their life from the flame. Because thou hast coals of fire, sit thou upon them;
47:15 these shall be thy help. Thou hast wearied thyself with traffic from thy youth: every man has wandered to his own home, but thou shalt have no deliverance.
48:1 Hear these
48:2 maintaining also the name of the holy city, and staying themselves on the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name. The former things I have already declared;
48:3 and they have proceeded out of my mouth, and it became well known; I wrought suddenly, and
48:4 I know that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy forehead brazen.
48:5 And I told thee of old what
48:6 Ye have heard all this, but ye have not known: yet I have made known to thee the new things from henceforth, which are coming to pass, and thou saidst not,
48:7 Now they come to pass, and not formerly: and thou heardest not of them in former days: say not thou, Yea, I know them.
48:8 Thou hast neither known, nor understood, neither from the beginning have I opened thine ears: for I knew that thou wouldest surely deal treacherously, and wouldest be called a transgressor even from the womb.
48:9 For mine own sake will I shew thee my wrath, and will bring before thee my glorious acts, that I may not utterly destroy thee.
48:10 Behold, I have sold thee,
48:11 For mine own sake I will do
48:12 Hear me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I call; I am the first, and I endure for ever.
48:13 My hand also has founded the earth, and my right hand has fixed the sky: I will call them, and they shall stand together.
48:14 And all shall be gathered, and shall hear: who has told them these things? Out of love to thee I have fulfilled thy desire on Babylon, to abolish the seed of the Chaldeans.
48:15 I have spoken, I have called, I have brought him, and made his way prosperous.
48:16 Draw nigh to me, and hear ye these words; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning: when it took place, there was I, and now the Lord,
48:17 Thus saith the Lord that delivered thee, the Holy One of Israel; I am thy God, I have shewn thee how thou shouldest find the way wherein thou shouldest walk.
48:18 And if thou hadst hearkened to my commandments,
48:19 Thy seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy belly as the dust of the ground: neither now shalt thou by any means be utterly destroyed, neither shall thy name perish before me.
48:20 Go forth of Babylon, thou that fleest from the Chaldeans: utter aloud a voice of joy, and let this be made known, proclaim it to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath delivered his servant Jacob.
48:21 And if they shall thirst, he shall lead them through the desert; he shall bring forth water to them out of the rock: the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow forth, and my people shall drink.
48:22 There is no joy, saith the Lord, to the ungodly.
49:1 Hearken to me, ye islands; and attend, ye Gentiles; after a long time it shall come to pass, saith the Lord: from my mother's womb he has called my name:
49:2 and he has made my mouth as a sharp sword, and he has hid me under the shadow of his hand; he has made me as a choice shaft, and he has hid me in his quiver;
49:3 and said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, and in thee I will be glorified.
49:4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have given my strength for vanity and for nothing: therefore is my judgment with the Lord, and my labour before my God.
49:5 And now, thus saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his own servant, to gather Jacob to him and Israel. I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.
49:6 And he said to me,
49:7 Thus saith the Lord that delivered thee, the God of Israel, Sanctify him that despises his life, him that is abhorred by the nations that are the servants of princes: kings shall behold him, and princes shall arise, and shall worship him, for the Lord's sake: for the Holy One of Israel is faithful, and I have chosen thee.
49:8 Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee: and I have formed thee, and given thee for a covenant of the nations, to establish the earth, and to cause to inherit the desert heritages:
49:9 saying to them that are in bonds, Go forth; and
49:10 They shall not hunger, neither shall they thirst; neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; but he that has mercy on them shall comfort
49:11 And I will make every mountain a way, and every path a pasture to them.
49:12 Behold, these shall come from far:
49:13 Rejoice, ye heavens; and let the earth be glad: let the mountains break forth
49:14 But Sion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and, The Lord has forgotten me.
49:15 Will a woman forget her child, so as not to have compassion upon the offspring of her womb? but if a woman should even forget these, yet I will not forget thee, saith the Lord.
49:16 Behold, I have painted thy walls on my hands, and thou art continually before me.
49:17 And thou shalt soon be built by those by whom thou wert destroyed, and they that made thee desolate shall go forth of thee.
49:18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and look on them all; behold, they are gathered together, and are come to thee.
49:19 For thy desert and marred and ruined
49:20 For thy sons whom thou hast lost shall say in thine ears, The place
49:21 And thou shalt say in thine heart, Who has begotten me these? whereas I
49:22 Thus saith the Lord,
49:23 And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and their princesses thy nurses, they shall bow down to thee on the face of the earth, and shall lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and they that wait on me shall not be ashamed.
49:24 Will any one take spoils from a giant? and if one should take
49:25 For thus saith the Lord, If one should take a giant captive, he shall take spoils, and he who takes
49:26 And they that afflicted thee shall eat their own flesh; and they shall drink their own blood as new wine, and shall be drunken: and all flesh shall perceive that I am the Lord that delivers thee, and that upholds the strength of Jacob.
50:1 Thus saith the Lord, Of what kind is your mother's bill of divorcement, by which I put her away? or to which debtor have I sold you? Behold, ye are sold for your sins, and for your iniquities have I put your mother away.
50:2 Why did I come, and there was no man?
50:3 I will clothe the sky with darkness, and will make its covering as sackcloth.
50:4 The Lord
50:5 and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, opens mine ears, and I do not disobey, nor dispute.
50:6 I gave my back to scourges, and my cheeks to blows; and I turned not away my face from the shame of spitting:
50:7 but the Lord God became my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but I set my face as a solid rock; and I know that I shall never be ashamed,
50:8 for he that has justified me draws near; who is he that pleads with me? let him stand up against me at the same time: yea, who is he that pleads with me? let him draw nigh to me.
50:9 Behold, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will hurt me? behold, all ye shall wax old as a garment, and a moth shall devour you.
50:10 Who is among you that fears the Lord? let him hearken to the voice of his servant: ye that walk in darkness, and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon God.
50:11 Behold, ye all kindle a fire, and feed a flame: walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which ye have kindled. This has happened to you for my sake; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
51:1 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, and seek the Lord: look to the solid rock, which ye have hewn, and to the hole of the pit which ye have dug.
51:2 Look to Abraam your father, and to Sarrha that bore you: for he was alone when I called him, and blessed him, and loved him, and multiplied him.
51:3 And now I will comfort thee, O Sion: and I have comforted all her desert places; and I will make her desert places as a garden, and her western places as the garden of the Lord; they shall find in her gladness and exultation, thanksgiving and the voice of praise.
51:4 Hear me, hear me, my people; and ye kings, hearken to me: for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment
51:5 My righteousness speedily draws nigh, and my salvation shall go forth as light, and on mine arm shall the Gentiles trust: the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
51:6 Lift up your eyes to the sky, and look on the earth beneath: for the sky was darkened like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and the inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my righteousness shall not fail.
51:7 Hear me, ye that know judgment, the people in whose heart is my law: fear not the reproach of men, and be not overcome by their contempt.
51:8 For as a garment will be devoured by time, and as wool will be devoured by a moth,
51:9 Awake, awake, O Jerusalem, and put on the strength of thine arm; awake as in the early time, as the ancient generation.
51:10 Art thou not it that dried the sea, the water,
51:11 for by
51:12 I,
51:13 And thou hast forgotten God who made thee, who made the sky and founded the earth; and thou wert continually afraid because of the wrath of him that afflicted thee: for
51:14 For in thy deliverance he shall not halt, nor tarry;
51:15 for I am thy God, that troubles the sea, and causes the waves thereof to roar: the Lord of hosts is my name.
51:16 I will put my words into thy mouth, and I will shelter thee under the shadow of mine hand, with which I fixed the sky, and founded the earth: and
51:17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury: for thou hast drunk out and drained the cup of calamity, the cup of wrath:
51:18 and there was none to comfort thee of all the children whom thou borest; and there was none to take hold of thine hand, not even of all the children whom thou hast reared.
51:19 Wherefore these things are against thee; who shall sympathise with thee in thy grief? downfall, and destruction, famine, and sword: who shall comfort thee?
51:20 Thy sons are the perplexed ones, that sleep at the top of every street as a half-boiled beet; they that are full of the anger of the Lord, caused to faint by the Lord God.
51:21 Therefore hear, thou afflicted one, and drunken,
51:22 thus saith the Lord God that judges his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of calamity, the cup of my wrath; and thou shalt not drink it any more.
51:23 And I will give it into the hands of them that injured thee, and them that afflicted thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may pass over: and thou didst level thy body with the ground to them passing by without.
52:1 Awake, awake, Sion; put on thy strength, O Sion; and do thou put on thy glory, Jerusalem the holy city: there shall no more pass through thee the uncircumcised and unclean.
52:2 Shake off the dust and arise; sit down, Jerusalem: put off the band of thy neck, captive daughter of Sion.
52:3 For thus saith the Lord, Ye have been sold for nought; and ye shall not be ransomed with silver.
52:4 Thus saith the Lord, My people went down before to Egypt to sojourn there; and were carried away forcibly to the Assyrians.
52:5 And now why are ye here? Thus saith the Lord, Because my people was taken for nothing, wonder ye and howl. Thus saith the Lord, On account of you my name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles.
52:6 Therefore shall my people know my name in that day, for I am he that speaks: I am present,
52:7 as a season of beauty upon the mountains, as the feet of one preaching glad tidings of peace, as one preaching good news: for I will publish thy salvation, saying, O Sion, thy God shall reign.
52:8 For the voice of them that guard thee is exalted, and with the voice together they shall rejoice: for eyes shall look to eyes, when the Lord shall have mercy upon Sion.
52:9 Let the waste places of Jerusalem break forth
52:10 And the Lord shall reveal his holy arm in the sight of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation that
52:11 Depart ye, depart, go out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of her; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.
52:12 For ye shall not go forth with tumult, neither go by flight: for the Lord shall go first in advance of you; and the God of Israel shall be he that brings up your rear.
52:13 Behold, my servant shall understand, and be exalted, and glorified exceedingly.
52:14 As many shall be amazed at thee, so shall thy face be without glory from men, and thy glory
52:15 Thus shall many nations wonder at him; and kings shall keep their mouths shut: for they to whom no report was brought concerning him, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall consider.
53:1 O Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
53:2 We brought a report as
53:3 But his form was ignoble, and inferior to that of the children of men;
53:4 He bears our sins, and is pained for us: yet we accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffering, and in affliction.
53:5 But he was wounded on account of our sins, and was bruised because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
53:6 All we as sheep have gone astray; every one has gone astray in his way; and the Lord gave him up for our sins.
53:7 And he, because of his affliction, opens not his mouth: he was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.
53:8 In
53:9 And I will give the wicked for his burial, and the rich for his death; for he practised no iniquity, nor craft with his mouth.
53:10 The Lord also is pleased to purge him from his stroke. If ye can give an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed:
53:11 the Lord also is pleased to take away from the travail of his soul, to shew him light, and to form
53:12 Therefore he shall inherit many, and he shall divide the spoils of the mighty; because his soul was delivered to death: and he was numbered among the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and was delivered because of their iniquities.
54:1 Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that dost not travail: for more are the children of the desolate than of her that has a husband: for the Lord has said,
54:2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and of thy curtains: fix
54:3 spread forth
54:4 Fear not, because thou hast been put to shame, neither be confounded, because thou wast reproached: for thou shalt forget thy former shame, and shalt no more at all remember the reproach of thy widowhood.
54:5 For
54:6 The Lord has not called thee as a deserted and faint-hearted woman, nor as a woman hated from
54:7 For a little while I left thee: but with great mercy will I have compassion upon thee.
54:8 In a little wrath I turned away my face from thee; but with everlasting mercy will I have compassion upon thee, saith the Lord that delivers thee.
54:9 From the time of the water of Noe this is my
54:10 shall the mountains depart, nor shall thy hills be removed: so neither shall my mercy fail thee, nor shall the covenant of thy peace be at all removed: for the Lord
54:11 Afflicted and outcast thou hast not been comforted: behold, I
54:12 and I will make thy buttresses jasper, and thy gates crystal, and thy border precious stones.
54:13 And
54:14 And thou shalt be built in righteousness: abstain from injustice, and thou shalt not fear; and trembling shall not come nigh thee.
54:15 Behold, strangers shall come to thee by me, and shall sojourn with thee, and shall run to thee for refuge.
54:16 Behold, I have created thee, not as the coppersmith blowing coals, and bringing out a vessel
54:17 I will not suffer any weapon formed against thee to prosper; and every voice that shall rise up against thee for judgment, thou shalt vanquish them all; and thine adversaries shall be
55:1 Ye that thirst, go to the water, and all that have no money, go
55:2 Wherefore do ye value at the price of money, and
55:3 Give heed with your ears, and follow my ways: hearken to me, and your soul shall live in prosperity; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, the sure mercies of David.
55:4 Behold, I have made him a testimony among the Gentiles, a prince and commander to the Gentiles.
55:5 Nations which know thee not, shall call upon thee, and peoples which are not acquainted with thee, shall flee to thee for refuge, for the sake of the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified thee.
55:6 Seek ye the Lord, and when ye find him, call upon him; and when he shall draw nigh to you,
55:7 let the ungodly leave his ways, and the transgressor his counsels: and let him return to the Lord, and he shall find mercy; for he shall abundantly pardon your sins.
55:8 For my counsels are not as your counsels, nor are my ways as your ways, saith the Lord.
55:9 But as the heaven is distant from the earth, so is my way distant from your ways, and your thoughts from my mind.
55:10 For as rain shall come down, or snow, from heaven, and shall not return until it have saturated the earth, and it bring forth, and bud, and give seed to the sower, and bread for food:
55:11 so shall my word be, whatever shall proceed out of my mouth, it shall by no means turn back, until all the things which I willed shall have been accomplished; and I will make thy ways prosperous, and
55:12 For ye shall go forth with joy, and shall be taught with gladness: for the mountains and the hills shall exult to welcome you with joy, and all the trees of the field shall applaud with their branches.
55:13 And instead of the bramble shall come up the cypress, and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle: and the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign, and shall not fail.
56:1 Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my mercy to be revealed.
56:2 Blessed is the man that does these things, and the man that holds by them, and keeps the sabbaths from profaning them, and keeps his hands from doing unrighteousness.
56:3 Let not the stranger who attaches himself to the Lord, say, Surely the Lord will separate me from his people: and let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree.
56:4 Thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, as many as shall keep my sabbaths, and choose the things which I take pleasure in, and take hold of my covenant;
56:5 I will give to them in my house and within my walls an honourable place, better than sons and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, and it shall not fail.
56:6 And
56:7 I will bring them to my holy mountain, and gladden them in my house of prayer: their whole-burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations,
56:8 saith the Lord that gathers the dispersed of Israel; for I will gather to him a congregation.
56:9 All ye beasts of the field, come, devour, all ye beasts of the forest.
56:10 See how they are all blinded: they have not known;
56:11 Yea, they are insatiable dogs, that know not what it is to be filled, and they are wicked, having no understanding: all have followed their own ways, each according to his own
57:1 See how the just man has perished, and no one lays
57:2 His burial shall be in peace: he has been removed out of the way.
57:3 But draw ye near hither, ye lawless children, the seed of adulterers and the harlot.
57:4 Wherein have ye been rioting? and against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye loosed your tongue? are ye not children of perdition? a lawless seed?
57:5 who call upon idols under the leafy trees, slaying your children in the valleys among the rocks?
57:6 That is thy portion, this is thy lot: and to them hast thou poured forth drink-offerings, and to these hast thou offered meat-offerings. Shall I not therefore be angry for these things?
57:7 On a lofty and high mountain, there is thy bed, and thither thou carriedst up thy meat-offerings:
57:8 and behind the posts of thy door thou didst place thy memorials. Didst thou think that if thou shouldest depart from me, thou wouldest gain? thou hast loved those that lay with thee;
57:9 and thou hast multiplied thy whoredom with them, and thou hast increased the number of them that are far from thee, and hast sent ambassadors beyond thy borders, and hast been debased even to hell.
57:10 Thou hast wearied thyself with thy many ways; yet thou saidst not, I will cease to strengthen myself: for thou hast done these things; therefore thou hast not supplicated me.
57:11 Through dread of whom hast thou feared, and lied against me, and hast not remembered, nor considered me, nor regarded me, yea, though when I see thee I pass thee by, yet thou hast not feared me.
57:12 And I will declare thy righteousness, and thy sins, which shall not profit thee.
57:13 When thou criest out, let them deliver thee in thine affliction: for all these the wind shall take, and the tempest shall carry
57:14 And they shall say, Clear the ways before him, and take up the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people.
57:15 Thus saith the Most High, who dwells on high for ever, Holy in the holies, is his name, the Most High resting in the holies, and giving patience to the faint-hearted, and giving life to the broken-hearted:
57:16 I will not take vengeance on you for ever, neither will I be always angry with you: for my Spirit shall go forth from me, and I have created all breath.
57:17 On account of sin for a little while I grieved him, and smote him, and turned away my face from him; and he was grieved, and he went on sorrowful in his ways.
57:18 I have seen his ways, and healed him, and comforted him, and given him true comfort;
57:19 peace upon peace to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh: and the Lord has said, I will heal them.
57:20 But the unrighteous shall be tossed as troubled waves, and shall not be able to rest.
57:21 There is no joy to the ungodly, said God.
58:1 Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up thy voice as with a trumpet, and declare to my people their sins, and to the house of Jacob their iniquities.
58:2 They seek me day by day, and desire to know my ways, as a people that had done righteousness, and had not forsaken the judgment of their God: they now ask of me righteous judgment, and desire to draw nigh to God,
58:3 saying, Why have we fasted, and thou regardest not?
58:4 If ye fast for quarrels and strifes, and smite the lowly with
58:5 I have not chosen this fast, nor
58:6 I have not chosen such a fast, saith the Lord; but do thou loose every burden of iniquity, do thou untie the knots of hard bargains, set the bruised free, and cancel every unjust account.
58:7 Break thy bread to the hungry, and lead the unsheltered poor to thy house: if thou seest one naked, clothe
58:8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall speedily spring forth: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall compass thee.
58:9 Then shalt thou cry, and God shall hearken to thee; while thou art yet speaking he will say, Behold, I am here. If thou remove from thee the band, and the stretching forth of the hands, and murmuring speech;
58:10 and
58:11 and thy God shall be with thee continually, and thou shalt be satisfied according as thy soul desires; and thy bones shall be made fat, and shall be as a well-watered garden, and as a fountain
58:12 And thy old waste desert
58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, so as not to do thy pleasure on the holy days, and shalt call the sabbaths delightful, holy to God;
58:14 then shalt thou trust on the Lord; and he shall bring thee up to the good places of the land, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
59:1 Has the hand of the Lord no power to save? or has he made his ear heavy, so that he should not hear?
59:2 Nay, your iniquities separate between you and God, and because of your sins has he turned away
59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with sins; your lips also have spoken iniquity, and your tongue meditates unrighteousness.
59:4 None speaks justly, neither is there true judgment: they trust in vanities, and speak empty
59:5 They have hatched asps' eggs, and weave a spider's web: and he that is going to eat of their eggs, having crushed an addled egg, has found also in it a basilisk.
59:6 Their web shall not become a garment, nor shall they at all clothe themselves with their works; for their works are works of iniquity.
59:7 And their feet run to wickedness, swift to shed blood; their thoughts also are thoughts of murder; destruction and misery are in their ways;
59:8 and the way of peace they know not, neither is there judgment in their ways; for their paths by which they go are crooked, and they know not peace.
59:9 Therefore has judgment departed from them, and righteousness shall not overtake them: while they waited for light, darkness came upon them; while they waited for brightness, they walked in perplexity.
59:10 They shall feel for the wall as blind
59:11 They shall proceed together as a bear and as a dove: we have waited for judgment, and there is no salvation, it is gone far from us.
59:12 For our iniquity is great before thee, and our sins have risen up against us: for our iniquities are in us, and we know our unrighteous deeds.
59:13 We have sinned, and dealt falsely, and revolted from our God: we have spoken unrighteous words, and have been disobedient; we have conceived and uttered from our heart unrighteous words.
59:14 And we have turned judgment back, and righteousness has departed afar off: for truth is consumed in their ways, and they could not pass by a straight
59:15 And truth has been taken away, and they have turned aside
59:16 And he looked, and there was no man, and he observed, and there was none to help: so he defended them with his arm, and stablished
59:17 And he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and placed the helmet of salvation on his head; and he clothed himself with the garment of vengeance, and with his cloak,
59:18 as one about to render a recompence,
59:19 So shall they of the west fear the name of the Lord, and they
59:20 And the deliverer shall come for Sion's sake, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
59:21 And this shall be my covenant with them, said the Lord; My Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put in thy mouth, shall never fail from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy seed, for the Lord has spoken it, henceforth and for ever.
60:1 Be enlightened, be enlightened, O Jerusalem, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
60:2 Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and
60:3 And kings shall walk in thy light, and nations in thy brightness.
60:4 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold thy children gathered: all thy sons have come from far, and thy daughters shall be borne on
60:5 Then shalt thou see, and fear, and be amazed in thine heart; for the wealth of the sea shall come round to thee, and of nations and peoples; and herds of camels shall come to thee,
60:6 and the camels of Madiam and Gæpha shall cover thee: all from Saba shall come bearing gold, and shall bring frankincense, and they shall publish the salvation of the Lord.
60:7 And all the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered, and the rams of Nabæoth shall come; and acceptable sacrifices shall be offered on my altar, and my house of prayer shall be glorified.
60:8 Who are these
60:9 The isles have waited for me, and the ships of Tharsis among the first, to bring thy children from afar, and their silver and their gold with them, and
60:10 And strangers shall build thy walls, and their kings shall wait upon thee: for by reason of my wrath I smote thee, and by reason of mercy I loved thee.
60:11 And thy gates shall be opened continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; to bring in to thee the power of the Gentiles, and their kings as captives.
60:12 For the nations and the kings which will not serve thee shall perish; and those nations shall be made utterly desolate.
60:13 And the glory of Libanus shall come to thee, with the cypress, and pine, and cedar together, to glorify my holy place.
60:14 And the sons of them that afflicted thee, and of them that provoked thee, shall come to thee in fear; and thou shalt be called Sion, the city of the Holy One of Israel.
60:15 Because thou hast become desolate and hated, and there was no helper, therefore I will make thee a perpetual gladness, a joy of many generations.
60:16 And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt eat the wealth of kings: and shalt know that I am the Lord that saves thee and delivers thee, the Holy One of Israel.
60:17 And for brass I will bring thee gold, and for iron I will bring thee silver, and instead of wood I will bring thee brass, and instead of stones, iron; and I will make thy princes peaceable, and thine overseers righteous.
60:18 And injustice shall no more be heard in thy land, nor destruction nor misery in thy coasts; but thy walls shall be called Salvation, and thy gates Sculptured Work.
60:19 And thou shalt no more have the sun for a light by day, nor shall the rising of the moon lighten thy night; but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and God thy glory.
60:20 For the sun shall no more set, nor shall the moon be eclipsed; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be completed.
60:21 Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, preserving that which they have planted,
60:22 The little one shall become thousands, and the least a great nation; I the Lord will gather them in
61:1 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me; he has sent me to preach glad tidings to the poor, to heal the broken in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind;
61:2 to declare the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of recompence; to comfort all that mourn;
61:3 that there should be given to them that mourn in Sion glory instead of ashes, the oil of joy to the mourners, the garment of glory for the spirit of heaviness: and they shall be called generations of righteousness, the planting of the Lord for glory.
61:4 And they shall build the old waste places, they shall raise up those that were before made desolate, and shall renew the desert cities,
61:5 And strangers shall come and feed thy flocks, and aliens
61:6 But ye shall be called priests of the Lord, the ministers of God: ye shall eat the strength of nations, and shall be admired because of their wealth.
61:7 Thus shall they inherit the land a second time, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head.
61:8 For I am the Lord who love righteousness, and hate robberies of injustice; and I will give their labour to the just, and will make an everlasting covenant with them.
61:9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring in the midst of peoples: every one that sees them shall take notice of them, that they are a seed blessed of God;
61:10 and they shall greatly rejoice in the Lord.
61:11 And as the earth putting forth her flowers, and as a garden its seed; so shall the Lord,
62:1 For Sion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as light, and my salvation burn as a torch.
62:2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and kings thy glory: and one shall call thee
62:3 And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
62:4 And thou shalt no more be called Forsaken; and thy land shall no more be called Desert: for thou shalt be called My Pleasure, and thy land Inhabited: for the Lord has taken pleasure in thee, and thy land shall be inhabited.
62:5 And as a young man lives with a virgin, so shall thy sons dwell in
62:6 And on thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen all day and all night, who shall never cease making mention of the Lord.
62:7 For there is none like you, when he shall have established, and made Jerusalem a praise on the earth.
62:8 For the Lord has sworn by his glory, and by the might of his arm, I will no more give thy corn and thy provisions to thine enemies; nor shall strangers any more drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured.
62:9 But they that have gathered them shall eat them, and they shall praise the Lord; and they that have gathered
62:10 Go through my gates, and make a way for my people; and cast the stones out of the way; lift up a standard for the Gentiles.
62:11 For behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth, say ye to the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy Saviour has come to thee, having his reward and his work before his face.
62:12 And one shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord: and thou shalt be called a city sought out, and not forsaken.
63:1 Who is this that is come from Edom,
63:2 Wherefore are thy garments red, and thy raiment as
63:3 I am full of trodden
63:4 For the day of recompence has come upon them, and the year of redemption is at hand.
63:5 And I looked, and there was no helper; and I observed, and none upheld: therefore my arm delivered them, and mine anger drew nigh.
63:6 And I trampled them in mine anger, and brought down their blood to the earth.
63:7 I remembered the mercy of the Lord, the praises of the Lord in all things wherein he recompenses us. The Lord is a good judge to the house of Israel; he deals with us according to his mercy, and according to the abundance of his righteousness.
63:8 And he said, Is it not my people? the children surely will not be rebellious: and he became to them deliverance
63:9 out of all their affliction: not an ambassador, nor a messenger, but himself saved them, because he loved them and spared them: he himself redeemed them, and took them up, and lifted them up all the days of old.
63:10 But they disobeyed, and provoked his Holy Spirit: so he turned to be an enemy, he himself contended against them.
63:11 Then he remembered the ancient days,
63:12 who led Moses with his right hand, the arm of his glory? he forced the water
63:13 He led them through the deep, as a horse through the wilderness, and they fainted not,
63:14 and as cattle through a plain: the Spirit came down from the Lord, and guided them: thus thou leddest thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
63:15 Turn from heaven, and look from thy holy habitation and
63:16 For thou art our Father; for
63:17 Why hast thou caused us to err, O Lord, from thy way?
63:18 that we may inherit a small part of thy holy mountain.
63:19 We are become as at the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us, and thy name was not called upon us.
64:1 as wax melts before the fire; and fire shall burn up the enemies, and thy name shall be manifest among the adversaries: at thy presence the nations shall be troubled,
64:2 whenever thou shalt work gloriously; trembling from thee shall take hold upon the mountains.
64:3 From of old we have not heard, neither have our eyes seen a God beside thee, and thy works which thou wilt perform to them that wait for mercy.
64:4 For
64:5 and we are all become as unclean, and all our righteousness as a filthy rag: and we have fallen as leaves because of our iniquities; thus the wind shall carry us
64:6 And there is none that calls upon thy name, or that remembers to take hold on thee: for thou hast turned thy face away from us, and hast delivered us up because of our sins.
64:7 And now, O Lord, thou art our Father, and we are clay, all
64:8 Be not very wroth with us, and remember not our sins for ever; but now look on
64:9 The city of thy holiness has become desolate, Sion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse.
64:10 The house, our sanctuary, and the glory which our fathers blessed, has been burnt with fire: and all our glorious things have gone to ruin.
64:11 And for all these things thou, O Lord, hast withholden thyself, and been silent, and hast brought us very low.
65:1 I became manifest to them that asked not for me; I was found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold, I am
65:2 I have stretched forth my hands all day to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to them that walked in a way that was not good, but after their sins.
65:3 This is the people that provokes me continually in my presence; they offer sacrifices in gardens, and burn incense on bricks to devils, which exist not.
65:4 They lie down to sleep in the tombs and in the caves for the sake of dreams,
65:5 who say, Depart from me, draw not nigh to me, for I am pure.
65:6 Behold, it is written before me: I will not be silent until I have recompensed into their bosom,
65:7 their sins and
65:8 Thus saith the Lord, As a grape-stone shall be found in the cluster, and they shall say, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for the sake of him that serves me, for his sake I will not destroy
65:9 And I will lead forth the seed
65:10 And there shall be in the forest folds of flocks, and the valley of Achor
65:11 But ye are they that have left me, and forget my holy mountain, and prepare a table for the devil, and fill up the drink-offering to Fortune.
65:12 I will deliver you up to the sword, ye shall all fall by slaughter: for I called you, and ye hearkened not; I spoke, and ye refused to hear; and ye did evil in my sight, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.
65:13 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall hunger: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall thirst: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
65:14 behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall cry for the sorrow of your heart, and shall howl for the vexation of your spirit.
65:15 For ye shall leave your name for a loathing to my chosen, and the Lord shall destroy you: but my servants shall be called by a new name,
65:16 which shall be blessed on the earth; for they shall bless the true God: and they that swear upon the earth shall swear by the true God; for they shall forget the former affliction, and it shall not come into their mind.
65:17 For there shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and they shall not at all remember the former, neither shall they at all come into their mind.
65:18 But they shall find in her joy and exultation; for, behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a joy.
65:19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and will be glad in my people: and there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping, or the voice of crying.
65:20 Neither shall there be there any more a
65:21 and they shall build houses, and themselves shall dwell in
65:22 They shall by no means build, and others inhabit; and they shall by no means plant, and others eat: for as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people, they shall long enjoy the fruits of their labours.
65:23 My chosen shall not toil in vain, neither shall they beget children to be cursed; for they are a seed blessed of God, and their offspring with them.
65:24 And it shall come to pass,
65:25 Then wolves and lambs shall feed together, and the lion shall eat chaff like the ox, and the serpent earth as bread. They shall not injure nor destroy in my holy mountain, saith the Lord.
66:1 Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of a house will ye build me? and of what kind
66:2 For all these things are mine, saith the Lord: and to whom will I have respect, but to the humble and meek, and the
66:3 But the transgressor that sacrifices a calf to me, is as he that kills a dog; and he that offers fine flour, as
66:4 I also will choose their mockeries, and will recompense their sins upon them; because I called them, and they did not hearken to me; I spoke, and they heard not: and they did evil before me, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.
66:5 Hear the words of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; speak ye, our brethren, to them that hate you and abominate you, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and may appear their joy; but they shall be ashamed.
66:6 A voice of a cry from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering recompence to
66:7 Before she that travailed brought forth, before the travail-pain came on, she escaped
66:8 Who has heard such a thing? and who has seen after this manner? Has the earth travailed in one day? or has even a nation been born at once, that Sion has travailed, and brought forth her children?
66:9 But I have raised this expectation, yet thou hast not remembered me, saith the Lord: behold, have not I made the bearing and barren woman? saith thy God.
66:10 Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and all ye that love her hold in her a general assembly: rejoice greatly with her, all that
66:11 that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolation; that ye may milk out, and delight yourselves with the influx of her glory.
66:12 For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I turn toward them as a river of peace, and as a torrent bringing upon them in a flood the glory of the Gentiles: their children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and comforted on the knees.
66:13 As if his mother should comfort one, so will I also comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
66:14 And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall thrive like grass: and the hand of the Lord shall be known to them that fear him, and he shall threaten the disobedient.
66:15 For, behold, the Lord will come as fire, and his chariots as a storm, to render his vengeance with wrath, and his rebuke with a flame of fire.
66:16 For with the fire of the Lord all the earth shall be judged, and all flesh with his sword: many shall be slain by the Lord.
66:17 They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, and eat swine's flesh in the porches, and the abominations, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.
66:18 And I
66:19 And I will leave a sign upon them, and I will send forth them that have escaped of them to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and to Greece, and to the isles afar off, to those who have not heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
66:20 And they shall bring your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord with horses, and chariots, in litters
66:21 And I will take of them priests and Levites, saith the Lord.
66:22 For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name continue.
66:23 And it shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath,
66:24 And they shall go forth, and see the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.
