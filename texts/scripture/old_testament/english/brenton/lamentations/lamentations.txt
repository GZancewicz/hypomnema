3:2 He has taken me, and led me away into darkness, and not
3:3 Nay, against me has he turned his hand all the day.
3:4 He has made old my flesh and my skin; he has broken my bones.
3:5 Beth.
3:6 He has set me in dark places, as them that have long been dead.
3:7 He has builded against me, and I cannot come forth: he has made my brazen
3:8 Gimel.
3:9 Daleth.
3:10 he has troubled me,
3:11 He pursued
3:12 He.
3:13 He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
3:14 I became a laughing-stock to all my people; and their song all the day.
3:15 Vau.
3:16 And he has dashed out my teeth with gravel, he has fed me with ashes.
3:17 He has also removed my soul from peace: I forgot prosperity.
3:18 Therefore my success has perished, and my hope from the Lord.

3:20 and my soul shall meditate with me.
3:21 This will I lay up in my heart, therefore will I endure.

3:28 He will sit alone, and be silent, because he has borne

3:32 Chaph.
3:33 He has not answered
3:34 Lamed.
3:35 to turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High,
3:36 to condemn a man
3:37 Who has thus spoken, and it has come to pass? the Lord has not commanded it.
3:38 Out of the mouth of the Most High there shall not come forth evil and good.

3:41 Let us lift up our hearts with
3:42 We have sinned, we have transgressed; and thou hast not pardoned.
3:43 Samech.
3:44 Thou hast veiled thyself with a cloud because of prayer, that I might be blind,
3:45 and be cast off.
3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouth against us.
3:47 Fear and wrath are come upon us, suspense and destruction.
3:48 Mine eye shall pour down torrents of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
3:49 Phe.
3:50 until the Lord look down, and behold from heaven.
3:51 Mine eye shall prey upon my soul, because of all the daughters of the city.

3:53 and laid a stone upon me.
3:54 Water flowed over my head: I said, I am cut off.
3:55 Koph.
3:56 Thou heardest my voice: close not thine ears to my supplication.
3:57 Thou drewest nigh to my help: in the day wherein I called upon thee thou saidst to me, Fear not.
3:58 Rechs.
3:59 Thou hast seen, O Lord, my troubles: thou hast judged my cause.
3:60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance,
3:61 Chsen.
3:62 the lips of them that rose up against me, and their plots against me all the day;
3:63 their sitting down and their rising up: look thou upon their eyes.
3:64 Thou wilt render them a recompence, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.
3:65 Thau.
3:66 Thou wilt persecute them in anger, and wilt consume them from under the heaven, O Lord.

4:21 Chsen.
4:22 Thau.
5:1 Remember, O Lord, what has happened to us: behold, and look on our reproach.
5:2 Our inheritance has been turned away to aliens, our houses to strangers:
5:3 we are become orphans, we have no father, our mothers are as widows.
5:4 We have drunk our water for money; our wood is sold to us
5:5 we have been persecuted, we have laboured, we have had no rest.
5:6 Egypt gave the hand
5:7 Our fathers sinned,
5:8 Servants have ruled over us: there is none to ransom
5:9 We shall bring in our bread with
5:10 Our skin is blackened like an oven; they are convulsed, because of the storms of famine.
5:11 They humbled the women in Sion, the virgins in the cities of Juda.
5:12 Princes were hanged up by their hands: the elders were not honoured.
5:13 The chosen men lifted up
5:14 And the elders ceased from the gate, the chosen men ceased from their music.
5:15 The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
5:16 The crown has fallen
5:17 For this has grief come; our heart is sorrowful: for this our eyes are darkened.
5:18 Over the mountain of Sion, because it is made desolate, foxes have walked therein.
5:19 But thou, O Lord, shalt dwell for ever; thy throne
5:20 Wherefore wilt thou utterly forget us, and abandon us a long time?
5:21 Turn us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be turned; and renew our days as before.
5:22 For thou hast indeed rejected us; thou hast been very wroth against us.
